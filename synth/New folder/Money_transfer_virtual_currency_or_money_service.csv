Please see the attached document."
2,Wells Fargo had money sent from another country dont remember the amount of millions. They said there was nothing want to final is it true or not?
3,"I was trying to rent a property at the beginning of XXXX, but after paying the first month 's rent and deposit, I still had not recieved the keys. I was offered a refund, but was never actually sent the money. I was reassured by my bank that i was protected on wiretransfers and that i would be able to get my money back in the event it was indeed a scam. On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a claim with my Wells Fargo bank for exactly that, expecting it to be an open and shut case. After a month of waiting and calling for updates, I had not recieved anything. On XX/XX/XXXX, another claim was created in hopes of escalating it. I did not hear anything on that either. Around XX/XX/XXXX, I finally spoke with a second level XXXX who emailed the claims department for escalation, filed another claim in XXXX separate departments, and notified me that the first initial claim was filed incorrectly. It is now XXXX, and I was facing eviction because I was relying on receiving my money weeks ago to pay it. I have been struggling since I moved in the middle of XXXX because I've been waiting for my {$3600.00} plus the wire transfer fees. I have now accrued {$380.00} in over draft fees that they have only paid {$140.00} back and tell me I'm liable for the rest. Despite being told by the second level XXXX that those would be reversed when the claim was resolved. XX/XX/XXXX, i called and complained to the XXXX office and the filed another claim and immediately assigned it. This was the only case XXXX to ever contact me for more information. As of XX/XX/XXXX, they resolved the claim and told me they could not get my money back without permission from the thief to take it from his account. Completely going against what I was promised by a wire transfer XXXX before I ever sent the money. I was told they would be liable for any overdrawn amount because the money wasn't their 's to steal. Now I am told there is nothing they can do because the money isnt there 3 months later. I was told when I first filed my claim, that it would take 10 business days for them to complete. Had they done that, the money may have still been there, but they also can't answer me when I tell them the scammer shared with me a certified letter from wells fargo that showed the money was flagged and pulled for suspicious activity so he no longer had it, they did. So now they made a profit and are unwilling to reverse charges. My account sits in the negative as I refuse to deposit anything, because this is their fault and I can not afford to pay an unnecessary debt and make ends meat. My family has had to go hungry and cold throughout this entire ordeal only to come out the other side worse off. If I did not have a support system to help with my bills, we would certainly have gone homeless."
4,"On XX/XX/23 I had a scammer call my cell using a Wells Fargo phone number. They tricked me into thinking someone was trying to access my funds in XXXX the country and trying to take {$7000.00} and needed to secure my account. They gained access to my phone thru XXXX and used "" Wells Fargo Security Server '' as the access name. They took full control of my phone and before I could blink were able to wire {$9400.00} out of my account. I went to a Wells Fargo bank immediately and had them cancel my accounts that the money was taken from. They advised "" They were so glad I came in right away and didn't wait until the next day because that would of been a totally different situation '' But since I had come in right away they could put a hold on that transfer and it still showed pending. 

I followed up with Wells Fargo fraud department on XX/XX/23 and they said it would take 5-10 business days for my funds to be available and they were still in the claims process. But I would get a return on the {$60.00} wire transfer fees as well. ( A total of {$9400.00} was taken from my account ) I called again on XX/XX/23 for another follow up. At that point they said they had denied my claim and I would not be getting my money back. They had already told me several times that I would and they put a stop on it since the wire transfers still showed pending! 

I am currently out {$9400.00} ... my dad had just given me this money a week prior for my wedding. I'm devastated!"
8,"XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Transfers unknown/unlisted on statements with destinations not mine. XXXX, totaling. 

Numerous bank triggered overdraft fees in above amount."
11,"I recently placed an item for sale on XXXX XXXX XXXX, a potential buyer contacted me to let me know that she was interested and would be sending a bank guaranteed check via registered mail. When the check for {$1900.00} arrived to cover the purchase price and transportation I deposited the check electronically into my Wells Fargo account on Sunday XXXX XX/XX/2023. While checking my bank account on Tuesday XXXX XXXX I noticed that the check had been cleared which concerned me that it had been cleared so quickly as I had read that checks can take XXXX days to clear. I then phoned the bank ( XXXX approximately XXXX ) to confirm that the check had been fully cleared and approved, I was told that it had, and everything was in order and the funds where available to be used. 

Soon after this call the buyer contacted me to say that her child had been involved in an accident and she needed to cancel the transaction and asked me to return {$1300.00} of the funds. I then transferred {$1300.00} via XXXX into her account in the evening of Tuesday XXXX XXXX. 

On the XXXX XXXX, midday, I was checking my bank details again and I noticed that the check was now showing as pending. I drove directly to my Wells Fargo bank in XXXX XXXX to find out what was going on. I was told by Wells Fargo that the check now looked suspicious, hence the revert back to pending status, and at their recommendation I cancelled my old account checking account and created a new one as this now looked like a scam. 

At the bank they created an incident report and contacted the banks fraud department who said that they would get back to me within XXXX to XXXX days. Due to the lack of response, I phoned Wells Fargo on several occasions to follow up on the status of the {$1300.00} I am out of pocket. I was transferred between the fraud department, customer complaints and the XXXX department XXXX XXXX trying to find out who could help me with this issue. I asked XXXX if they could contact the receiving bank and was told that they had sent a request and that is all they could do. All departments said they could not help me and that I had been scammed. The original deposit was reversed by the fraud department which I totally agree on. On XXXX of the calls, I was put through to a claims dispute department and they said they would follow up. I then received a call from them and they said there was nothing they could do about it. I again told them that Wells Fargo was responsible for allowing me to transfer {$1300.00} from the check and that I would like a copy of the voice recording where Wells Fargo assured me that the check was cleared and there was no problem with it. Again, they said they would get back to me. I received an email Monday, XXXX XXXX stating that I would need a court order to obtain a copy of the recording and if I felt I was a victim of a financial crime I should contact law enforcement. 

By nature, I am a very cautious person, and I would never have transferred the funds if I had not received confirmation directly from the bank that the check had been fully cleared, as such I believe that the bank is accountable and as such should refund the {$1300.00}."
15,"Wellsfargo Bank claimed to have mailed me a cashier 's check for {$230.00} on XX/XX/2017, in which I never received. I filed an affidavit regarding check # XXXX and Wells Fargo Unclaimed Property department replied that they received my inquiry but never got back to me any further about replacing the check."
16,"My mortgage company took two payments of {$3900.00} out of my checking account on XXXX XXXX. 
Which put my account in negative status. 
Then on XXXX th my mortgage company XXXX sent both payments back to my account that should have put my account into a positive status of {$3900.00}. That did not happen. The money just disappeared and Wells Fargo gave me the run around as to where my money went. My money was never recovered, my questions never answered and no one could explain why."
21,"Summary : I am a victim of an elaborate job posting scam that began XX/XX/2022 which led to me sending a recipient two XXXX  transfers using the XXXX service offered thru my bank Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2022, to pay for training materials and a laptop. Note the scammer had sent me a check for XXXX the day before, to cover the XXXX XXXX transfers however it turned out to be stolen. 

1st XXXX transfer was done XX/XX/2022 at XXXX EST. 
2nd XXXX transfer was done XX/XX/2022 at XXXX EST. 
At XXXX the scammer then requested I locate a "" XXXX XXXX '' ATM right away to exchange XXXX cash for XXXX. I did not complete this request and I called Wells Fargo at XXXX to report the scam transaction and to have the XXXX transfers reversed. They left me with the impression I should get the funds back in about 10 days but that didn't happen. 

Notices I received days later via us post office from Wells Fargo : 1 ) Notice dated XX/XX/2022 acknowledging fraud claim XXXX submission and that they are looking into the matter. 

2 ) Notice dated XX/XX/2022 stating they determined the payments were processed as requested however as a courtesy they will continue to attempt to assist with a resolution with the receiving financial institution. 

3 ) Noticed dated XX/XX/2022 stating the two XXXX transfers have already been approved and processed and they are unable to stop or reverse the funds. Also they notified the receiving financial institution and XXXX Network about the scam and they submitted a request to have the funds returned however it is not guaranteed. They have closed the claim. 

It is a very poor business practice to process XXXX transactions without a reasonable window of time to reverse the transaction especially with the number of scams happening these days. Note these ( 2 ) transactions were to purchase a laptop and training materials and even though it was under fraudulent pretenses, I paid for something I didn't get and Wells Fargo and XXXX should provide a form of purchase protection if not like one receives with credit card purchases. 

I have a lot of support documentation to provide if needed : Initial text offering to engage in an interview with a link to access the scammer Chat history using XXXX application with the scammer Image of stolen check and the XXXX envelope used to send it to me. 
Wells Fargo notices received in the mail as described above. 
Documents provided by scammer : Job Offer Letter, Code of Business Conduct, I-9 form and W-4 Screen shots of the XXXX transactions Screen shot of the call time to Wells Fargo to report the fraud Emails between myself and scammer and more. 

Thank you kindly in advance for any help you could offer in getting my XXXX back."
22,"I deposited a cashiers check on XX/XX/XXXX of a total amount of {$10000.00} to my wellsfargo saving account. My receipt stated funds would be available on XXXX/XXXX/23 and they were not. I went to the bank directly and teller informed me a second hold was placed on the check and that I would have to resolve the issue with customer service. I called customer service regarding the issue and was informed a message was sent to me via the app messaging system regarding the hold. I never received an email regarding a new message on my wellsfargo app or an email regarding the hold on the cashiers check. I spoke with customer service and they informed me there was nothing they could do to expedite the process or release the funds. 

My wellsfargo mobile app shows the funds in green as processed and does not state any message regarding the funds pending for any reason which is leading to confusion. 

I then had the person who wrote the check contact their bank ( XXXX ) and on their end they stated there were no issues disclosed with the account the check originated from and that the funds were released to wellsfargo on XX/XX/XXXX/23."
23,"I do not have an account with Wells Fargo but wanted to cash a check drawn on that bank. I was in the XXXX, Nevada branch on XX/XX/2020 about XXXX and the teller asked for identification. I gave her my driver 's license and XXXX XXXX XXXX. She wrote my personal ID number from the driver 's license on the back of the check. I told her that she should not be doing this as it is giving my personal information to other people. This is the second time this has happened at this branch. She said it was Wells Fargo policy. Thank you in advance for helping me.

27,"As indicated in complaint # XXXX, an international wire transfer of XXXX GBP from my daughter 's XXXX XXXX account to my checking account in Wells Fargo, XXXX GA, was never deposited. After 7 months of inquiries and complaints, Wells Fargo confirmed they deposited the money in the wrong account, and that they were not responsible. They told us our only recourse was to sue the fraudulent party ; however, they can not give us their identity. 

The facts are that the account number in the transfer was missing a digit ... no accounts in GA have that number of digits, The name and address of the recipient were mine! Wells Fargo did not meet any banking standard and participated in fraudulent transfer of funds. The recipient, according to Wells Fargo, contends that the funds are no longer available. Their error cost my daughter over {$7000.00}. She was transferring money to pay for her school loan."
28,"I, XXXX  report to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in compliance with the Electronic Funds Act of 1978 ( Regulation E ) that I was induced and scammed by a third party to transfer funds out of my account XXXX XXXX in Wells Fargo XXXX 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from a number exactly alike from that of my bank and was asked and induced to transfer funds alleging that in order to get money back that was subtracted from my account I was to make several transfers of funds through XXXX. The third party knew my bank information, my card security code and called from a number exactly from that of the bank. 

I detail the XXXX transfers bellow : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  I request the CFBP to make an investigation as my funds where transferred/subtracted with a scam mechanism and also request a refund of my funds since as a consumer I should be protected against this type of criminal activity. 
WELLS FARGO and XXXX have not favorably responded to my request of a full refund of my money but they should have a detailed summary as to what fraudulent account my money was actually transferred to and should be able to trace it."
29,"On XX/XX/2022 I reported a scam to XXXX for a {$230.00} transaction. Within minutes of the transaction, I attempted to cancel it but XXXX wouldn't allow me. I attempted to request a refund the next day, but that didn't work either. When reporting the XXXX user as a scam, it automatically blocks the account so I can't see if it's still active on XXXX. I tried contacting customer support, but they only had a chat bot. I asked the chat bot for a phone number numerous times and was never provided with a number for a live agent. 
I then disputed the transaction where the money transmission came from - my Wells Fargo checking account. I sent Wells Fargo all of the chat transcripts, logs, and receipts, but never received confirmation that they received the information or reviewed it. Several days later, I called Wells Fargo claim support and asked numerous times if they received the email where I sent every detail about the dispute. I was told it doesn't matter because they won't honor XXXX transaction disputes. I asked to speak to a manager, but was transferred to an escalation call center where the agent repeatedly only said, "" we won't honor this dispute. '' I spent a ton of time and effort doing my due diligence to have to follow up myself and simply be told no one will help me. 
I was dismissed by XXXX and I was dismissed by my bank ( Wells Fargo ) despite having FDIC insurance that is supposed to protect me from scams and fraud like this. If Wells Fargo won't even submit a chargeback for blatant scams such as this, they are encouraging the proliferation of scam artists on these apps because there's no repercussions."
30,I initiated an instant transfer from my XXXX account to my Wells Fargo account in the amount of {$3.00} on XX/XX/20. XXXX indicated funds availability on XX/XX/20. The funds were delayed by Wells Fargo and not available until XX/XX/20.
33,On XX/XX/XXXX {$45.00} on XXXX went to the wrong person ( complete stranger ). On XX/XX/XXXX the bank was contacted to send the money to the correct person the phone number was one digit off. The bank said it would take 10 days to correct but never corrected it. Now XX/XX/XXXX they are saying they can't do anything about it.
36,"I tranfer money using XXXX  a total of XXXX and the receipient did not received it. So I try again and was not received. Then I try with XXXX dollar and same thing kept happening. I call the bank XXXX and created a ticket and I was given a reference # and was told they would look into it. Its been XXXX   days and still I havent gotten my refund. 

Date of tranfer was XX/XX/XXXX for a total of {$400.00}"
37,"There were XXXX XXXX transfers taken from my bank account from Wells Fargo bank totaling {$870.00}. Wells Fargo states that me or someone I gave authority to made the transactions to an unknown person and there was no other processing errors by the bank. 
I was left with {$.00}. I did not XXXX money to anyone leaving me and my wife both XXXX seniors without food or medications necessary to sustain us. I am an XXXX XXXX XXXX veteran who has never sent a XXXX and am technologically challenged. I need to make a complaint against Wells Fargo bank."
39,On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email. from Wells Fargo stating that my Wells Fargo business account had been compromised and to please give Wells Fargo a call. I was busy working and did not see the email so Wells Fargo called me and said a wire transfer of {$13000.00} had been initiated. I stated I did not do that and and the said to read off the verification code that was texted to me and I did. they said they would cancel my cards and bank accounts and rush me new cards. so I waited tell Friday XXXX days later and nothing happened so I went into the bank and explained my situation. They stated that they did not know what was going on and transferred the money sense I gave them the verification code which I did not do! Turns out that I was talking to fraudsters on the phone and gave them the verification number. Wells Fargo has stated this is all my fault. I have made a police report with the XXXX  XXXX police department.
44,"On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo closed an account I had opened with them on behalf of my father using my power of attorney. They had allowed me to open the account and I had deposited into the account money from the sale of his property. I had used that money then to pay off some of his debts. A few months later Wells Fargo informed me that I didn't have the proper power of attorney to open the account and told me I had to go to a branch and close it. I went to my local branch and they issued me a Cashiers ' check for {$8500.00}. When I asked them when the check would expire they told me that it would not expire. For various reasons I let the check sit. 

Two weeks ago I went again and opened another account for my dad using my Power of Attorney. This time I was told I had all the proper paperwork and the account was opened. I deposited the cashier 's check into the account after the banker assured me I would have access to the funds. At no time did the banker helping me tell me this would be an issue. A few days later I log in and find out that the check had been deducted from the account. After several phone calls from me to them with no follow up from Wells Fargo I was told by Wells Fargo that my check had been sent to the State of Pennsylvania as unclaimed property in XXXX of XXXX. At no point in time did anyone inform me that this action would take place, nor did they send anything to my father because he also has my address. Now when I went to start my unclaimed property check with the state of pa, I found that they have no record of this being sent to them by Wells Fargo. The complaint department at Wells Fargo told me they couldn't at this time provide me of evidence that they had sent the money to the state. So as it stands right now my family has been robbed of {$8500.00}."

For now I want to start with a complaint against the miss use of my accounts with XXXX XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo please and thank you! XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX )
48,"My war with Wells Fargo Bank began XX/XX/2020. I made a {$1300.00} transfer from my XXXX  checking account to XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Alaska. Transfer went through but to a XXXX XXXX XXXX account located in Texas. This was the time XXXX was being accused of having fake accounts and transferring money into those accounts. I feel this is what happened to me as I do not have any bank accounts in Texas. I contacted XXXX immediately and was informed that this was a bank fraud and I went through that process. I was told that all XXXX had to do was contact the bank in Texas and dispute the transaction. They would not do this. A few days later, my XXXX checking account was closed without my knowledge or any prior notice. 

I have fought this for almost 18 months and have filed appeals on the XXXX decision. Their ultimate decision was that I "" authorized '' the transfer. I have argued that the money went into an account that was not mine. I was told they "" didn't care if the money went to XXXX XXXX, I authorized the transfer ''. This is totally a case of fraud and using my money for their advantage."
51,"Im selling a product at XXXXXXXX XXXX  cost {$30.00} only, the buyer sent the payment thru XXXX XXXX ( newly created acct ) and ask my email address for confirmation and then I received an email that my XXXX XXXX is acct restricted saying that my acct is limited and not a XXXX XXXX XXXX acct so I need to contact the buyer to send me {$300.00}.

He emailed me to tell me his wife and he bought this place in XXXX and the pictures were of his unit and they do not rent so this was false advertising and this ad was a spam. The scammer used the pictures from XXXX and description of the property to create the craigslist ad and even in gave me reference emails to contact of "" previous renters '' were also false responses since no one has rented this unit per real owner. His email is XXXXif you need to confirm ownership. He gave permission for me to give his contact info to my local sheriff dept to contact him for that reason. 
All emails form the scammer came from XXXX XXXX  XXXX is copy of a header of one email : On Thu, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX ( Direct Owner XXXX ) Since discovering this was scam he has never responded to me emails. He always answered my questions about this place in a way that would make me believe it was true and reliable I had no down there I know as I am in MI to check it out. He responded readily prior to receiving his money. 
The day I found out this was a scam I went to my bank to file a scam report and request my refund. They filed info with Wells Fargo and have received no reply as of yet. I also files a theft report with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and report number is XXXX. XXXX Co XXXX XXXX is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MI XXXX. Detective XXXX XXXX is assigned to this case.

I am told by my credit union Wells Fargo is notorious and never replying to requests of this nature and is a "" corrupt bank ''. I am asking for my reimbursement of my {$4000.00}. I see on line Wells Fargo has a find for this ordered through the government. Perhaps I can reimbursement through that find with this form being filed? 
I have emails saved in my possession related to renting this place and am in process of getting a copy of the police report. I reported the scam to XXXX. The posting was removed from XXXX about 2 weeks before I found out it was a scam. I tried calling Wells Fargo myself and filed a complaint since the credit union wasn't receiving a response. I was transferred to four different people telling me the "" next dept could help me '' and finally being told this is handled through the "" back door and only the credit union can deal with this since I am not an account holder at Wells Fargo. '' My credit union account number is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The two emails that I received as references for this rental that I'm thinking the scammer routed back to him to answer were : XXXX and XXXX. Both responded positively about the person renting from, the unit being great and area beautiful. Not sure if you needed that info or not but sent so you haver as much info as possible. 
I answered the question prior to this description asking if I can receive and disperse fund through a wallet on my account as yes because it is my checking account and I transfer money in and out of it I hope that was the correct answer. 
I look forward to your investigation of this and perhaps getting my reimbursement for the crooked transaction and scam I was taken on. Thank you! I appreciate any of your efforts to solve this."
53,"Wells Fargo, allowed the draining of my credit car and money withdrawn from my savings without my permission. My checking account at the time had a balance of {$8500.00} and a hacker got into my account while posing as a XXXX security agent. They took over the handling of my Wells Fargo Accounts and transferred money from my credit card to my savings and then from my savings account and Wells Fargo did not stop it. Even after I called to explained they said there was nothing they could do because it came from my XXXX address. Even though I explained and advised them the transfer was not authorized or done by me. They said because it came from my XXXX there was nothing they could do. Then they charged me an additional {$770.00} for a cash advance I did not authorize. So, I so I closed all of my accounts with Wells Fargo because they did not take protect my funds when they should have. Now I stuck paying advanced fee 's and {$14000.00} back for something I should have had to deal with it Wells Fargo had stop the transaction like they should have. 
When you review their communications, they could not get the total amount correct which lead to more confusion and wonder about their professionalism and being able to protect my funds."

55,On XX/XX/21 and XX/XX/21 the same person stole money from my Wells Fargo account and wrote a fraudulent check that was supposed to repay some of the stolen funds and the check was fraud too.

She could not explain why the funds laid dormant in the "" Paid in Full '' mortgage account for 4 days. The clerk told me that they could refund the money to me, but that the funds would have to be send back through the "" Bill Pay '' that I used to pay the mortgage. I then clearly explained that the "" Bill Pay '' account that was used to send the funds was now cancelled and asked them to send a certified check to me and my wife instead of sending the funds back through a closed "" Bill Pay '' account. The clerk left the phone to confer with her supervisor. The clerk then told me that she would have them mail a check on Monday XX/XX/XXXX and That I would get the check on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX.

61,"On XX/XX/2020 I used XXXX via Wells Fargo to make a {$350.00} payment to a man for the purchase of a puppy for my wife, the next day on XX/XX/2020 I sent the final amount of {$350.00} ( for a total of {$700.00} ) after I received what I believe to be an actual video of the dog complete with the man calling the dog by the name we where going to give it and the date and an email with the bill of sale. On XX/XX/2020 I received an email from a company claiming to need {$1000.00} "" pet insurance '' to send the puppy via airplane. I knew immediately that we had been scammed and attempted to get our money back. The man claimed he was going to the airport to cancel the flight and would refund us our money the night of XX/XX/XXXX. He has sinced blocked us and not been responsive. I was sceptical when he first mentioned XXXX but when I saw that it was endorsed by Wells Fargo I thought it could be trusted as the XXXX page looked legitimate and had a couple of people claiming to have purchased from him. The scammer was very reassuring during the process and even had a professional looking fake shipping company website that they used to try to get more money out of us. We have reported them to XXXX and warned others in my wifes pittbull group. I will be trying what ever I can to not only get our money back ( which is most likely gone ) but warn others. Avoid XXXX 's XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX and "" XXXX XXXX '' at all costs."
62,"I sent my daughter money via XXXX to an account that was closed and they never gave me my money back. I called and they said since it was through XXXX there wasnt anything I could do. I can not remeber exact amount it was for her and her husband tickets to a sporting event for her bday a few years back between $ XXXX {$1200.00} XXXX dont recall exact amount but I know it was between that because it caused major devastation. And I called and complained many times over the years about adding fees to my account and taking money even though I should of been grandfathered in but they told me that wasnt correct when in fact I was told many years ago I was correct. I have had a savings and checking account with them since 2010 and to this day still and having money taken. I am trying to not change banks because when I do actually get child support it is attached to this account and has been for 12yrs. They should just correct their mistakes, I shouldnt have to move businesses."
66,I was writing a person check and upon cashing it they told me that I could not get funds and pluse they they keep my deposit from my job I was getting ever two weeks. Not only they did that they close out all my account out.
67,"I attempted to transfer money from one account to another account of the same institution and used the option "" XXXX ''. The transfer requested either an email address or telephone number. I chose the second option because the intended recipient used telephone option. 
I mistakenly transposed the last digit in the telephone number and the money was sent to an account in a different financial institution. 
I was using Wells Fargo online for the transfer, both my account and the recipients account are with this institution. 
The transfer went to a XXXX account. 
I contacted Wells Fargo one hour after the transfer which was done on XX/XX/XXXX and initiated the complaint! On XX/XX/XXXX the intended recipient and I spoke to a Wells Fargo banker on a conference call in which the transposed digit error was determined to be the problem. I was assured that the error would be addressed and funds returned in 1-3 business days. 
I now have been informed by Wells Fargo that they can not get money back and that they only contacted "" XXXX '' to verify that the funds were delivered and that neither they nor XXXX can do anything more. They suggested that I contact the number used in an attempt to secure return of funds. I was told by Wells Fargo that the receiver must initiate return of funds! I asked for the account information associated with transfer and was denied and informed that they "" Wells Fargo '' did not contact "" XXXX ""!"
68,"On XX/XX/XXXX, There was man who put money into my account. They didn't tell me about it or even ask me about that amount. They just return the money back to the person."
69,"As a trustees for my sisters irrevocable trust, my brother and I authorized a transfer of funds from her XXXX XXXX account to her personal Wells Fargo account in the amount of {$35000.00}. The funds never arrived, and were apparently sent to an incorrect account number. Wells Fargo has not provided any answers, nor has it refunded the money. Our account advisors at XXXX XXXX have been actively seeking answers, but to no avail. 
We believe that Wells Fargo is fully aware of where the funds ended up, but have made no effort to retrieve them. 
The funds transfer occurred on Thursday XX/XX/2022 and it has now been almost 2 1/2 months that the funds have been held by Wells Fargo. 

It is worth noting that the funds were allocated to replace a car that had died unexpectedly. When the funds did not arrive, my sister was forced to pay an additional {$600.00} in car rental fees."
74,"On XX/XX/2020 I wanted to purchase an item online, the seller requested funds from XXXX to be transferred using his phone number instead of XXXX to avoid fees. I figured my bank should have fraud protection in case anything went wrong with XXXX and cover my money. I filed a claim with wells fargo and got absolutely no help and they said I cant get my {$500.00} back. I contacted the seller several times to get my money back and requested through XXXX and he declined. I called wells fargo before doing the transaction to ask if I was protected before doing so and the phone banker stated yes and I did he transfer."
75,"This is my second complaint to the CFPB regarding wells fargo. I have updated proof the bank needs to take into consideration before dismissing my claim. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I activated an old XXXX and purchased a new XXXX card for the device. The XXXX employee kept my old XXXX card but instead of disposing it, the card ended up in the hands of a hacker. 

I discovered fraudulent calls on my XXXX account and multiple XXXX cards linked to devices never owned by me that were being uploaded to my XXXX XXXX. My XXXX passwords were stolen along with my Wells Fargo online banking information. All of this began 10 days after I activated the old cell phone at a local XXXXXXXX store. 

On XX/XX/2022, I was locked out of my Wells Fargo online banking app and called the customer service line to inquire why this occurred. After changing my user name and password, my account was secure or so I thought. The fraud at XXXX is being investigated but this complaint is regarding my bank account and an illegal, unauthorized wire transfer that resulted from the initial identity theft. 

Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, XXXXthe day my online wells fargo bank account was accessed by a hacker and a wire transfer was made in the amount of {$24000.00}. I did not do the transfer nor did I turn on the wire transfer feature. Changes were made without my consent by an unknown individual. The same person hacked into my XXXX  along with my XXXX XXXX account. A sim card swap is how the perpetrator could have avoided two factor authentication when logging into my XXXX XXXX and XXXX account. Regardless of how the hacker initially obtained my information, the end result was an illegal wire transfer from my wells fargo business savings account. The hacking of my XXXX account allowed the hacker to obtain my banking information and reset my online banking password. Upon obtaining control of my account the person called me and pretended to be from wells fargo. He said there was potential debit card fraud on my account and needed to verify purchases. The person was in my account reading recent purchases that I had made so this scam was very convincing. He told me he needed to confirm my identity so he would be sending me a text with a 6 digit code to my phone. Wells Fargo does this same exact thing so once again, I was not aware I was being scammed. The person then began asking about purchases that were unfamiliar then said you definitely have fraud we need to close your debit cards and issue you new ones. He said he needed to send me another passcode in order to confirm the cards were being closed. Meanwhile, instead of verifying my identity he was making changes in my online account without my knowledge. The person made a {$4000.00} transfer from my business checking to my business savings, turned on the wire feature, added a random recipient, then transferred most of the funds out of my business savings account. 

Before I realized what was happening, the person told me to push add call then XXXX XXXX ( a series of numbers ). I trusted this person so I followed his instructions. He told me it was a new security feature that would send me fraud alerts on my phone. The code I entered displayed a screen that said data sharing and it allowed him to gain remote access to my cell phone and forward all data, calls, and text messages. It was at that moment I knew something was not right. I hung up and immediately in order to report the incident to Wells Fargo. 

After I reported the wire to Wells Fargo, I turned my phone off until I could head into an XXXX XXXX  to get my phone fixed. During this time, one of my clients tried calling me yet her call was rerouted to the man who pretended to be from wells fargo. He told her I was being held XXXX and if she ever wanted to see me again she needed to pay him. My client ( XXXX XXXX XXXX called the XXXX police department to report the abduction. Shortly after, two officers were sent to my home to do a wellness check. 

I had to get my XXXX reset to factory settings at XXXX the same afternoon ( XX/XX/2022 ) in order to stop the data/call forwarding and phone harassment. I have police reports verifying the information in this complaint is factual. The phone reset is what allowed me to see devices I have never owned connected and erased to the XXXXXXXX XXXX associated with the XXXX card left at XXXX. I also have proof of my XXXX  and XXXX account hacked with unknown devices logged in the day the wire occurred. 

Additionally, I had to close my business email account and purchase a new phone/phone number. My business savings account was illegally accessed from a device not belonging to me so this should be provable by looking at the IP addresses or device locations. 

I NEVER gave anyone my online user name or password. I have NEVER used wire transfers the entire time I have had an account with wells fargo ( Over 7 years ). My wire transfer feature has never been activated the entire time I have had an account at Wells Fargo ( Over 7 years ). The account the funds were stolen from an account I make deposits to 95 % of the time. If I do make an occasional withdrawal, it will be an amount from my business savings going directly into my business checking so I can cover my rent payment on the 1st of the month. The activity on the day the wire was done was extremely unusual and Wells Fargo FAILED to flag the wire and verify if I was the person authorizing the transfer. This is a Regulation E violation. The transfer was done before XXXX XXXX but due to the long hold times I experienced before I could report the incident along with multiple transfers to different departments, the XXXX minute cancellation window passed and the wire recall effort was unsuccessful. Long hold times and transfers to multiple departments when calling wells fargo customer service is another form of bank negligence when someone is a victim of fraud. Time is of the essence yet Wells Fargos policies are designed to cause the customer harm instead of getting the victim help and recourse. Not all banks operate in this manner. XXXX XXXX has a live human answer the phone each time a customer calls. 

Despite all the proof I have, Wells Fargo has never asked to see any police report or piece of evidence proving I was a victim of fraud. I have receipts for everything and proof of multiple XXXX cards being added to devices I have never owned which were then linked to my XXXX account. This is a very big crime that involves multiple people and two large corporate entities with poor consumer security in place. Wells Fargo is using a disclosure loophole regarding the online access agreement, Deposit Account Agreement, and Online Wire Terms and Conditions agreement. The bank claimed I should be aware of their polices and understand if a wire is done through my account ( User name and password ) I am liable. My user name was used but a new password I did not create or authorize was used to get into my account, therefore this is not a valid argument since my phone was HACKED!! I personally did not do not violate any disclosure agreements. I personally did not use my username or password to do the wire and this CAN BE PROVEN with data only wells fargo has access to. I dont even have the account information where the money was sent. I tried calling XXXX to report the bank account and name of the recipient but they said they couldnt help me because I didnt have enough information. 

I opened my account several years ago and followed all disclosure agreements and protocols on order to keep my business account in good standing. The disclosure agreements are designed to inform a bank customer of the banks policies but hacking is not explicitly stated in the disclosures. I have never heard of a scam like this so the fact that I was tricked is not my fault. Someone lied to me and pretended to be from the bank then proceeded to STEAL my money. This is BANK ROBBERY! 

Wells Fargo is trying to avoid any liability for having low level business account security. I am not the first or last person to report a similar case of wire fraud yet the bank fails to change security measures to protect customers against this type of fraud. If the bank knows of a vulnerability point for customers but fails to change anything then the fraud is intentionally being allowed and I plan on publicly exposing this atrocious financial scam to the public via local news stations and social media accounts. Wells Fargo should do also do a better job of informing customers about current scams and problems targeting business accounts. 

My money should have been insured, safe, and secure in my own account and better protected considering Wells Fargo has been aware of this type of scam for several months. The fact that the bank allowed a password change, activation of the wire transfers feature, and such a large amount to be withdrawn in under a 9 min window without verifying I gave permission is negligent and dangerous for ALL customers banking with wells fargo. 

This has been a traumatic experience that does not seem to end. For three months, I have made endless complaints with wells fargo, FTC, FCC, XXXX, Local law enforcement, CFPB, and more. I am still locked out of most of my own accounts and have lost even more money paying for new devices combined with the loss income from taking time off work since all of this is so time consuming. 

The worst part is the financial institution I trusted is failing to take any responsibility for making this type of scam very accessible and easy for a hacker to do electronically. Wells Fargo needs to do a better job at verifying electronic transfers especially since the feature to wire money was turned on during the pandemic. This is a new feature many long term customers may not be aware of. Stop allowing customers to have their money stolen via wire transfer!!!!!!! Turn the feature off since it is being exploited by the wrong type of people!!!!!! 

One would assume with all the scams and negative press wells Fargo has had in recent years, the bank would use an opportunity like this with countless evidence to make the right choice for a customer. Especially since, I did not make the transfer! I know my rights and I know the bank has the power to reimburse me yet wells fargo is refusing. Why wont you give me my money back??? This is illegal!!! I was robbed!!!!! I will continue to complain and seek legal council until I get my money back one way or another."

They initiated a wire transfer in the amount of {$49000.00} to Wells Fargo account XXXX ( see wire transfer confirmation and enlarged pages ). This was fraud. Wells Fargo was alerted by our bank 's fraud team, bit delayed the response for a swift recovery allowing the fraud actor to withdraw the funds. The delay, which was not reasonable, provided an extended window of opportunity for the fraud actor to withdraw the funds. However, the issue should never had been able to transpire in the first place. Wells Fargo was negligent in its interactions with the fraud actor by allowing this account to be opened in the first place. Wells Fargo failed to take commercially reasonable steps to prevent the fraud activity. The account was opened using the name "" XXXX XXXX XXXX Services '' out of California. A simple and basic record search with the California Secretary of State would have identified no such entity exists ( see 2-page screen shot of the Secretary of State website showing no such entity exists ). The negligent manner Wells Fargo sought a new account rather than taking its own policies for verification is further idiotic as the address for this fraud account actor is listed at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX CA, XXXX. A basic "" XXXX '' online search ( results attached ) shows this as a XXXX room shack property, certainly not reasonable to be an XXXX XXXX XXXX. Either of these methods used to take commercially reasonable efforts to verify the valid identity of this fraudster would have and should have raised concerned if in fact these were properly verified before allowing them to open the beneficiary account with Wells Fargo.

THEN HE SAID HE WAS SWITCHING ME TO THE OFFICE HANDLING THE CASE. I CHECKED WEBSITE IT WAS XXXX XXXX. AND NUMBER CALLING FROM ON MY CALLER ID WAS FROM XXXX XXXX. SO I BELIEVED IT WAS LEGITIMATE. HE TOLD ME MY PHONE DIDNT HAVE THE APP. AND SAID I HAVE TO GET ANOTHER PHONE THAT HAS APP ON IT. I SAID WHAT IS APP HE SAID WHAT I NEED TO SEND PICTURES BACK AND FORTH. SO I WENT TO XXXX XXXX AND GOT A PHONE THAT HAD APP ON IT. I TOLD HIM I GOT THE APP PHONE AND HE SENT ME FROM XXXX PHOTOS OF : 1 ) ACCOMPLICE & CRIME COMMITTED, 2 ) PICTURE OF WANTED/WARRANT FOR MY ARREST, 3 )  DOCUMENT TO FREEZE MY ACCOUNT. 

HE SAID I SOLD MY INFORMATION/IDENTITY TO THE MAN IN PICTURE ( 1 ).

I RECEIVED A PICTURE WITH XXXX IN CORNOR WHERE TO WIRE MONEY TO XXXX XXXX   XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) WITH THE INFORMATION WHERE TO WIRE THE MONEY WITH ACCT #, AND RECEPIENTS INFORMATION. THEN I ASKED WHY I HAD TO SEND THE MONEY. SHE SAID HAVE TO PUT IT INTO ACCOUNT WHILE THEY INVESTIGATE THE CASE.

SHE SAID I WAS BEING WATCHED ALL THE TIME SO DONT GO TO POLICE OR TELL ANYONE THAT WE ARE WATCHING YOU AND WILL ARREST YOU OR HARM YOU.. 


SHE SENT ME THE WANTED PICTURE AGAIN AND INFO TO FREEZE MY ACCOUNT AGAIN. I SAID HOW DO I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

THEN SHE WANTED ME TO SEND PICTURES OF THE WIRE TRANSFER PAPERWORK AGAIN SO I DID AND THEN SHE SENT ME A RECEIPT FOR XXXX AND SAID MONEY BEING HELD AND WOULD BE RETURNED IF EVERYTHING CHECKED OUT. 

Around 10 days later on XX/XX/XXXX after I realized what had happened filled a police report and I called the banks and I went back to the Banks to asked them if they could reverse the transfer because I had been scammed. When I showed them the transfer papers they said well you said you were wiring the money to a friend to open a business, she said this means you lied. I told her I had to I was being threatened on the phone while I was transferring the money. She said the money has been sent already there is nothing we can do it is gone. I suggest you contact XXXX XXXX police Dept and let them know and gave me a sheet of paper with the information on it. 

Around XX/XX/XXXX a woman called me from the Wells Fargo bank and said the money had already been picked up by the recipients husband and it was gone. Now how can the recipients husband pick up money if his name isnt on the transfer. Dont they watch this kind of stuff. What is the sense of having a recipient. Or does it just go into their account and whoever is on the account can pick up the money. Seems like some sort of ID should be shown at the other end to accept this money and not have it just deposited into an account. How do you catch the fraud if anyone can pick up the money at the other end. 

XX/XX/XXXX WENT TO THE FBI AND TALKED TO XXXX XXXX AT FBI SAID TO STOP TEXTING HER. MR. XXXX SAID TO GO TO BANKS AND TRY TO HAVE THEM PUT HOLD/FREEZE ON XXXX XXXX XXXX ACCOUNT AND FUNDS. TOLD HIM XXXX CONSOLATE IN XXXX SAID WOULD SEND ME INFORMATION ON WHAT TO DO BUT NEVER SENT INFORMATION. HE SAID TO CALL AGAIN GET NAME OF WHO I TALK TO AND TELL THEM XXXX XXXX FROM FBI WILL BE CONTACTING THEM. TO MAKE SURE THAT I FILE A XXXX XXXX POLICE REPORT. I TOLD HIM THAT I TRIED 5 TIMES WOULDNT ACCEPT IT. HE SAID MAKE FILE SMALLER. 

XX/XX/XXXX WHEN I WENT HOME I MADE FILE SMALLER AND THE FILE FINALLY WENT THROUGH AND I WAS ABLE TO FILE A REPORT WITH THE XXXX XXXX POLICE DEPT. I CALLED XXXX CONSOLATE IN XXXX XXXX AGAIN AND TALKED TO MR. XXXX AND HE SAID TO SEND MY INFORMATION TO XXXX AND WHEN HE RECEIVED EMAIL THAT HE WILL SEND ME THE INFORMATION ON WHAT I NEED TO DO. I SEND XXXX XXXX AT FBI A COPY OF EMAIL WITH HIS NAME. THE CONSOLATE IN XXXX XXXX NEVER SENT ME INFORMTION I REQUESTED. 

THE WEEK OF XX/XX/XXXX A SOCIAL WORKER NAMED XXXX CAME TO TAKE ELDER ABUSE CASE INFORMATION BECAUSE XXXX XXXX TURNED THE WIRE TRANSFER CASE IN AS ELDER ABUSE. SHE WAS SURPRISED THAT THE OTHER 3 BANKS HADNT TURNED IN ELDER ABUSE CASES YET BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO REPORT ACCOUNT FRAUD OF ELDERLY PEOPLE AS ELDER ABUSE. BUT SHE PROBABLY WOULD GET THE OTHER 3 CASES SOON. ASKED IF SHOULD GO TO BANKS AND HAVE THEM FREEZE XXXX XXXX ACCOUNT LIKE XXXX XXXX AT FBI SAID. SHE SAID NO AND SHE DIDNT KNOW WHY HE WOULD TELL ME TO DO THAT. ABOUT HALF HOUR AFTER SHE LEFT SHE CALLED MY NEIGHBOR THAT IS HELPING ME WITH THE FRAUD CASE AND SHE TOLD HER THAT XXXX XXXX AND I WERE RIGHT THAT SHE DID SOME CHECKING AND THAT I HAVE TO GO TO BANKS AND HAVE THEM PUT HOLD OR DEBIT ( FREEZE ) ON XXXX XXXX XXXX ACCOUNT IF POSSIBLE. 

XX/XX/XXXX TALKED TO OFFICER XXXX XXXX SHERIFFS ASKED HIM ABOUT THE COPY OF CASE FILED WITH XXXX POLICE THAT I NEEDED IT FOR XXXX XXXX ASAP. HE SAID THEY ARE BACKED UP USUALLY 10-15 DAYS SHOULD HAVE REPORT. ANOTHER OFFICER WOULD PROBABLY BE FOLLOWING UP ON CASE AND HE SAID TO GIVE ALL OF THE BANKS A COPY OF POLICE REPORT NUMBER FOR XXXX AND XXXX XXXX AND THE LIST OF ALL OF THE PLACES THAT I HAVE FILED COMPLAINTS. 

XX/XX/XXXX I went into Wells Fargo because the FBI and the XXXX Sheriff told me to take all my paperwork and everyone I had reported the scam to, into the Banks and maybe something can be done. I talked to XXXX I think her name was at Wells Fargo on XXXX XXXX, told her that I wanted to know what was going on about a retraction on the wire transfer claim but I forgot my claim number. She called the wire transfer department. She got off the phone and said nothing can be done they picked up the money on the other end. I am sorry but the money is gone. I said if tellers know about the scams why dont they tell the people wiring the money about it. She said because when we question the wire transfers the customers get mad and yell at us and say just transfer the money. Did they ever think the people got mad because they were being threatened like I was. I dont think someone really wiring money to a friend or relative would get angry, they probably would thank the Teller for being concerned about that much money being wired. 

When I went home I picked up the mail and there was a letter from Wells Fargo stating they were working on the claim I put in and working with the other bank to try to get my money back and they would be back in touch with me and send me a letter letting me know if the money was put back into my account or let me know anything they found out about the case and that it could take anywhere from 60-120 days to investigate. 

Now which is it. The money is gone and nothing they can do or are they working with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to try to get my money back as the letter states? How can you go into the bank and they tell you the money is gone and nothing can be done. Then you get a letter saying they are investigating the claim the same day as the Teller I talked to was on the phone with the claim people and said they said there is nothing that can be done. Something does not sound right. Two complete different answers to the same claim."

107,"I had a personal check from my XXXX bank stolen from USPS somewhere between me putting it in a local mailbox and it traveling to its intended target- the City of LA XXXX XXXX offices. The check, which was in the amount of {$500.00} and made out to "" The City of LA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' and dated XX/XX/XXXX, was intercepted in the mail. The amount was changed to {$9500.00}, the check was signed by an individual on the back, and then cashed at a XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. I first reported this to my local XXXX bank on XX/XX/XXXX, at which point I filled out a Declaration of Unauthorized Endorsement or Altered Item at their request. I was told I didn't have to do anything else, and that my funds would be recovered in XXXX days, so no later than XX/XX/XXXX. When XX/XX/XXXX came and went with no updates, I revisited the same local XXXX branch. I was told that they had no paper trail of my complaint. While I am certain that they could pull camera footage to show me filling out paperwork in XXXX, the nightmare had begun. I filed the same paperwork at the same bank on XX/XX/XXXX. This time, they recommended that I call the claims department to confirm receipt a week later. I did, and they confirmed receipt on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told to wait another 90 days for the case to be solved, even though I explained that I had already waited 90 days and it was past due.

The delayed solution caused me serious financial distress, as I struggled to cover expenses and taxes. I was given a new deadline by XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. I filed a police report on XX/XX/XXXX. After interacting via phone with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I was given a new deadline of XX/XX/XXXX. I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that the case was still open, but that I had to wait 120 days instead of 90. I was given no additional info. I called again XX/XX/XXXX, so past the 120 days, and I was told it still hadn't been solved. My case was escalated internally at XXXX at this point. on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX told me that "" Wells Fargo has a backlog '' and that they could not give me a time frame. On XX/XX/XXXX I also filed a complaint with the CFPB, nine months after it all started, and received a written response from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX as a result. The response essentially just told me to continue to wait, with no deadlines or updates provided. Somehow, the CFPB considered this response to be perfectly acceptable, and closed my unsolved case. In XXXX of XXXX I interacted with XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX separate occasions over the phone, she was my escalation contact. She repeatedly told me to keep waiting, stressing that Wells Fargo had been unresponsive. I also tried the regular XXXX Claims Department helpline and visting a physical XXXX Bank location in person for help, with no success. In XXXX I spoke several times with XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He told me to keep waiting. On XX/XX/XXXX I received written correspondence from Wells Fargo after reporting them to the CFPB. They said that they could not share any information with me, and that I had to go through my bank ( XXXX ) for updates, despite the fact that my check was fraudulently cashed at Wells Fargo. In the letter, sent to me 10 months after I first filed my claim, they acknowledged that such cases are usually solved within 120 days. Between XXXX and XXXX of XXXX I called XXXX, XXXX, and the claims department so many times I lost count. They told me to keep waiting for a solution. On XX/XX/XXXX I was sent a letter from XXXX saying that they were not able to recover my funds as the depositing bank ( Wells Fargo ) was not responding. They closed my case. I have copies of the check, the tax bill it was originally for, a log of all communication, and more. Please help!"

They gave me a trial session for eah child and then I decided to go forward. I opted to choose the 3mth sessions for each child and paid {$190.00} on XX/XX/20. Then he started asking to do trial for another instrument. I said not until I start receiving the classes for which I paid. Then I received a text that was timed at XXXX, "" why did I not come line online, if I was having internet issues. '' I advised no such thing. Then was advised to use a link, could not access it, got no help and after that could not reach anyone for help. XXXX then said he quit the company. Then he said there was a server issue, how would he know that if he did not work there anymore. They would send a text when I complained but nothing when I respond. Once I asked for a refund heard nothing and then reached out to Wells Fargo, who gave a temporary credit and then rebilled us. 
I did get one request to close my dispute and then they will credit me but I did not trust that they would really do so. Also how does Wells Fargo accept the response from them, it was not even XXXX months when I contacted then, so even then obviously fee would be for 2 months at least refunded.

111,"I am a Wells Fargo customer with multiple business and personal accounts. Prior to an "" update '' of XXXX and the WF system in XXXX, I was able to make XXXX payments from any account at any time. When the "" update '' occurred, I was unable to make payments from more than one account without unregistering and reenrolling with each and every payment from a different account. 

In mid XXXX I called WF and received tech support and was assigned case # XXXX. I spent several hours on the phone with them as they attempted to trouble shoot. 

A few days later I received a call back and was told this is an ongoing issue with the "" update '' and customers with business/multiple accounts and they would get it resolved. 

A few weeks later on XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email saying the issue was resolved. I was traveling in an area where I could not make toll free calls and was unable to call back until around the XXXX of XXXX to ask why the issue had been closed since it hadn't been resolved. The XXXX apologized and said the issue was ongoing and being fixed manually account by account and they said they'd reopen the issue and that it shouldn't have been closed. They also told me that I'd move back to the top of the Q since I was one of the very first calls about the system glitch. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called back and was routed through the WF phone system to a supervisor in Banking ( XXXX XXXX - Alabama ). She told me that she didn't know about the issue but after being on hold with tech support, there was nothing they could do. I had also been told by an earlier agent that my case had never been reopened and it was still closed. 

I tried to confirm that she was now telling me that everything I was told was incorrect and I would need to unenroll and reenroll every time I needed to make a payment. She stated tech support told her there was nothing wrong with my account and would not give me a final answer to the question and told me to go to a branch. 

The call ended at that point. 

I can not get a straight answer out of WF as to why I have lost major functionality and use of this system in which i use to pay vendors. I do not understand why I was told they had to fix the issue and that it was a customer by customer fix and now I'm being told that I have to live with this very time intensive "" new '' process. 

I was also told tech support would not speak to me directly ; yet back in XXXX and XXXX they were connecting me to them as soon as I called with a case number. What is the point of Wells Fargo customer service if you can't even speak directly to the group that's responsible for addressing your issue? I do not grasp how a banker is equipped to handle these concerns nor why WF has a policy of not letting customers speak to the group that is able to either properly explain or fix an issue."

Wells Fargo sends a letter to me in XX/XX/XXXX stating congratulations the loan was paid off with a release of mortgage. Wells Fargo has never disclosed how the loan was paid off or why the Foreclosure was dismissed. I had an attorney at the time who I was paying a monthly bill to help me save my home.

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX claims to have been paying extra home insurance on the home, Taxes, Wells Fargo transferred loan adding taxes to this amount. The amount Im alleged to owe with XXXX XXXX  XXXX is over XXXX on a home that is under water and worth less than XXXX. This is fraud, because I did not do any of this. Im being harassed by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX for money that I do not rightfully owe. I also recently discovered that Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX removed my name on the loan documents, and placed my former attorneys name to receive my loan billing statements. In the end my attorney claims to not know anything. Then later my former Attorney stated that he thinks XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX paid it off.

Wells Fargo had me sign a loan Modification that originated by XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX VA loan that I had on the home in XXXX. The loan was alleged to be acquired by Wells Fargo in XXXX.

XXXX XXXX XXXX - This a document that was Submitted to the XXXX with false claims that the home was vacant.

Then she seems to not be sure what bank she is alleged to be working with. But have uploaded old outdated documents from XXXX XXXX  XXXX. The Vacancy document has XXXX  XXXX XXXX on it as well. This is wire transfer fraud scam that wired money to my former attorney for a settlement that I did not receive any money from. This is not about the false statements by Wells Fargo claiming the loan was paid off. The loan was forgiven for wrongdoing by Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo is working with XXXX XXXX  XXXX as well. The amount that was alleged to be paid to Wells Fargo from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX are totally different payment amounts. XXXX XXXX XXXX has one amount and Wells Fargo has another amount which is clearly fraud. Any payoff amount has to contain the exact same amount paid out and received. However, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX wants me to pay them back money that was never paid to Wells Fargo loan. Nor did I confirm anything for XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to pay off any Wells Fargo loan. Please look at the loan documents with my Former attorney 's mailing address on my statement for him to receive my pay statement only that I had no prior knowledge of. Nor did I authorize this with Wells Fargo or my former Attorney. A lawsuit was filed in Illinois against XXXX XXXX XXXX Involving XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX and Wells Fargo.

The FDIC records show that XXXX XXXXXXXX was acquired by XXXX not Wells Fargo. I have the proof and documents of all allegations. Wells Fargo dismissed both foreclosure actions were due to wrong doing not the loan being paid off. Now in XX/XX/XXXX the stories change that XXXX XXXX  XXXX paid off the loan to Wells Fargo which is false. Now XXXX XXXX  XXXX wants me to pay back a loan alleged to have been paid off to Wells Fargo. I did not authorize any payoff or loans or anything with XXXX XXXX  XXXX which is fraud. Please review document attachments. I'm consulting with attorneys regarding fraudulent activity... Wells Fargo continues to not answer or supply accurate information to my complaints filed. Please submit all responses to the lawsuit upload documents for review to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conceal fraud /Elder abuse. Wells Fargo also forged my name on documents as well.

119,"Hi Team I am raising a concern to CFPB regarding a fund transfer of {$2000.00} initiated from my bank ( Wells Fargo ) to XXXX ( an online XXXX exchange account ). 

I planned to invest some funds in the market ( online trading ) and sometime in late XXXX I have registered and setup an account with XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX & completed all background check verification by XX/XX/XXXX and added my Wells Fargo bank account on the same day. Later, I have initiated a fund transfer of {$2000.00} by XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX and XXXX uses XXXX to perform direct debit the amount from my bank. 

Over the internet I read some news that XXXX is collapsed and filed bankruptcy, from then XXXX not letting me to access my XXXX account nor able to access my funds ( {$2000.00} ). I was helpless and even tried to report this issue to XXXX customer support team as well but unable to reach them at all. I have even sent an email regarding this to XXXX compliance team, legal team, etc., but no response from them. 

On seeing this issue in order to secure my funds, I immediately reported this to my bank ( Wells Fargo ) that the transaction made to XXXX seems fraudulent transaction to me and requested to file a case by XX/XX/XXXX. 

-No action was taken by Wells Fargo- XXXX case was generated ( Wells Fargo Fraud Case XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and said I will be receiving the temporary funds of {$2000.00} will be issued, but after that my bank not even sent any details regarding this for more than a week, no confirmation, no email communication or information about the steps taken regarding the issue. 

When I tried to reach them out by XX/XX/XXXX over the call, I was told that this case was denied, and they will not dispute the charges, also least bothered to address about the issue. They are not concerned about the customers, or the reason why a fraud claim was submitted. They just bluntly asked me to work with XXXX itself to retrieve my money and can not do anything by Wells Fargo to retrieve the money. 

I was helpless with XXXX and reached Wells Fargo & even my bank cornered me by not providing a right resolution to retrieve my funds back. 

Request to help me to get this issue resolved."
120,"Wells Fargo Complaint This is a complaint about how I, a Wells Fargo customer of 40 years, was treated earlier this year XXXX. I am asking Wells Fargo to reimburse me {$1300.00}. 

During the week of XXXX XXXX XXXX I initiated a wire transfer from my Well Fargo accounts to my bank in XXXX, XXXX, I think this was on XXXX XXXX. The next morning I went online to check the status of the transfer and found all my Wells Fargo accounts and credit cards frozen. I called Wells Fargo customer service including at least two people in the Fraud Department. Even though I gave the correct verbal password the Wells Fargo agents would not verify my identity nor would they unfreeze my accounts. They would not tell me why my accounts were frozen. They insisted that I return from XXXX to the United States to verify my identity with two forms of picture ID. 

On XXXX XXXX - XXXX I returned to XXXX XXXX and met with a bank officer, XXXX in XXXX CA. I presented my CA drivers license and my passport and my accounts were made available to me. She inquired as to why my accounts were frozen. She told me the following : I had recently changed my password - This is true. In XXXX XXXX I changed my Wells Fargo passwords. This is something I do every year. I is something computer specialists advise consumers to do periodically given the rash of identity theft in the US. 
I had opened a new checking account - This is true. I opened a new checking account as part of the process of separating finances from my wife at the time. We were going through a divorce. However, I have been a Wells Fargo customer since XXXX. Even with a new account I had a decades long continuous history with Wells Fargo I had tried to make a wire transfer to a foreign country - This is true. I had just moved to XXXX and opened a new bank account with XXXX XXXX in XXXX. I set up a wire transfer through the Wells Fargo website. I believe I also spoke to someone at Wells Fargo on the telephone to help me set up the wire transfer process. I initiated a {$200.00} transfer to test the wire transfer procedure. 

These 3 events apparently triggered the freezing of my accounts. 

In order to return to the US I had to borrow money to purchase a plane ticket. The flight time to and from the US is 18hrs. I had taxi expenses going to/from the airport and Wells Fargo bank. Food expenses while in the USA. 

Wells Fargo is a major US bank that offered international wire transfer services to its customers through its website. The website was designed for customers to set up international wire transfers on their own from their home computers. I appreciate that Wells Fargo performs fraud detection on its transactions. I liked the procedure of having a verbal password to verify my identity. However, Wells Fargo failed to honor the verbal password to identify me and appears to have no other procedures in place to identify customers remotely. 

I contacted Wells Fargo through their email customer contact. I described my complaint. They refused to reimburse me for the travel expenses associated with this event."
121,"Hi, I recently had a lot of issues with my Wells Fargo bank checking account and credit card. 

I had a fraudulent wire transfer transaction on XX/XX/2022 for {$10000.00} from the checking account. Money was transferred from the credit card to the checking account and then wire transferred to someone else 's bank account. I did not initiate any of these transactions. 

I filed a claim and put dispute request for the money with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo believed that my old mobile phone number was compromised and asked me to get a proof letter from my old phone XXXX XXXX. I switched my phone company to XXXX in XXXX of 2022 and haven't used that mobile number ever since then. I couldn't understand why I still had anything to do with the number. 
I sent Wells Fargo my last bill statement from the XXXX with XXXX balance for supporting document. It also shown that my number was cancelled since XX/XX/2022. About a month later, I received a rejection letter from Wells Fargo. 

Wells Fargo stated that I am still responsible for the mobile number that was used for those transactions and they will not return the fund to my account since there were no fund available.

I spoke with a representative that looked at the account. They started with telling me that it was not sent to the correct account due to my XXXX not being set up correctly. I said that it was correctly set up and gave them the account number. They checked and said I was correct. 

They then said it was due to my mother sending it as a bank-to-bank transfer as she has another bank. My mother also has a Wells Fargo account and has previously sent XXXX transactions to the correct account. They took a moment and said that they could see it was a Wells Fargo account. 

I told them that WellsFargo had even sent me a notice saying I received money via XXXX. The representative said that it was not accurate due to this being a bank-to-bank transaction. I reminded them that she was also a Wells Fargo customer. They told me that her account must have not been set up correctly and that I would have to add my account to her XXXX with my bank account number. 

I asked why the last transactions worked but this one did not. The representative said that it was because the XXXX was not set up correctly. They could not explain the difference and why it was different from before. XXXX on Wells Fargo 's app only allows us to add others using a phone number or email. 

Customer service sounded annoyed and was incredibly unhelpful. They tried to give me solutions that were not relevant and attempted to ignore all the information in order to end the call. There was no solution and they could not provide an answer as to why WellsFargo did not properly make the transaction."

XXXX, WA XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NC XXXX Greetings : In early XXXX, I signed a contract with a company called XXXX to purchase equipment that was difficult to obtain. They would add money to my XXXX XXXX visa account, and I could use that money to make purchases and send them away. On that basis, I agreed to make the purchases for XXXX and send them off. I was given a Wells Fargo business account number of XXXX with the name XXXX. From that account, money was added to my XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$20000.00} on XXXX and I checked online and was assured the money was there. I then made purchases and sent them off. Money in the amount of {$16000.00} was added on XXXX XXXX and again I made purchases and sent them off. On XXXX XXXX, the first two of these payments were reversed, leaving me stuck. I feared that the second would be reversed and called XXXX XXXX asking for them not to let that happen, but even so it was reversed posting XXXX XXXX. 
I believe that Wells Fargo has responsibility here. I know that checks that are cashed then bounce later, but I did not know that money could be transferred online from a valid account with sufficient funds and then reversed many days later without a court action. Ill bet this account does this many, many times per week. I believe this makes Wells Fargo complicit in fraud, as I believe that this account has been used in this way for a long time. I hired a private investigator who said literally hundreds of packages are sent daily to the address I shipped packages to, and I believe all of them are shipped by people like myself who are paid from a Wells Fargo account that allows the account to stop payment many days later, thus helping fraud happen. Had I known that it was possible for this payment from a Wells Fargo business account to be used in this way, I would not have made and sent those purchases. 
It should not be possible for someone to reverse a payment after many days simply by pushing a button. Commerce in the US would stop! Anyone stopping a payment should need to get a court order to do so. By allowing this kind of reversal without a court action, especially multiple times per week, Wells Fargo is complicit in allowing this kind of fraud to happen.

We caught the fraud almost immediately, and reported it to Wells Fargo within 3 hours. Wells Fargo stated they would work to recall the transfer, and told us to wait 10 business days for a result. This was an agonizing period of uncertainty for us, and we were startled by the callousness and defensiveness of Wells Fargo, and their inability to provide us with any additional information. At approximately 10 business days, we received an unsigned form letter stating that our claim had been denied. 

It's estimated that we've spent approximately XXXX in the ensuing weeks attempting to rectify this situation, and reach someone at Wells Fargo who could give us more information and advise what other steps could be taken. ( See attached documentation of our communication. ) We feel like we were constantly being transferred within the call center, and not able to provide any information or gain a better understanding of what happened. From the best of our understanding, Wells Fargo maintains that the transfer was verified from one our our devices, therefore absolving them of all responsibility. We believe the fraud occurred when someone impersonating a Wells Fargo employee contacted us to report fraudulent activity on our account. Our communication with this "" employee '' appeared to be in line with any and all previous communication we have had with Wells Fargo. We did not provide them with any sensitive information such as passwords or usernames, or any thing close enough to give them access to our account, but did read back a verification number at one point, which again seemed to be in line with previous communication. There has to be a more clear process for verifying such a large amount of money being sent from our account. 

Currently, Wells Fargo is holding us responsible for {$24000.00}, and in addition is adding finance charges and cash advance fees to our now maxed out credit card, which is now putting us over the limit, with a statement due. We are now concerned about the impact to our good credit that we've worked hard to maintain."
141,"XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$500.00} Filed claim within 1 hour of fraud on XX/XX/2021 Claim XXXX Provided Wells Fargo with all information needed to recover my money from the person who committed the fraud, provided his name, bank account, phone number and email. 
Wells Fargo should have stopped the transaction before the XXXX payment was made."
144,"On XX/XX/2019 we made an on-line international wire transfer payment to one of our contractors in the amount of XXXX euros that was promised to be delivered by XX/XX/2019 per Wells Fargo Bank. 
That has not happened and the funds are still in limbo today ( XX/XX/2019 ) with no specific reasons being given by the bank for the delay or who actually has possession of the funds. 

On XX/XX/2019 the contractor stated they still had not received the wire transfer. I called Wells Fargo Customer Support ( XX/XX/19 ) and after a long hold was told that "" someone '' had started a case file, but that "" someone '' did not have a name. I was given a file number and was told I had to go into the branch to get any further information. 

I took the case # to the XXXX XXXX branch and was assisted by XXXX to try and figure out what was going on. After passing through about 4 or 5 people, she found someone who knew what the number meant and they told her it was held because of the Invoice number in the "" Description '' area of the wire. The description area has nothing to do with the routing of the wire. The "" Description '' area does not allow symbols like hyphens, commas, periods, etc and all the description held was the written invoice number with a space where the period would have been and project name. The invoice number was written as "" XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. I was told it had been delayed all this time because they did not know what XXXX was. XXXX said she would answer the emailed question sent to her and all should be fine. Later that day she called to say it was still not processed for released and to check back the next day. 

When I called the next day XXXX was out and XXXX said she would check and get back to me. The following day ( XX/XX/19 ) XXXX called and said she thought it had been released. 

Today ( XX/XX/2019 ) I get a call from someone named XXXX who said he was with Wells Fargo and wanted to discuss a wire transfer but he needed personal information. Since, I did not know XXXX I asked for alternatives. He gave me a case number and said to call the Wells Fargo 800 #, hit 0, and request a banker to give the number to. I did that and got XXXX in on-line business banking. I gave him the case # that XXXX gave me ( different than the one received earlier ) and XXXX said that my birthdate, name, and position with the company were required to complete the wire process. He could not tell me what issues were holding up the transaction. Wells Fargo already has my info on file, so this could not be delaying this process and I am no closer to getting answers. 

I have an unhappy contractor who has not been paid and threatens to cease work that will be detrimental to our project deadline. I need to issue another payment and was waiting to clear this matter up and avoid the same issue on the next payment. I want the true issue disclosed and corrected and I want to know that this will not happen every time I send a wire to this company. If we have backlash from this issue that causes us to fail to meet our deadlines, I want Wells Fargo to be willing to cover the damages caused by their internal issues and inability to function and carry out their duty to deliver this wire in a timely manner. If there was an issue, I should have been contacted on day one. They had not contacted me before I approached them on XX/XX/19 to discuss the missing funds. They have my information on record. We have not had access to these funds since XXXX XXXX. Where have they been and who has been benefiting from their delay? 

Please help us get these funds delivered quickly to avoid repercussions caused by this delay that will be costly and in the millions. 

Thanks,"

And only after doing it we found out that the beneficiary of funds was a fraudulent supplier, who never had intention to build our stand. We declared the crime to FBI and claimed our bank to cancel the transaction at same time. But the only thing we received from Wells Fargo was an answer that we should deal directly with a company who cheated us, knowing perfectly that we got a victim of internet crime and would not obtain any answer back from the company which cheated us, once they got funds.

The person requested that the money be sent through XXXX, which is included as an online service through my bank, Wells Fargo. I sent the money and never received the tickets. The other party stopped responding to my attempts to contact them. I immediately contacted XXXX, but was told I needed to contact Wells. Wells told me that they could not stop or reverse the transaction, but they would open a fraud case. I asked if I should contact my local PD and was told it was not necessary. The Wells Fargo representative told me that the Fraud department would first need to determine that there was fraud involved, and that the other party did not suffer some sort of event like an accident that prevented them from completing the transaction. Once they have determined that it was fraud they would open a full investigation and would be contacting me for more information. The fraud department denied any restitution. I spoke to Wells customer service on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that the extend of the investigation is only to make sure that the money was sent to the appropriate account. No other steps were taken and I still see advertisements on XXXX all the time from the fraudulent party. Wells will not do any further investigation and XXXX will not work with me either. I had never used XXXX and was under the impression that they would offer consumer protection similar to other person to person money transfer services. I further expected that Wells would offer me protection and follow through on taking the steps they told me they would."
150,Wells Fargo bank is allowing scam & fraud business to create account impersonating as other businesses. We placed an order with a company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. So they sent us an invoice with wire transfer details. We did our due diligence to verify the company certificate of formation and XXXX XXXX number. And we also checked with Wells Fargo to ensure no individual can impersonate as a business to open a fraud account. Wells Fargo assured us that its not easy to open a XXXX account without proper verification. So then we made a wire payment to this company. Since we didn't receive our goods that we ordered and this company started demanding more money for Shipment insurance we got suspicious. So then we contacted the registered agent of this company. She and her husband confirmed that the company is valid but they do not have account in Wells Fargo and they do not sell these products. So our concern is how can Wells Fargo operations be so lousy to allow people to create a business account even though they are not associated with the business. And this allows this scammer to operate without any issues. This needs to be rectified to prevent more people & businesses from getting scammed. The scam business is impersonating XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They are operating under the website XXXX and have business account in Wells Fargo. These accounts do not belong to real XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or its owners.
151,"I was in the process of buying a new home and the lender ( XXXX XXXX ) requested statements from my closed XXXX account. In an effort to do so, on XX/XX/20, I called a number I found online claiming to be XXXXXXXX XXXX customer service and that's when my issues began. I spoke with a XXXX XXXX at XXXX ( I have several text messages to support this ). In a well engineered process, they asked me to log into my bank account to verify my identify and conduct a series of test transactions to increase my daily limit as well as install an app to read my screen to better assist me. I felt uneasy about it but my back was against the wall as the lender ( XXXX XXXX ) wasn't going clear me to close on my new house ... so I followed suit against my better judgement. We did three transactions, to which the money was instantly credited back to my account ( they did this to gain my trust ), then they asked me to do the final test to be able to access my statements, the last test was a wire transfer to one of their managers XXXX XXXX which will not come from my account, so when I did that, the money left my account and all of sudden they started having technical issues and wasn't able to reversed the funds. I was placed on hold and was desperate to get my money back because it was a part of my down payment. I contacted my bank Wells Fargo and they told me because I authorized the transfer they could not reimburse me. So I called XXXX XXXX  to see if I could resolve this directly with the receiving bank and they told me they couldn't access this XXXX XXXX account because I was not the owner and they could get into trouble for doing so and advised me to work with my bank 's ( Wells Fargo ) wire department, which I did. Today, I received Wells Fargo final decision not to reimburse me for the money I transferred. As of last Friday, XX/XX/20 my account was under attack, someone tried to make a purchase using the new debit card the bank issued as part of the XX/XX/20 issue. My second replacement card is on the way. I need help resolving this with Wells Fargo or XXXX XXXX I would like them to at least try to get my money back from an account belonging to scammer XXXX XXXX from Pennsylvania."
152,"On XX/XX/2019 I made a XXXX transaction through my Wells Fargo account in the amount of {$450.00} to XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX as a deposit on an item for sale posted on an account I follow on XXXX. 
On XX/XX/2019 I made a second transaction in the amount of {$700.00} to the same individual that was to be my final payment. 
Later, the seller claimed she did not receive the {$700.00}, so I made a claim through Wells Fargo that the funds were not received. Shortly afterwards, I was made aware that the seller was stealing photos of items from a legitimate business and posting them for sale, when in fact, she did not have those items to sell. After some research, I discovered the seller has done this to multiple people ; posting items for sale, receiving payment for those items through XXXX and disappearing. 
Once I learned I was being scammed I contacted Wells Fargo to cancel the claim in progress and instead file a money movement claim that I did not receive the goods/services I had paid for. 
Wells Fargo opened two claims, one for each transaction and reached the conclusion that because I made the transactions and since they were already completed, they would not offer any recourse or refund. They recommended I contact XXXX and continue the matter with them, which I did and had a manager explain to me that a XXXX payment should be treated like a cash transaction and that once completed, could not be reversed and they refused to offer a refund. 
Only after I asked if they were interested in knowing someone was using their platform for scams did they ask me for information on who the seller was."
156,"XX/XX/XXXX - I begin XXXX transfers ( {$100.00} & {$2500.00} ) from my Wells Fargo savings account to my new XXXX XXXX savings account. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I close all Wells Fargo accounts. 
XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX XXXX reverses the funds because they can not accept the transfers from a closed account. 

I can still see transaction history in my Wells Fargo savings account because it is within XXXX of account closure. The history of the transaction was present at one point but it is no longer there, a representative on the phone stated, "" the transaction could have fell off because it wasn't completed ''. Wells Fargo states they can not issue a refund/cashier 's check because they can't see the money. This is also why they can't find an ACH/trace ID number. 

On XXXX XXXX 's transaction history it shows my account receiving the transfer from said Wells Fargo account and reversing it as well."
158,"My name is XXXX XXXX. I have an existing complaint against Wells Fargo Bank. Well Fargo allowed another person to open accounts, recieve debit cards, checks, change my account information. All this was done during an investigation of fraud I made on my accounts. 
Wells Fargo initially told me, law enforcement, experian, and the XXXX I stole my own money and they investigated this several times and I did this. I reported Wells Fargo to the Executive office of Complaints who also claimed there was no fraud and I stole my own money. I then reported them to your office. Low and behold they have now sent me a letter telling me the accounts are not mine and I did not open them. Wells Fargo is only paying me for what they allowed to happen the month of XX/XX/2020. I called and asked them about the remainder of the missing money, fraud. Transfers and why they will not cooperate with law enforcement. 
Wells Fargo is claiming I have to file a new claim for the rest of the fraud. I submitted this all to Wells Fargo from the beginning. Why are they picking and chosing what they get to claim as fraud. I am still out over XXXX XXXX dollars. I still have the person in my accounts. Wells Fargo gave this person and still is my information. They only gave me a portion of my money back because I reported them to this office. 
Wells Fargo is the most dishonest bank. This person has stolen my life. I am XXXX. So thats why I dont get my money? 
I have begged Wells Fargo to talked to my investigating officer. I have tracked the person who I think it is. He can not do anything without their help. 
They tell me they don't do investigations. This is never going to end if the person is not caught. I cant even open a bank account. I want my money. I live XXXX check to XXXX check. We can't run our buisness and they are still refusing to help me. I dont understand Wells Fargo is breaking the law as bad as the person who has my identity. They have and are stealing blind from me. They are continuing to let my identity be stolen. I truly believe this is an inside job. Wells Fargo purposly has given out my information and they will continue to do so. I cant stop them. 
Please help me. My investigation officer is XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX County Wisconsin Sheriffs Dept. XXXX XXXX XXXX. I cant afford Wells Fargo I cant afford to hire an attorney. This is completely wrong. NOONE from Wells Fargo will help me. I just keep finding more and more money missing and more and more accounts open. When I call them. They won't tell me anything.

We submitted an affidavit of forgery to Wells Fargo bank, through XXXX XXXX. on XX/XX/2022. That same day, we got an email with a new affidavit of forgery for XXXX XXXX  and we were informed that was the insurance company 's bank. So, we did the new form, submitted everything that day.

165,"I ordered XXXX cashiers checks on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. Despite using my account login, filling out all relevant information as required, and requesting my checks be delivered to the same address that is on file as my primary residence with Wells Fargo, the bank required more information by phone call ; this seems to be a standard practice, Wells Fargo does not mention it as a required step on the process. 

After speaking with a Wells Fargo representative on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I resubmitted my request for the XXXX checks. On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I received XXXX emails each asking me to call to provide additional information and providing a phone number and ordeXXXX XXXX  I called, provided the additional information ( that it was actually me who requested the checks ) and was told the checks had been processed. I received no notification via email as Wells Fargo says I would. After no notification from Wells Fargo and with the relevant funds still being in my account rather than being withdrawn by Wells Fargo to cover the checks, I called Wells Fargo back via the number provided by email to ask what was going on. I was told the checks had been not been processed. Additionally, despite calling at approximate XXXX XXXX  on a Wednesday ( within normal business hours for Wells Fargo XXXX the United States XXXX XXXX XXXX all those who would be able to process my checks had left for the day, extending the issue at minimum XXXX additional business day. The payment theses checks are for will now be at least 11 days late. 

Wells Fargo is not clear about its process, and has made numerous additional errors during processing to exacerbate the issue. XXXX business days after I first requested the cashier checks, the issue is not resolved."
167,"On XXXX I was scammed over the phone and I let someone go into my account to add back the amount they were saying they took out of my account. In turn they took over my work computer. They encouraged me to get a cashier 's check from my bank Wells Fargo and deposit it to an account at XXXX  XXXX XXXX which I did, however I was told from XXXX that the funds would be put on a hold until XX/XX/XXXX because it was a brand new account. The next morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ) at XXXX XXXX  we were at Wells Fargo on XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, NC XXXX to change all of our accounts and report the scam. We also had a police report done that day and and FBI report on XXXX. We talked to the XXXX XXXX and a customer service lady by the name of XXXX ( who was the one who helped out switch all of our accounts ), and let them know there was suspicious activity and asked them to help put a stop payment on the cashier 's check. XXXX also called the fraud department and filed a second claim, because they couldn't find my original one that I had reported earlier that morning. We were told by the branch manager they would look into it and get back to me but it may take some time. I also made sure to let everyone that I talked to know that the funds were on a hold until XX/XX/XXXX, so time was of the essence. 

The branch XXXX was of no help at all, she just listened to my story of what happened and basically told me there was nothing they could do, considering I got the cashier 's check and it was up to the fraud departments of WF and XXXX  to hash it out ( I had already filed a complaint with XXXX on the same morning ), and shrugged her shoulders. Unfortunately I heard nothing from Wells Fargo and each day I called I was told they couldn't find either claim ( the one I put in or the one XXXX put in ). I called everyday for a long time even after the hold date on the account because I was assured by BOA the account had been frozen due to the fact I had reported suspicious activity, so at that time I felt like we had time to let the banks get this worked out and eventually I would receive the {$49000.00} back. Finally on XXXX I got ahold of someone who told me that my information needed to have been sent to the escalations department from the beginning, which was the first time I ever heard there was an escalations department, otherwise I would have started there, one of my questions is why didn't the bank manager handle that for us on XX/XX/XXXX, why didn't any one in the claims department tell me or XXXX on XXXX we needed to be dealing with the escalations department?? All this time went by and this was never mentioned, and like I said everyone knew time was of the essence! I got a hold of escalations on XX/XX/XXXX and filed a claim with them. Finally on XX/XX/XXXX I got ahold of a lady named XXXX from escalations who said they were still working on the case but there was nothing to report yet, and on XX/XX/XXXX I was called and was told they were extending my case and reaching out to high chains of command and would get back to me. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from XXXX from the escalations department at Wells Fargo, telling me they finally contacted XXXX and was told that the funds had been wired out to the person that had scammed me and that there was nothing they could do, the funds were gone! Why didn't Wells Fargo escalate my issue on the day it was reported? We had time to get the funds back if they would have acted quickly on my behalf? I have been a member of Wells Fargo Bank for over 20 years, this is beyond absurd, XXXX had the funds on hold and no one did anything, even though EVERYONE knew I had been scammed, you basically just let the scammers win! I would like answers as to why no one took this seriously, or at least lead me to the correct places ( escalations ) where you/me could have gotten this resolved in a timely manner and had a chance to get my family 's savings back! We had 4 business days to do something knowing the my {$49000.00} was sitting in an account that was on HOLD, and you opened and closed my the investigation on the same day it was reported!!

Also how can Wells Fargo have opened and closed my first complaint on XX/XX/XXXX on the same day and never let me know until XX/XX/XXXX, when I had been calling daily and getting passed through your customer service like a hot potato and never getting any answers, this is just not right in so many ways! Please let me remind you, that XXXX claims were reported on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX by me and one by the customer service lady ( XXXX ) at the XXXX branch, while we were sitting there with her at XXXX!

Wells fargo as an obligation of result, Wells Fargo accepted a transaction and charged fees for it. My funds have disappeared, this is fraud, robbery and criminal.

It seems that very little effort has been initiated to resolve this major problem.

Wells Fargo has banking relationships with international banks as an international bank it self, the treatment of this situation is the poorest I have ever encountered in 20 years of international business not to mention the shocking level of incompetence of Wells Fargo agents. It is also to be noted that this is not the first time i have wired funds to that particular account to that particular vendor and never encountered any issues. SHOCKING"

I ask them to freeze the account so we could get our money back. They stated they couldn't do that. Well Fargo is being used as a money laundering bank for these criminals.

On XX/XX/2022 my son initiated a wire transfer from his personal account Using the very same information that was given to Wells Fargo and the transfer went through the very same day. I feel that Wells Fargo has try to resolve this matter in bad faith and being disingenuous with the information that they provided it offered a quick cashier 's check just to end the problem. The problem still exists the cashier is worthless and we need to have the money wired to the account that was provided to them."

2nd payment to 2nd scammer was {$300.00} ( for two tickets ). I have a phone number, email address, and Driver 's License.

Wells Fargo uses XXXX   so I thought I was protected and this was a trusted platform. Unfortunately I didn't receive any tickets from both scammers and Wells Fargo refused to help but recommended that I file a police report, which I did and I have the case number. I also emailed XXXX support but I don't expect to get any help from them based on what I was reading. I also filed a complaint with XXXX.

Can I be advised on what consumer protection I have in regards to this matter?"

200,"On XX/XX/2022, I initiated a wire transfer from Wells Fargo 's official website to a XXXX account. According to the confirmation note I got from Wells Fargo, the money should be sent on XX/XX/2022, and be delivered to the recipient on XX/XX/XXXX. The amount I transferred was {$11000.00}, wire transfer fee was {$45.00}, tax was {$3.00}, and the total USD taken from my account was {$11000.00}. The money was transferred in USD, so no currency exchange was involved. 
However, the recipient hasn't got the money until XX/XX/XXXX, so I called Wells Fargo 's costumer service to ask about this situation. I was told that the money should have been on the recipiant 's account according to Wells Fargo 's record. I was provided a confirmation number which is said to be given by the recipient 's bank when they received the money. Given this confirmation number, the recipient checked with their bank, only to be told that their bank did not provide the number nor did they receive the money. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the customer services again and was told that the regular customer service could not solve the problem related to wire transfer so my request would be transferred to the special team for wire transfer and I should be replied within 10 business days through my Wells Fargo online account message center or my email address. I was also given a ticket number regarding this call.

10 business days later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I still didn't hear anything from Wells Fargo ( neither message center nor email ) regarding this wire transfer, and the recipient didn't get the money. So I called the third time to the customer service only to be told to call back at the regular working hour when the wire transfer special team works. 
I don't want to call them unless it's absolutely necessary, because a ) they should have solved my problem because it has been so long, b ) waiting on the line is so time consuming, and c ) I have to pay the bill for calling."
201,"I am in process of purchasing house, currently under contract and was planned for closing on XX/XX/XXXX. I was estimating approximately XXXX to XXXX USD in closing amount that was supposed to be due on closing day.

I completed the wire with amount of {$93000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and called my title company to confirm if they received the amount, only to figure out it was a scam. I have submitted fraud inquiry with both my bank XXXX and recipient 's bank Wells Fargo and it is under process but have not received back my funds yet. 

Upon contacting my bank XXXX, they state they have requested wire return request to Wells Fargo and we have to wait for them to return wire. Upon contacting Wells Fargo, they suggest I report to proper law agency for them to process the return of wire, which I have completed by reporting to IC3, but still have not received any reply on return of the funds."
202,"On XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX, I was contacted by an entity claiming to be the Wells Fargo XXXX prevention department XXXX The number calling me was the number I had recognized as Wells Fargo 's fraud prevention line ( they had called me a few weeks earlier to report a fraudulent charge on my account, so I was already familiar with the process ). After going through a process to confirm my identity ( e.g., asking me to confirm my address ) that was familiar to me because I had just gone through it with the real XXXX XXXX department just a few weeks prior, the person calling said that an individual had initiated a deduction of XXXX dollars via XXXX from my account to an account in Florida affiliated with XXXX XXXX and they had flagged the deduction as fraud and wanted to confirm. I said that I had not authorized this deduction. The man on the phone said that because the transaction had already initiated, the deduction was already pending, but he could reverse the transaction via XXXX by setting up a temporary account with an employee at XXXXXXXX XXXX. He led me through a series of steps which included me having to read a code texted to me, which I now recognize was me granting them access to my account via XXXX. They then directed me to make a series of XXXX XXXX payments to an account that had my name on XXXX, explaining that this was XXXXXXXX XXXX  crediting the money back to my account. I noticed that with each payment, my balance was getting lower, and just prior to the third deposit, I informed the man on the line that the third payment would overdraft my account, and I was confused. The man then hung up on me. 

Immediately after, I called Wells Fargo 's fraud department, where the woman on the line informed me that I had been in communication with fraudsters. I explained the above situation to her, and she opened up XXXX different cases ( XXXX for each transaction ). These case numbers were XXXX and XXXX. She informed me that if the case was not resolved within 7-10 business days, they would provide me with a temporary credit to my account. She confirmed that this date would be XX/XX/XXXX. 

Wells Fargo then sent me a letter in the mail ( dated XXXX ) informing me that they had closed the case and passed the matter onto XXXX, and said that XXXX would have to determine whether my lost funds could be returned to me. I followed up with them via phone ( today, XX/XX/XXXX ), where their fraud department repeated the above to me. They said they were no longer responsible for case, and that it was unlikely that I would see my money returned to me. I read them the following language from Regulation E word for word : "" Regulation E defines an unauthorized EFT as an EFT from a consumers account initiated by a person other than the consumer without actual authority to initiate the transfer and from which the consumer receives no benefit ... An unauthorized EFT includes a transfer initiated by a person who obtained the access device from the consumer through fraud or robbery. Similarly, when a consumer is fraudulently induced into sharing account access information with a third party, and a third party uses that information to make an EFT from the consumers account, the transfer is an unauthorized EFT under Regulation EXXXX For example, the Bureau is aware of the following situations where a third party has fraudulently obtained a consumers account access information, and thus, are considered unauthorized EFTs under Regulation E : ( 1 ) a third-party calling the consumer and pretending to be a representative from the consumers financial institution and then tricking the consumer into providing their account login information, texted account confirmation code, debit card number, or other information that could be used to initiate an EFT out of the consumers account, and ( 2 ) a third party using phishing or other methods to gain access to a consumers computer and observe the consumer entering account login information. EFTs stemming from these situations meet the Regulation E definition of unauthorized EFTs. '' I explained that the first example given was exactly what had happened to me per the notes that he had just read on my case, and he repeated again that Regulation E does not apply to my case. I informed the associate on the phone that I would be filing a complaint with the CFPB, because I was legally entitled to the funds being returned to my account, and ended the call. 

By my estimation, Wells Fargo has not only failed to properly correct what is plainly an unauthorized EFT by the definition set forth by the CFPB, but they also failed to follow the proper timeline for resolution, which according to 12 CFR 1005.11 ( c ) ( 1 ) should have been within one business day ( and therefore, XX/XX/XXXX at the latest ). In fact, when I initially reported the situation the evening of XX/XX/XXXX, the associate on the phone advised me that resolution might be a little slower "" because it is a holiday weekend. '' XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX are not federal holidays, so I don't see how that should have impacted the timeline."

I was asked to send a copy of the receipt to my new employer. Since the funds were available on the XXXX, that same day, I was asked to go to the store to buy supplies. Things became too strange and I texted my employer to explain why I was uncomfortable. Since I no longer wanted to go forward with the situation/job, I did not want to keep the money sent to me by check ( {$3200.00} ) and it was suggested that I return the funds using Bitcoins, I didn't want to do that, then XXXX was suggested and I did the transfer using XXXX that same day. The following day, my bank informed me that the check was fraudulent and I transferred my own money to crooks.

The scammer then told me to get my money back I had to make the same XXXX  transfers to a XXXX acct. I had no reason to believe it was not wells fargo and it seems more and more of Wells Fargo customers are being scammed the same way. Wells Fargo had no information on their site until a week ago telling its customer the scam has been going on but Wells Fargo has known this issue has been going on for over a year. They also knew that my acct information was hacked thru their servers and they will not refund XXXX dollars I was scammed. This plain wrong and Wells Fargo is trying to get out of this issue like they have with other scam issues in the past. They knew this was going on with plenty of customer and that someone was spoofing their number to talk to their customers but seem to take no responsibilty in there neglegance. I filed thru XXXX  and its seems they are finally tryin to alert their customer but the damage has been done. It seems the media is getting ahold of this from other customers who have been scammer. Wells Fargo needs to do the right thing and I will sue if refund is not given and there is many of us that have been hurt by Wells Fargo lack of security then step back and say it wasnt us but it truly is they need to alert customers when there information has been stolen from either employees or scammers. Below is a link of the same exact thing happening to another women and again Wells Fargo blames its customers when this clearly is wrong doing by Wells Fargo. I ask for a refund and apology letter from XXXX XXXX staff on how Wells Fargo should have done more instead of point the finger.

211,"On XXXX XXXX, 2021 an international money wire was initiated by our XXXX XXXX XXXX ' family from XXXX, XXXX in the amount of {$200000.00} ( USD ). This wire goes through Wells Fargo as the intermediary bank prior to be released to my personal bank, XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. 

The wire was never received into my account so I talked to my bank beginning on XX/XX/XXXX to investigate and then spoke to a manager at a local Wells Fargo branch to see what we can do. Both have said on this visit and numerous visits and conversations with management since that there is nothing they can do. The XXXX XXXX  initiated a wire trace and confirmed with us on XXXX XXXX that the wire had been received by Wells Fargo Bank in XXXX XXXX. This money has still never been released to my account with XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX  5 weeks later. 

The bank in XXXX has provided numerous documentation of the wire confirmation, communications they have sent via XXXX to Wells Fargo to cancel the wire since the money is not being released, etc. with no success. 

I have talked with executives at XXXX XXXX  which say there is nothing they can do and when they send a XXXX message to Wells Fargo they say nothing is pending.

I have also been victimized to a recent cybercrime incident that I wanted the bank to be aware of since I withdrew my funds from this particular branch. When the banker sat me down, I had asked what XXXX protocols on customers who pull out large amounts of cash. She said as long as we ID you, you are able to withdraw any amount you wish. I then told her of my incident on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I came into the branch that day and asked the teller to withdraw XXXX from my savings account. I was being held XXXX on the phone with scammers. These criminals had put malware on my laptop, blocked my XXXX protection and put XXXX  XXXX on my device. They said there was an authorized pending XXXX charge to XXXX that was getting ready to hit my account. They said the only way to save this transaction from happening was to create a duplicate charge via digital currency. These scammers had actually called the XXXX XXXX # so I had thought I was talking to a XXXX Fraud agent, but it was another scammer in the group. Back to my visit on the XXXX, my purpose there was to wire my money to another bank and to tell them about the XX/XX/XXXX incident including how these scammers really call the XXXX XXXX # as a part of their scam to make it all more credible. When I told the banker what happened, she went and got the Branch Manager. Branch Manager comes over and I asked the same question about what procedures does Wells Fargo have when large cash withdrawals are made. She said the same as the banker. I then begin to tell her my cybercrime incident. She starts to ask if I called the police yet. I told her it's been 6 weeks since it occurred, I've notified multipole law enforcement agencies. I just now had the courage to come back into this branch and tell my story. She defends by telling me her tellers did nothing wrong and that large cash withdrawals happen all the time in XXXX, AZ. I replied, so are people withdrawing XXXX all the time here and he reply was yes. I had attempted to tell her how these scammers call the XXXX # and how it's a part of their script. She continued to defend her store and how no one did anything wrong. I asked why no one offered to sit me down or offer a cashier 's check instead of cash ( the tellers asked what I was buying, and I had said a car ). Unfortunately, she emotionally triggered me, and I was crying hysterically. I couldn't talk to her anymore and asked her to leave me with the banker. My banker said she now understood why I asked about their protocols and gave me her XXXX box. The banker completed out my wire transfer. She was very empathic and kind. She was the only pleasant part of this experience. I did find out a few days later that my banker opened a compliant incident on my behalf to Wells Fargo. I currently have a case open with them."

The invoices came with a notification that payments should now go to a different Wells Fargo Account. Same name / different account number. I bank with Wells Fargo, my landlord banks with Wells Fargo, the email came from his email address. Seemed legit, so I transferred the money. 

The next day, I asked my landlord if he received the funds. He said, No. I showed him our email correspondence over the past week. He acknowledged that the emails were not written or sent by him. He did find that someone hacked into his server and the new Wells Fargo account was not his. 

I notified Wells Fargo Bank at the beginning of XXXX immediately after the scam. Ive called Wells Fargo several times for a resolution without success. I have not received a single initiated correspondence from Wells Fargo. Looking for a resolution and for Wells Fargo to act as time is a factor."

The car was located in XXXX XXXX and I flew up there ( one way ticket ) on XX/XX/XXXX. When I arrived the car dealer told me that they couldn't accept the check because my check wasn't signed by Wells Fargo. I spent 5 hours on the phone that day with customer service at Wells Fargo and they told me that the choices I had were XXXX XXXX XXXX hours to the nearest branch ( XXXX ) or fly home and get my local branch to sign it. I elevated my call to a complaint department. I also spent 2 hours calling the XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo branch and nobody answered. It was because they were short staffed. So I was left in XXXX XXXX, with no place to stay, no car and no way to address the problem that Wells Fargo caused by not signing the check. I got a hotel room in the nearest town ( XXXXXXXX XXXX ) and in the evening I called my XXXX banker and they prepared to wire the money to the car dealer the next day using a margin loan. The cost for the wire and margin interest was {$35.00} and {$230.00}. The wire finally hit the dealer account on XX/XX/XXXX and I left the dealer on XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX XXXX. I drove as far as I could and ended up staying in XXXXXXXX XXXX so I could get some sleep and finish my drive the next day. I went into the Wells Fargo branch as soon as I could ( the following Tuesday morning ) and I gave them back the cashier 's check and they credited my account. I then transferred the money from my Wells Fargo account to my XXXX account to repay the margin loan. The process took a few days and completed on XX/XX/XXXX and the amount that was transferred back to XXXX was {$54000.00} to cover the wire transfer fees and I since I didn't know what my final interest amount would be I covered that in my XXXX account separately rather than my Wells Fargo account. I filed a request with the branch manager ( XXXX XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo to be reimbursed for all of my expenses I took on to remedy the problem they created by not signing my cashier 's check. Simultaneously I received an email from the Wells Fargo resolution team from XXXX XXXX ( Phone XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) and her contact info she sent me was incorrect. I never heard back from XXXX or from XXXX so I contacted XXXX today and resubmitted my total expenses to be reimbursed for their mistake and informed her that XXXX told me he would submit the request and that it was internal decision on whether it would be his branch reimbursing me or a different department but that either way I would be reimbursed. Since it has been 3 weeks since this happened and over 2 weeks since I requested being reimbursed I am submitting my complaint here because it appears nobody at Wells Fargo is owning this problem."

It appeared deposited in my bank account when these same people told me that I had to send them part of the check. The same bank called me and told me that what was happening with my account was a fraud that did not send more money, when I had already sent {$1000.00} dollars. This morning, XX/XX/XXXX, I wake up with the fact that I have the account at- {$960.00} because the bank canceled those checks after days. I called the bank and they told me that they could not return my money, that the return of my money had to do with the other bank and not with them and that they most likely will not return anything to me, despite the fact that they themselves gave account that it was I was the victim of a fraud"
236,"I was given a job offer. ( I will attach ) I accepted the job offer and worked for this individual for 1 month. 
I was sent a check for {$4900.00}. I called Wells Fargo after I mobile deposited my check to say that it didn't look right and I thought it was a scam. XXXX This is all on a recorded line ). 
When I called Wells fargo to cancel the check, they stated they couldn't cancel ( even though I said it could potentially be fraud ) and they had approved of it the next day. 
During that time, that individual that I worked for hacked my information and sent money through the XXXX.I woke up to {$0.00} in my checking and savings AND my credit card was at it's full max. I called Wells Fargo to let them know that I did not authorize these transactions but they indicated that I did. I have the police involved as I was threatened and the individual ended up coming to my house saying that if I did not tell the bank I authorized them, than they would come after me. 
I had to Wells Fargo they were sent but only for a job ( that was part of my responsibility for that individual. ) I I also contacted XXXX and they stated there was nothing they could do. 
The {$4900.00} check AFTER I called Wells Fargo to let them know it could be potentially fraud, got reversed. 
I called Wells Fargo to submit a claim and they indicated they can no longer help me after several attempts to get it reconsidered. I even talked to the corporate office and they said that they should be able to look into it and they never did. 
They sent me multiple letters. 
The CC departments said I will get my reimbursement back. They gave it to me, then took it out of my account the next day. 
They sent me a letter stating that I would get {$2000.00} back and then the next day said I couldn't get it again. 
Wells Fargo treated me terribly and they have XXXX for when people get scammed. 
I filed a complaint through Wells Fargo and they never got back to me. 
It's very confusing when I have been a member since XXXX and they should be able to protect their customers. 
Now I am out of {$4900.00} and tried very hard to let them know that it was an incident involving myself bring threatened and that when I tried to call back ( even the police officer told me to call them with the police report ) to say that I was threatened and since I told them I sent money for donations they declined and treated me TERRIBLY. 
They told me to stop calling and CONTINUOUSLY send me letters saying they will refund me and than they don't. 
All of this should be on a recorded line with them. 
1. ) - I asked to cancel a check due to suspicious activity and they did NOTHING. Not even close my account! I had to call them back to let them know that I was scammed and they did NOTHING.

2. ) They told me that they were here to help and that is not the case. I got told I would get a credit on my CREDIT CARD ( which they processed on XX/XX/XXXX and then took it out of my account again ) - THIS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES. It was not stated it was a ( temporary credit ), they gave it to me. When I called, they transferred me multiple times and when I got to the fraud department, they said that there was nothing they could do. 
3. ) When I called a second time to let them know what had really happened with myself being in danger, they offered to get it reconsidered and I was on hold for them to tell me "" There is nothing we can do. '' and that was it. Nothing else.

4. ) They sent me a letter stating that I was able to get {$2000.00} back on my card and then when I called them to say that I don't see a credit and how can you approve of it and then cancel? Again, there was no temporary credit given. It was given to me by them from their claims department. When I called back they stated that "" sorry for the miscommunication. '' They didn't protect me in any way/shape or form. I have been on the phone with them for hours and hours and no one has helped me at all. They won't understand my life was in danger and that I did NOT authorize these transactions. This would not have happened if they would have cancelled that check. 
I was scammed out of {$4900.00}. I have not received any money back from Wells Fargo OR a follow up on my complaint."
237,"Unfortunately I was a victim of fraud/scam action. My friend XXXX recommended me his mentor on XX/XX/22 we started having this conversation over XXXX XXXX about how he raised XXXX from investing XXXX into one of recommended platforms ( XXXX probably ). The XXXX account nicknames of him is XXXX  and his mentor who I sent money to is XXXX Since XXXX is my good friend, I believed him and sent his mentor an amount of XXXX through XXXX  which he put on XXXX website. Based on website I got XXXX usd raised in as little as 2 hours immediately. The platform asked me to upgrade to another level with a XXXX  of XXXX to my mentor, which I transferred again. Then, I got XXXX usd raised immediately again. Afterwards, they asked for a 5 % commission fee which I was supposed to send XXXX to the mentor fraud. Eventually wells fargo blocked my account since I exceeded the limit and only after that I realized he is a fraud/scam. I filed a complaint about my lost XXXX usd to wells fargo and could not file another one for my XXXX account in the maount of XXXX usd."
238,"We are a XXXX based company. On XXXX XXXX, 2020, we made a wire transfer to our US based partner company for payment of an invoice. Their bank is Wells Fargo. The wire transfer was sent and on XXXX XXXX, 2020, we were advised that our partner did not receive the funds. We realized the account number was incorrect on the wire transfer, so we immediately went to our bank, XXXX, and advised them. They immediately put a stop on the transaction even though it was several weeks later. In looking at the wire transfer information, the account number did not match the payee company information. When this information does not match, the policy of all receiving banks is to hold and return the funds to the originating bank and a new corrected wire transfer submitted. All details on cheques, drafts, money orders, wire transfers, etc. must be accurate and match before a deposit can be completed. In the past, we have had payments to US based suppliers and payments from US based customers held and returned due to inaccurate information on bank drafts and wire transfers. This causes delays and is inconvenient but necessary and understandable to maintain the integrity of the international banking systems. 

I contacted Wells Fargo to talk to them and was advised that they could not speak with me because I was not their client. I asked my partner company that was the client, to speak with Wells Fargo, and they were advised they could not speak with them either and Wells Fargo would only speak with the originating bank ( XXXX ). We spoke with our bank, XXXX, and they have been trying to get the money returned to our account but Wells Fargo are not co-operating. We believe the money was deposited to the erroneous account which is against bank policies and Wells Fargo is trying to hide their negligence. The amount is {$79000.00}. This is a large amount and an international transfer over {$10000.00} in value. We were under the impression that all amounts over {$10000.00} entering the US were required to be scrutinized for fraud and to prevent money laundering. These simple bank procedures were either not performed by Wells Fargo and our money has not been returned to XXXX for us to send a corrected wire transfer."
240,"Hello, I got asked to create a song. They offered to pay me XXXX but sent XXXX on "" Accident ''. 

I deposited the check into my wellsfargo account the XXXX of XX/XX/2021. 
The check cleared and was in my account, so I sent them 4 payments of XXXX, only to have that check bounce 3 days later. I wouldnt sent them any money if the check wouldn't of cleared. I didn't get any notifications that it could be a fake check. I didn't have any pendings over the check it was all in my account. 

The account the contacted me was through XXXX, this is the account. XXXX The email address the check came from is XXXX Hope this information helps!"
243,Today I sent money to a person who used XXXX for tickets to a football game. Found out the game was not goin to have fans after I purchased what was suppose to be tickets. I paid XXXX dollars using XXXX with Wells Fargo. After contacting the seller several times with no response. I made a call to Wells Fargo. They said since I had sent the money. I had given permission and there was nothing they can do.
247,Used XXXX to transfer funds from Wells Fargo bank account to another Wells Fargo account to pay rent on XX/XX/2019 for {$500.00}. The person I was transferring funds to did not receive funds. Contacted Wells Fargo and filed complaint. They informed me that they could not help me and closed complaint because XXXX is not affiliated with them. They do advertise and encourage it on their website to pay bills with. Disappointed that they would not assist in getting funds back.
251,"On XX/XX/2022 I went inside XXXX XXXX branch located in XXXX, Ga to do 2 wire transfers in the amount of {$30000.00} and {$40000.00} dollars. I had a mortgage closing on XX/XX/2022 at XXXX. So on XX/XX/2022 I called Wells Fargo corporate department customer service and executive dept. they stated they could not help and directed me to the branch. As I went to the branch I spoke to the manager XXXX XXXX, asking her what happened to my funds? She contacted Wells Fargo wire department. They told her there was compliance issue and needed more information as in date of birth and address. Wells Fargo did not contact me anything in regards to that until I had to go there myself to find out that information. The Wells Fargo branch manager told me that the wire should be there the next day. So the seller of the home alllowed me to postpone for a day only. So the closing was scheduled for the XXXX of XXXX. The next day and till this day no funds has been recieved. 

I have spoke to several people in Wells Fargo corporate office and the bank manager is ignoring me Ive sent several emails. All they are telling me is that they cant do nothing. 

Wells Fargo has my {$70000.00} I cant afford to pay rent, food, pay bills due to all the funds being taken by them. There telling me to wait another couple weeks. I lost money on the closing as well."
252,"On XX/XX/2022, I experienced a very unusual case of wire fraud through the Wells Fargo XXXX Banking platform. 

As I left a target store, I received a text from Wells Fargo asking me to verify a recent purchase. 
The text was not legitimate but at that point I had no idea. I responded with NO, since I did not make the purchase. 

I then called wells fargo and heard my current business checking balance through the automated system. It was {$4000.00} dollars short so I continued to hold for a banker. While I was on hold, a XXXX number kept calling me. I assumed it could be the bank so I answered. A man claimed to be from the Wells Fargo Fraud Dept and needed to confirm suspicious transactions. 

He asked me to confirm my identity by sending me a text message to my cell. This is something that wells fargo does do so I still did not think anything was suspicious. I gave him the XXXX digit code. He then proceeded to read off my recent transactions. Apparently at this point, the person I was speaking to had hacked into my online banking using my username and password which I NEVER gave him. He made a {$4000.00} transfer from my business checking to my business savings before I began speaking to him on the phone which is why my balance was incorrect and the scam was more believable. 

Since the person was inside of the Wells fargo online banking platform, he immediately changed my password, turned on the wire transfer feature, added himself as a recipient, then transferred my entire business savings balance to himself in under XXXX minutes. I realized what was happening because wells fargo sent me XXXX emails showing the changes being done in my account. There was a slight delay so by the time I saw the emails it was too late. 

The worst part of this scam was right before I realized what this person was doing he had me enter a code. I thought it was strange but he said it was a new security feature to link your cell phone to security updates. I entered the code ( # *XXX** # ) symbols and numbers then realized this person gained remote access to my cell phone. I hung up and tried signing on to my online banking but couldnt because my password was changed. My phone settings were different as well. 

I called Wells Fargo and reported the incident. I was on the phone with a person from the wire fraud dept for over an hour sharing the details. The person said that she would attempt to do a wire recall and fraud investigation. 

Once again, I never gave anyone my online banking user name or password. In fact, I dont even know my password since I have it saved in my XXXX XXXX chain. This must be an inside job of some sort since the perpetrator already had all of my information before I began speaking to him. Without my online banking information, this person would have never been able to complete a wire transfer. I dont know how the person could have obtained my info since I only sign on to my wells account from my computer at home and through the app on my phone and neither device had been stolen. I also had both my debit cards in my possession. 

When the perp gained remote access to my mobile device, all calls and text messages intended for me were being sent to him. XXXX of my clients happened to call and she ended up speaking to the scammer. He told her I was being held hostage and if she ever wanted to see me alive again, she would need to pay him money. My client panicked, hung up, then called the XXXX XXXX  XXXX. She reported the issue resulting in XXXX police officers doing a wellness check at my home. I have proof of this incident, police officer testimony, AND multiple witnesses. 

The worst part is that wells fargo never asked me for the police information. They never called to verify the wire was being done by me. I have never used the wire feature in the 10 years I have had my account. I have also never logged in from an unknown device located outside of where I currently live. I have never made a transfer to a domestic XXXX account and have NEVER added the recipient 's name to any other transfers. Basically, this entire situation should have been red flagged immediately since several things were very different compared to my usual banking habits. No one called me, no one verified the transfer. 

After 30 days of wells fargo pretending to investigate the transfer, they sent me a letter saying since my user name and password was used, I am liable for the funds. This is absolute rubbish!!!!! I have proof that I am a victim of fraud. I want my money back! This happened because of the banks platform being compromised and wells allowed this to occur without my approval. 

I have tried going into the bank to escalate the claim and speak to management. Each time I do this I am told someone from wells fargo will contact me. No one calls. No one is allowing me to appeal this issue. I have never been treated so poorly in my life. The total amount stolen was {$24000.00}. 

I need your help to try to get the funds reimbursed but at the very least, to tell others about this scam so they can protect themselves. Please help!!!!!

256,"Basically, Wells Fargo ( WF ) has taken our money ( almost {$5000.00} ) and is holding it hostage. Lets start from the beginning. Back in XXXX we linked a non-Wells Fargo account ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to our WF 's bank account. We followed the prompts WF required for the transfer. WF took the money out of our XXXX account then froze our WF account to investigate if this was a possible fraudulent transaction. We were in FL closing on a property at the time and XXXX was back in Nebraska. Once we returned to XXXX, we went to our XXXX XXXX, obtained the required documentation WF requested and went to a WF branch and provided it to them. We were required to show the funds were taken out of our XXXX account and that our XXXX account was legitimate. One we provided the documentation from XXXX in person to a WF branch, a banker at WF worked to unfreeze our WF account. Once it was unfroze, the funds never came. We called WF and they have officially lost our money. We have been assigned multiple people who will not answer our calls. They will assign us a WF employee who has 10 business days to investigate, if they can not find our money, we get assigned another employee who has an additional 10 business day to investigate and so on. They are now saying they have until XXXX to investigate. An employee from XXXX has cooperated fully and has provided WF will all documents which shows WF withdrew the money from our XXXX account. I am not sure how a bank during a pandemic can take OUR money and not give it back. WF is bouncing us around, assigning different employees to prolong returning our money. I am pretty confident if a customer was a day late on a bill or had an overdraft, WF would take minutes to tack on late/overdraft fees. How can they get away with this? How is this legal? In what scenario can a bank take OUR money and not give it back? Why won't they deposit our money into our account while they investigate? This is the absolute worst time they can have complete disregard for us. I understand they are a large company, but they should not be able to hold our money hostage and get away with it."
257,Ive already try to bring some understanding to the misleading Pharmice do you get your do you look like a bank that gives you the impression that theyre protecting your money at the same time they give you options of ways you can send money and I feel a deception because you think if youre working within the confinement I bet anything use fraudulent activity once the money leaves your account but in this case and XXXX will never receive and for this reason I can probably should account for that I wont purchase something from XXXX and XXXX could not get my money But while in the bank while with XXXX XXXX the subject came up about fraudulent activity that took place with XXXX and XXXX and I told to tell her that I could get my money back this was months later and they asked me if I could use my debit card they were able to give me my money back so why is Wells Fargo not being held with liable especially during this time where people are being laid off and money is important to XXXX the government is sending out trillions of dollars to help people this was my own money that I used and was taken why Is there not being more done this is a commonsense situation are use what was available through the bank via the bank with my bank card and the money was taken and not returned thank you XXXX XXXX XXXX please escalate this to another department that can handle this also I do have photographs of the texts and if needed the amount of two transfers and also the wire transfer with the routing number and account number at the bank house office if you need it please let me know because I dont know how to upload this with the system that Im on thank you.

I went right away to the bank to report it .closed the account and debit card. Re opened new account made a claim to bank for fraud and loss. XX/XX/XXXX they closed the claim saying it was authorized and no processing errors. I have been with this bank for over 30 years and they can see I have never done XXXX transfers from my account.

262,"Wells Fargo sends me monthly rent money from my trust. It is deposited on the XXXX of each month into my checking account for use the next month. This rent money is due on the first of each month, with a grace period of five days. They did not deposit my rent money this month ( XX/XX/2022 ). I called my XXXX  officer and she needs a budget form filled out and mailed back in order to continue my payments. This has always been done in XXXX or XXXX each year. This year the budget form was not sent to me and they continued depositing my rent into my checking account. I thought they finally realized that since it is just for my rent, a budget form was not necessary. I tried to tell her the money is needed now, but she just said she will send another form and then hung up on me. I do not want a XXXX officer who is rude and inconsiderate, but one who treats a client with respect and understands and listens. She is quite able to help and deposit my rent money while mailing out the budget form, but refused to even comprehend my stress and in the meantime, I still have no rent money for XXXX.

Unfortunately, it was not actually XXXX and the link ended up enabling the person ( s ) to send XXXX transfers from our checking account into their account. 

This occurred on XX/XX/2022 and we notified Wells Fargo immediately, prior to any fund transfers being completed. They didn't take any action to stop the transfer ( s ), which totaled {$2300.00}, the fund transfers ultimately went through, and Wells Fargo is refusing to reimburse us claiming that these transfers were "" authorized '' by my wife. They seemed to base this on her handling the link she received from what she thought was XXXX."
264,I dont agree with their decision and documents provided by them i lost money and didnt help me they are very cold
265,I was trying to purchase an exotic bird from a website. I made the purchase through XXXX and the business who was selling the bird. Didnt fulfill the purchase. I tried to reach out to Wells Fargo. Which is my bank. XXXX my transaction has the info of where the money went to and to whom it went to. I dont have that ability to see or dispute more than submitting a claim with my bank. They told me to wait 10 days. Which I did. And then when I called on the 11th day. They said the case was closed and they wouldnt give me the money back. If I didnt receive the good and Im claiming that the individual was committing fraud and grand theft. Then they should reach out to the receiving bank asking for my money. And they should take the money from this individual who had to have shownwd Identification to open up and account and negative balance his account. Or something needs to be done to fix the situation
266,I opened an account with Wells Fargo in XXXX Texas I then received a check from Wells Fargo bank and they deposited into my account knowingly that it was a scam and fraudulent however they charge my account took my direct deposit from my XXXX to pay that off and the check was from their company on one of their accounts and they fraudulently scan me out of money
268,"On XXXX, I received an email alledgedly from XXXX stating that a fradulent charge of {$2200.00} had been charged to my XXXX account and that if I wanted to dispute this charge, I should call the phone number listed in the email. Already under great financial stress, I took the phisher 's bait as I could not afford to lose any more money than I already had. The scammer explained that if I opened my online bank account, I could see that this money had been withdrawn from my account. I did so and did see that the money was being withdrawn. The scammer explained that he would place the money back in my account but that I had to enter the numbers "" {$2200.00} '' for this to occur. I did so. Imagine my surprise when my monitor screen showed that I had moved "" {$22000.00} '' back into my account, rather than "" {$2200.00} ''. 
At this point the scammer claimed that MY mistake ( which he had orchestrated from his computer ) would cost him his job at XXXX UNLESS I went in person to my bank ( Wells Fargo ) and wired the money directly into his account. Because I did not want him to lose his job and because I am an honest person and realized this money did not belong to me, I did go to my bank and make the transfer as instructed by him. 
Imagine my horror when I realized the next day that I was the victim of his manipulation, when he had convinced me that he was the victim here because of my mistake. 
I have no satisfaction either from Wells Fargo, my bank, or from the receiving bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX. You will find attached the original the scammer sent me, the wire transfer information the scammer gave me to complete the wire transfer, and a telephone chart of his phone calls to me.

271,"I contacted wells fargo to cancel a direct pay payment that had not been sent out yet. I spoke with a rep on a recorded line and she advised that she was able to cancel the payment. We had a several minute long recorded call. The next day I logged in & saw she canceled the wrong payment. I contacted the bank immediately and they saw the previous days reps notes and that she canceled the wrong payment. I was advised they were going to contact the other bank, have the payment reversed, and that I should see the deposit in a few business days. The refund did not arrive. I called a week later and was advised I need to file a claim and was given claim number XXXX.

I have yet to receive a call from anyone at Wells fargo. XXXX without any input from me or confirming the audio recording of the call with the initial rep ( to cancel the payment ) issued me a {$50.00} customer appreciation credit which was foisted upon me without acceptance ( directly deposited into my account ). As of todays call I was advised that XXXX was not at her desk and her supervisor was on a call and it might be better for me to resubmit the claim. The new claim reference number is XXXX. The switch board number I call XXXX. While the operators are very kind they are some of the slowest talkers I have ever spoken with and repeat & reiterate details ad nauseum. Reading details of the calls that I made and what transpired on each call ( which accomplished nothing ). Reading the denial letter that I holding. Honestly felt like an annoy tactic."
272,"I made a total of five wire transfers from my checking account at Wells Fargo on the following dates and amounts : XX/XX/2022 - {$5500.00} XX/XX/2022 - {$10000.00} XX/XX/2022 - {$16000.00} XX/XX/2022 - {$25000.00} XX/XX/2022 - {$3000.00} to a XXXX XXXX Bank located in the US and in each case Wells Fargo did not question my transactions as to the nature nor the potential of these transfers being a potential part of a scam to get my money in fraud transaction. 

All my money transferred has been stolen and now the scam company wants me to pay an additional {$13000.00} + for a debt that was not of my creation. 

Wells Fargo should have provided better customer protection, flagging the XXXX XXXX Bank as a player in scamming people and advising customers not to make the wire transfer."
273,"On XX/XX/XXXX I XXXX my babysitter her money. I hit her name and XXXX her {$200.00}. A day later she tells me she never received the money. I checked my bank records and it shows her name, XXXX. After going crazy for a few minutes trying to figure out why she never received the babysitting money, I realize I had sent it to the wrong XXXX. Apparently I had another XXXX in my recipients without even knowing. I contacted Wells Fargo right away to try to reverse the transactions and they quickly informed me it was irreversible transaction. I explained the situation to Wells Fargo, that I contacted the wrong person I send the money too and they themselves did not get the money either if not she would have return it to me. I then got the documents from XXXX XXXX inventigation and now it claims the money was sent to another phone number listed in the token/account. XXXX and all these big banks are a total scam. Wells Fargo said they would try to get my money back but they did not do the proper investigation. I am a single mother of XXXX kids. I need those {$200.00}. My next step is to open a police report. I though Wells fargo was going to do more for its customers especially because I have been a loyal longtime customer but they did not care. {$200.00} might not be alot for XXXX but to me and my family it is a whole week of food and gas. Also I do not understand why they did not keep on trying to collect the money from XXXXXXXX XXXX because that is where the money got sent to apparently. I am very disappointed with Wells Fargo. If this is not resolve I will never bank with them again, close all my accounts, let my family and friend about what they did and not to use their services ever again. Alot of my family memeber have account and auto loans with them. They are willing to close their accounts because their looking at how they are handling my situation and does not that to happen to them."
275,"Someone called on XX/XX/2021, and said that I had charges on my XXXX account and that they were going to set up security and make sure I got the money back. They took control of my computer which had my banking information on it. They went into my account and wired themselves {$3100.00} out of my checking account. Once I realized this had happened, I called Wells Fargo immediately and submitted a fraud complaint and was told they would work on it and it would be resolved as soon as possible. I received a letter from Wells Fargo saying that because they could not prove that I did not willingly allow the person to take the money, they are unable to refund my money. Basically, their thought is that there is a chance that I was in on the whole situation and may be benefiting from what has taken place. I was unaware of what was going on and wound up getting money stolen from me and nobody from Wells Fargo can give me any more options."
276,"Date : XX/XX/XXXX Time : XXXX XXXX XXXX  : XXXX Customer Card : XXXX Transaction : XXXX Withdrawal from Credit Card ATM Fee : {$3.00} Withdrawal from Credit Card : {$1000.00} Total Amt : {$1000.00} Summary : I initiated the above referenced cash advance using my XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card and received 20 [ {$50.00} ] bills totaling {$1000.00} in US Currency. 

At XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, the funds were deposited via ATM with XXXX XXXX XXXX. From the deposit, the ATM rejected [ 1 ] of the {$50.00} from my deposit. I I next took the bill to the teller for deposit who attempted to manually make the deposit, processing the bill thru the currency counter. The bill rejected and upon review by the teller manager, it was stated that based on the counter rejecting the bill as well as the ATM, most likely the bill was counterfeit currency. I explained the bill was disbursed to me via Wells Fargo XXXX  XXXX location and in response XXXX XXXX informed me they would not be able to deposit the bill into my checking account for credit. Their recommendation was to present the bill to Wells Fargo and explain their ATM had disbursed the bill from my ATM XXXX XXXX cash advance. 

I returned to Wells Fargo Bank and explained to the bank lobby teller. An attempt was made by the teller to process the currency thru his bill processor however the bill was rejected. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, instructed me he would have to retain the bill which would be returned to the XXXX XXXX XXXX and that he would not be able to assist me further. I asked to have a copy [ front/back ] of the bill for my records to which the teller provided. 
Serial Number : XXXX Series : XXXX XXXX XXXX provided me his business card with instructions to call the Customer Service who would be able to file a Reg E Claim. He disclosed a 10-day timeline is projected to resolve the claim. I initiated a call and spoke with Customer Service and was informed they would not be able to assist me as I was not a Wells Fargo customer. The recommendation was to contact XXXX XXXX for assistance as I was their customer and resolution would be provided from their servicing portals. 

I next spoke with XXXX XXXX and was informed they would not be able to assist me as this was a Wells FargoXXXX XXXX XXXX as ATM currency is deposited/exchanged between the two parties. It was explained that this was not an XXXX XXXX issue. 

In closing, I have not received a response from Wells Fargo regarding the disposition of the claim or from XXXX XXXX regarding the recovery of the {$50.00} I lost from the transaction. In addition, the experience I received from this ordeal results in me not EVER using an ATM terminal again. 

Any assistance that you can provide is welcomed and appreciated."

278,"On XX/XX/22 I attempted to purchase tickets through a XXXX XXXX for sporting events. I was contacted by the actual group admin who said she had tickets. We agreed on a price of {$800.00} and I sent the money through XXXX using my Wells Fargo app. At that point the seller had my XXXX account information and said she was then sending the tickets. She then blocked me on XXXX and I never received the tickets. I filed a complaint with XXXX showing all the message conversations and the fact I sent her my XXXX account. I also provided information that showed no tickets had been sent to my account. They immediately closed the page down and banned the seller. I then contacted Wells Fargo and filed a complaint. I was told by two different employees that I would be able to receive my money back. I also asked them if they needed any proof of the conversation or from my XXXX account. I was told "" no '' and if any info was needed I would be contacted. I reached back out to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/22 and they informed me my complaint was closed and they were not going to refund my money. They said they sent a request to the bank the transaction went to in order to recoup funds but no response was received. They also told me to reach out to the financial institution that the transaction was received. However they told me they did not have that banking information. I offered proof of the XXXX  messages as well as the XXXX information and they declined to receive it and told me to take that to Law Enforcement. At this point they are telling me I am out {$800.00} even though I had proof it was a scam."
280,"XX/XX/2021 : I went into Wells Fargo to make a wire transfer to another Wells Fargo account in the US for the amount of {$190000.00}. 

The other person verified that the money never arrived to his/her account. 
I have been contacting Wells Fargo ( both on the phone and inside the branch ) and the only resolution given to me was to wait. I have filed multiple complaints with Wells Fargo but they just bounce me around and keep putting me on hold. 

I have been waiting for 7 months and the money is still not back to my account. I have also tried getting from a lawyer but it did not bring any resolution. It is a large sum amount of money and it is causing a lot of trauma to the point where I feel depressed. This matter really disturbed my life and it is damaging my finances. 

I would really appreciate if CFPB can look into this matter and help me resolve with the bank."
281,"On Wednesday, XX/XX/2022 I deposited a cashier 's check written from XXXX XXXX  to my Wells Fargo checking account in the amount of {$38000.00}. Prior to deposit, I verified XXXX different times with the teller that there would not be a hold on this check. She checked the bank system and noted "" the system does not recommend a hold on this ; {$400.00} will be available today and the remaining {$38000.00} will be available tomorrow. '' The next day, XX/XX/2022, all of the funds were present and available in my account. After double checking availability of funds, I proceeded to make a payment to an auto loan servicer in the amount of {$38000.00}. 

On the morning of XX/XX/2022, I received an email stating my checking account had a balance of - {$38000.00}. I called the bank as soon as I could and checked on the matter. After explaining my concerns/situation, the banker at a local branch informed me that a hold was placed on the funds "" after the fact '' because Wells Fargo had not yet received funds from XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX they had hoped ''. I informed the banker of my conversation and clarification with the teller on the day of the deposit and asked how this issue of not receiving funds from another bank was deemed a customer issue. I asked the reasoning behind a hold "" after the fact '' and also asked why if there was to be a hold, why I was not notified. He then stated "" someone had been in contact with XXXX XXXX  '' but there had not been any answer from them regarding the availability of funds at this time. This was a cashiers check and had been through a verification of funds prior to XXXX issuing the check to the individual who wrote it to me. 

I was instructed the only options were to make a transfer to cover the negative balance of - {$38000.00} ( which was not an option ), or to wait until the hold period was over on Monday XX/XX/2022. I asked about the timeline of the hold and he stated it was to be a XXXX day hold starting Monday XX/XX/2022. This is starting XXXX days after the deposit on which I was told there would be no hold. I inquired about waiving fees that would ultimately be incurred due to this bank-to-bank issue, and he stated "" once the hold period is over, we can see which fees we are able to refund ''. I then asked at what point the customer is to be responsible for bank-to-bank transactions of this nature and he stated customers were not responsible for them. He informed me he would escalate this issue appropriately and I would receive an email with an escalation complaint number and hear from "" someone in the escalation department within a few business days ''. 

This type of issue between banks is not acceptable and should NEVER reach the customer 's bank account ; especially after funds had been available for days prior."
283,"So I was scammed through someone posing to be my landlord. I had contacted them through a posting online in the beginning of XXXX. Then they later claimed they wanted the money through the post office money order. I met up with someone they claimed was a realtor who took my money and id. I was told I could pick up the keys then and I told to get new locks on the XXXX. I was there on the move in day. I found out that the building was owned by someone else. Also that someone else had moved in a week ago. I went to the police to file a report. They told me to check with the three major credit beaureus if there was any credit cards under my name or to inform them. They could only direct me to the FTC, and had me file a case for their detective. Then I went to the Post office but they made me pay a fee to investigate who the check went to. Also they said it would take two weeks to even get my money back. I have to move out soon so this makes it harder as I have to wait and see if theyll even be able to help or give me a not even full but they said a percentage of a refund. On top of this theres a whole secondary process for them to investigate it this further. Then I had to file a case at my bank Wells Fargo but they said because the money order wasnt with them I couldnt get my money back even though theyre the only one I bank with. Its honestly really sad and frustrating the way that the individual must make these leaps and we still have to pay to get our money back even though identity theft and scammers are so commonplace these days. Alongside this I was hoping to get a new numbers for my id, ssid, etc. Attached is the email of the scammer, proof the money was taken, also the contact name they pretended to be."
284,"On XX/XX/2022, my phone was stolen in XXXX, my phone was pass code protected, yet the person/persons who stole my phone were able to unlock it and get into my online banking and digital wallet. I was not aware of the transactions that were being made on my device, nor did I authorize anyone to make those transactions, I had only become aware of the unauthorized activity when an individual who I was traveling with, received a call from my wife, stating that she had received some calls from our family and friends that I was texting them that I was in trouble and needed them to send me money via XXXX XXXX  At that time my wife checked our accounts and noticed the strange activity on our accounts, so she proceeded to call Wells Fargo online and alerted them and opened a claim. When I was made aware I called Wells Faro Online and had them deactivate my online banking and freeze my accounts. I filed a police report with the XXXX Police Department on XXXX XXXX. They used my digital debit card that was on my phone, they transferred money from my online savings into my two different checking accounts, they created a new digital card from a checking account that was never linked to my phone, and they added 2 new XXXX contacts and transferred money with XXXX. I have filed multiple claims with Wells Fargo, have gone into ( 2 ) Wells Fargo branches and had a banker call and help me dispute the claims, I faxed over the police report and did not receive confirmation that it was received, I have called numerous times and I am not able to speak to whomever is handling my claims. I just received letters stating that my claims were denied. I filed a claim with an executive and I never received a call only an email that my claim was denied. Only XX/XX/XXXX I received an email that one of claims was approved that a mistake had been made and it was reversed, I called about my other claims, yet I was told there were denied. On XXXX XXXX I submitted a complaint and I was informed that all but the XXXX transactions had been submitted in my claims so I had to submit a new claim. I submitted a new claim for the XXXX and they were denied.All this was done without my authorization, knowledge, and by someone I do not know. Below is a summary what was done on my accounts : 1. ( 2 ) online transfers between my accounts one for {$5000.00} and one for {$6000.00} 2. 28 transactions using my digital debit card that was linked to my everyday checking account, of the 28 transactions 16 went through for a total of {$4900.00}. This claim was reversed on XX/XX/2022 3. A new digital card was created and a total of 11 transactions were made with all of them going through for a total of {$1000.00}. This claim was approved by the fraud department 4. ( 2 ) new XXXX recipients were added and they sent {$25000.00} to one and {$830.00} to the other. This claim was never opened prior to the original complaint and it had to be opened after. I called and they stated that this claim was denied."
286,"XXXX FRAUD happened on my XXXX year old son and my joint Wells Fargo account on XX/XX/XXXX. We live in Colorado. However someone in Georgia made 3 false ATM? check deposits. Basically blank checks, except for the amounts written on them for {$200.00}, {$160.00} & {$40.00}. Totaling {$400.00}. ( Note we have NEVER been to Georgia or know anyone in GA. AT ALL! ) Immediately after the check deposits were made, this criminal scammer sent the same {$400.00} to themselves via XXXX pay, which made the account go negative. ( There was only about {$75.00} or so in the account before all of this happened. ) We immediately filed fraud charges with Wells Fargo via phone. Then they transferred us to a different WF department to file the XXXX transaction as fraud. They told us everything should be cleared up within 10 business days. 

Side note* I had forgotten that we had an automatic transfer set up from a savings to his checking for {$100.00} every Monday that would go into his account. It did go into his account that Monday, still keeping his account negative, but WF would not reverse that and give him our {$100.00} back! Seriously! So frustrating! 

WF did finally acknowledge the checks were fraudulent and reversed those charges. However when two weeks passed and we still heard nothing in regards to the XXXX fraud, and the account was still negative, we called WF back on XX/XX/XXXX. They literally LOST the XXXX claim! Couldn't find it anywhere in their system. So we filed another claim, and we were told we would hear back within 10 business days. My son had his birthday, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and our family vacation with NO money, except some cash we lent him. But no debit card, no working checking account, etc. 

Again, no word from WF within the next 10 days, so I called them back again on XX/XX/XXXX. I can't even make this up, but they said they literally couldn't find the second XXXX claim that was filed on XX/XX/XXXX! I gave them case numbers, reference numbers, rep names, etc. But they said they couldn't find it and would file ANOTHER ONE! I am beyond frustrated at this point! The next time I spoke to them, they said the XXXX claim was declined and that they would not refund the money! I can't XXXX  believe this! Someone STOLE {$400.00} from a XXXX year old 's account and our bank that we TRUST with ALL of our personal and business accounts, won't refund our money?! 

Wells Fargo MUST investigate and dig deeper into this FRAUD to find the persons account that it went into and go after that SCAMMER! Not deny their customer what's rightfully our money! What about Regulation E, the Electronic Funes Transfer Act?! Wells Fargo, GIVE US OUR MONEY BACK PLEASE! This is 100 % FRAUDULENT! My son has NEVER USED XXXX! EVER! He uses XXXX and has no clue how to even use XXXX! 

WF says the {$400.00} XXXX payment was sent with the phone number on file for him? 100 % FALSE! I went into the WF branch where we opened our accounts at, and spoke to the banker that has us as clients on his books. He wants to fight for us but there's only so much he can do. I sat in the branch for an hour while he called the fraud department himself and they told him to fax any additional information to them. Therefore we faxed all of the phone 's information, such as the IMEI, serial number, etc. to the phone to prove that this must have been a mobile hacking and was absolutely NOT my sons doing, or on his device! NO WAY! 

Here we are into XXXX! Tomorrow will be 2 months since this happened and the account is still negative! WF is going to report us in two days to a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX, which will affect my sons ability to get a bank account in the future. They only way WF won't do this is if we bring the account to {$0.00} from the negative balance! Seriously, we have to give them another {$180.00} to bring the account to {$0.00} now, just so we won't be reported! I have no choice but to pay this! I am in such shock! 

I have NEVER had, or heard of a bank denying legitimate fraud claims on behalf of their customers! The sad thing is that this is also happening to other people for even more money! XXXX it, it's terrible! How can we trust any bank at this point!? Or XXXX for that matter! Disgusting! PLEASE GIVE BACK OUR MONEY WELLS FARGO, before I have to take legal action! It's the principal at this point! Do the right thing for your customer, or I'm seriously taking legal action and moving all of our accounts to another bank!"

After I sent this payment, she was very uncommunicative. On the day that she was supposed to repay me, she blocked me on the social media that I was using to talk to her and I am unable to communicate in order to get my money back. As it stands, she stole my money and had no means to ever pay me back. I filed a claim through XXXX, however, they said that the transaction in question didnt count as a service that they can refund me for.

After filing a claim a few days ago, I wanted to check the status of it today, but when I called my bank ( Wells Fargo ) they notified me that the claim has been denied since the transaction was authorized on my part and they would be unable to help since it was a service. Im worried that I wont be reimbursed for this, since the money in question came from my savings.

I have been a good customer for 15 years, never delinquent and have made occasional high deposits in the past. This is not the first time that this has happened and been held.

I do not believe that XXXX business days and XXXX in total is reasonable and complies with Regulation CC. I spoke withXXXX XXXX"
296,"To Whom It May Concern : Im writing in regard to a fraud claim that I have filed with Wells Fargo Bank. 

On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX I received a text at XXXX which stated Wells Fargo Alert Transaction for {$430.00} at XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. Text Y if recognized. I DID NOT respond to the text message. Shortly after receiving the text, my phone rang at XXXX with a caller ID from Wells Fargo and phone number showing XXXX. I answered the call because I recognized the phone number on my WF debit card. The man calling said he was from Wells Fargo Fraud Security Department, and he wanted to verify some transactions trying to post to my account. He then said he needed to verify my identity and sent me a code ( from Wells Fargo ) to read back to him. This is a standard procedure of Wells Fargo that I have been asked before, so I assumed it was legit. He proceeded to read transactions that I did not do and some that I did do from my checking account. I trusted he was indeed calling from Wells Fargo because he knew my account activity. He then proceeded to file claims and give me reference numbers to go along with them for each transaction. Towards the end of the phone call, he asked for my PIN number, and I said "" NO I never give out my PIN number ''. I then started to worry and when I hung up the phone and I immediately called Wells Fargo as I was nervous something was wrong. While on the phone I drove to my local branch and waited in the parking lot for them to open. The banker informed me that this man was not a Wells Fargo employee. This man who was a Wells Fargo imposter hacked into my online banking and changed my password. He was transferring money in my accounts during this call without my knowledge. I never gave him my account numbers, passwords, PIN number or any authorization to transfer any kind of money or access my account. He transferred {$20000.00} from my Wells Fargo credit card ( that I never use & Ive had since I was XXXX old ) and moved it to my business checking account. He also transferred {$1200.00} from my personal checking account and moved it to my business checking account. He then used an additional {$1300.00} from my business checking and sent a wire transfer totaling {$22000.00} out of my business checking account to someone I DO NOT know. I DID NOT authorize any of this!!!!! Im amazed how this amount of money was able to be transferred without some kind of red flag to the bank. 

With the assistance of the banker, we filed a fraud claim over the phone. I did a lost stolen transfer on all of my accounts and changed all of my bank card numbers. When I called to check on the status of my claim, I was told that Wells Fargo never made a claim on the wire transfer I reported the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, so they filed another one. I later received a letter stating that my request done on XX/XX/XXXX ( was actually XX/XX/XXXX ) was denied. Another letter I received from XXXX XXXX XXXX  stated that wire recall requests were sent on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. Again, not referencing the day I made the claim on XX/XX/XXXX. I was given a letter stating that I am responsible for online wires using my username and password. This man changed my password and fraudulently accessed my account without my knowledge! I have since escalated my claim and have the branch manager and branch banker trying to help as much as they can ; however, we are all getting the run around every time we call. Wells Fargo has also reported my credit card for being over the limit and now my credit is at stake. This should not have been done as it is still under investigation. Im disputing this with the credit reporting agency as well. The inconsistency of information I have received is unbelievable. It has been over a month and it has begun to take a toll on my physical and mental health. 

As a small business owner, I feel discriminated against because I am not a High Value Customer and not viewed as a high priority to Wells Fargo. I am being treated as if the matter is not urgent. It is extremely urgent to me, I DO NOT have this amount of money to lose. I have been a loyal Wells Fargo customer for 24 years and I am not being treated as a valued or protected customer. I feel completely violated! I have been stolen from using the online tools that Wells Fargo provides and Wells Fargo has done nothing to make me whole again. I know Wells Fargo has fraud insurance and thought my money was protected. I am seeking legal advice as this is 100 % fraud and the way I have been treated throughout this process is not acceptable. I believe that my claim is still being investigated but its unclear. I sincerely hope that Wells Fargo will do the right thing before I am forced to take legal action. 

Please restore all the funds that were stolen from me and resolve this matter immediately before my credit is further impacted. I filed a police report on XX/XX/XXXX as well."
297,"I had noticed there was {$800.00} transferred from my account to another account via XXXX  on XXXX  morning XXXX. I contacted Wells Fargo the same day about the situation to file a fraud claim claiming that it wasnt me. They told me theyd get back to me in XXXX business days. Today was the XXXX business day so I decided to call them to see where the process is at, because XXXX XXXX received a call or any update referring to my case. The agent I spoke to stated that my claim had been denied on XX/XX/XXXX & that there was nothing I can do to dispute the charges. I am now filing this claim in hopes to properly get this resolved."

He created a Wells Fargo account somehow- XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX CA XXXX. XXXX Account XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX ( XXXX ) : XXXX to transfer all of my money into. Wells Fargo bank address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA. When I asked how the transfer of that large amount of money could have gone through Wells Fargo without raising any red flags he said that on his records someone from my phone called Wells Fargo and okayed the transfer and the transfer was pending. Hackers told me that my phone was hacked too as it has been connected to my computer with my Wells Fargo information. He told me that there has been other account holders that have been reporting the same type of issue and that there is an investigation going on internally within Wells Fargo as the thinking is that it is an inside Wells Fargo employee doing the hacking. He then put me on hold as he reported the fraud to my Wells Fargo account to the Federal Trade Commission for XXXX and he gave me the Federal Trade Commission report number # XXXX that he received from the commission for my files. He directed me to go into my bank immediately to transfer my funds to the new Wells Fargo account he created before the transfer of the {$47000.00} was able to be completed. He said once the XXXX  charge to my account is completed and closed, within XXXX days, the money would be put back into my Wells Fargo account for me to then sign up for increased security on my Wells Fargo account XXXX I went to my bank and went to the teller and had him transfer my {$50000.00} that I had in my savings into my checking account to have all my money in XXXX account. Then I sat with a personal banker to proceed with a transfer of my life savings totaling {$91000.00} over to the new created account so there would not be enough money in my Wells Fargo account for the illegal transaction to be completed. The bank was not busy and I was able to speak with XXXX XXXX, personal banker, immediately after the banker transferred my money in my savings account into my checking account. The hacker who was impersonating a Wells Fargo representative told me that since there is an internal investigation going on within Wells Fargo to figure out who the employee is that is doing these acks of fraud to Wells Fargo account holders that I should not give any information on why I am transferring all of my money to a brand new created account in XXXX. He said to not mention the hack that I am experiencing so there would not be any red flags alerting the Wells Fargo employee that I was participating in the investigation on the fraud being done to other Wells Fargo account holders. He informed me that the personal banker will ask me about the reason for such a large transfer and to say that I am purchasing land and that I would be asked how I know XXXX XXXX and for how long and to respond that I have known him for over XXXX years. XXXX XXXX did not question me about the transfer even though I had just transferred all of my savings into my checking and immediately was transferring all my money ( {$91000.00} ) to a different branch in XXXX Ca, in a different name and a place with a XXXX XXXX XXXX that I have never had Wells Fargo transactions before. 
The bank XXXX later informed me that XXXX XXXX XXXX raise a red flag and are not permitted and the transfer of my funds should not have been made without a permanent address. If she would have questioned me about the transfer and learned of the circumstances, she would undoubtedly have contacted a superior or the fraud unit and not done the transfer. 

That Thursday afternoon ( XX/XX/2022 ) I received XXXX text messages to my phone stating that the people I was talking to in tech support and the bank was not from tech support and bank, theyre scammers from XXXX and they will contact you to transfer funds from your account to their account in the name of the Wire - dont transfer any funds, if you did the transfer stop that wire immediately from the bank before its too late! From # ( XXXX ) XXXX. 
Can this number be investigated to see who this came from since they are connected somehow to the Wells Fargo fraud to accounts? 
I called Wells Fargo right away and was informed that Wells Fargo would not do this and to go to the bank as soon as they opened in the morning and stop the transaction. I requested to have the transfer stopped right then though was directed to go into the branch where the transfer was made. I would expect banks should have a means of intervening to protect depositors accounts on an emergency basis. The customer service representative I talked to must have had some way to connect me to a fraud department or something similar to be able to put a stop to the whole thing that evening. 
XX/XX/2022, I was at the XXXX XXXX branch when they opened and XXXX XXXX XXXX, personal banker XXXX XXXX : XXXX, who assisted with the transfer of funds to the Wells Fargo created account on Thursday, put a freeze on the transfer as the transaction was still pending. During this time the Wells Fargo hacker continued to call me and text me from ( XXXX ) XXXX. I let him know that I was in the bank branch and to contact XXXX to discuss the freeze on the transfer which he did not and the calls and texts from him stopped immediately. 
I then went to drop off my government computer as it was hacked and the government had to wipe the computer and all information from it for security purposes. 
I was again at Wells Fargo Monday XX/XX/2022 to check in on the status and to make sure that the transfer was not completed and to see if any additional information was known about how this could have happened. I was told that the transfer was not frozen. I cried. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ID : XXXX, looked into transactions and what had happened and what to do next. 
Background status. XXXX and XXXX filed a case recall Friday XX/XX/2022 - # XXXX and claim # XXXX on the created fraud Wells Fargo account XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX CA XXXX. XXXX Account XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX ( XXXX ) : XXXX.

XX/XX/2022 sent XXXX email to check in on status and any additional information that is needed. At the bank again, Bank XXXX, XXXX, called and the fraud and wire department did not have an update and said they were looking into it. He sent XXXX an email and left her a message.

She doesnt know how long it will take but she cant do anything from her end until it is resolved from their end. She is going to forward all my emails to the fraud department so they have all the additional information that I have provided XXXX in case they do not. She gave me the fraud number XXXX. I sent an email to XXXX ( bank XXXX ) XX/XX/2022 to update XXXX on the conversation with XXXX and give him the fraud number so he has it too. 
XX/XX/2022 - wire and fraud transfer team # XXXX claim # XXXX - # XXXX. Wire transfer department waiting on debit authority and said that there is nothing I can do at this point as the wire transfer department is waiting to hear from the debit authority before they can move forward with putting money back into my account. Debit authority is looking into the beneficiary of the other account and reaching out to get the money back from them. If no account, they are still looking into contacting who opened the account. Message sent out to other banks that this is fraud. Waiting on other bank to get back on authorizing putting funds back into my account = debit authority. 
I asked - Who is the debit authority who oks the money to be put back into my account? Who do I contact from debit authority to make sure they have all the information? answer that they do not know Do I contact the fraud department to ask this? Does the fraud department communicate with the debit authority. Answer no the departments are separate and only get messages regarding the status of the claim i.e., being investigated, or waiting on debit authority. Nothing about the information on the case just the status from other departments that are working on it. Wire transfer department forwarded me to fraud department. Transferred and hung up saying that they can not process my call right now. Called back multiple times and got number to fraud department XXXX call back they are busy XX/XX/2022 XXXX. Call back again need extension to fraud contact. Nobody knows. Called number representative gave me XXXX. They told me that they could not complete my inquiry and to hang up. I called police department to follow up on my investigation left message at XXXX on XX/XX/2022 requesting an update on my case # XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX. 
XX/XX/2022 - I called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and left message for XXXX line and extension XXXX Ext. XXXX. Purpose of call - checking in again to see if the additional information on my fraud case included the email correspondence from me to XXXX and you ( XXXX ) and the Wells Fargo branch manager/s was sent to the fraud and wire department and if XXXX received XXXX response from them and a contact who is investigating the case. 
I was able to get ahold of a Wells Fargo representative and was given an update that the fraud department support department is reaching out because XXXX left a message to follow up with them in her notes on the case in the case file XX/XX/2022 or XXXX. Checking with XXXX in on-line wire department. XXXX. Transferred me back to wire department. Started process over. XXXX. Finally got through to a representative who could provide some information. The representative stated that - XXXX was XX/XX/2022. XXXX forwarded my information on XX/XX/2022 to the fraud department. The representative said that the email information I had provided before XX/XX/2022 was sent to the fraud department from XXXX. The representative said that the information she forwarded can be opened by the fraud and wire department. The representative said they can see all the information provided by XXXX on XX/XX/2022. The representative said that a recall attempt was made a couple times and the department is still waiting on the Wells Fargo XXXX branch to respond with the ok to release the funds from their branch and account. The representative said the bank XXXX is working on recalling the money from the Wells Fargo XXXX branch to my Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX branch and get it deposited back into my account. 
I can not seem to get a direct contact to the persons from each department assigned to my fraud case so I dont know who to contact about the case and any information that they might need to investigate and resolve it. Does a lawyer have access to this information? Can a lawyer make contact and get a response to the person in charge of investigating? 

Summary of Bank responses since XX/XX/2022 XX/XX/2022 emailed XXXX to provide update that they are waiting for the Wells Fargo XXXX branch to respond. 
XX/XX/2022 checked back in and same status. 
XX/XX/2022 my case was further escalated to a XXXX  XXXX from the case worker ( XXXX ). Wells Fargo XXXX representative sent out a request for an update. I received a hard copy of the police report in the mail. It is not exactly correct and I don't know how to update it from the website. 
XX/XX/2022 there was not an update recorded in the system. 
XX/XX/2022 no update just that it was escalated and assigned to a Claims XXXX. There is no update on a response yet. Emailed XXXX just to give her an update on the case. XXXX. 
XX/XX/2022 - Wire department said that the account was closed XX/XX/2022. They reached out to the Wells Fargo XXXX branch and the account was closed. The wire department said that my case can only be closed by a banker or loss prevention not the wire department. The representative gave me the loss prevention number to call to check in as the wire department 's role is just to look into a wire and get the money back or stop/start a wire transfer. Basically, the wire department has done its job of requesting the money back and the money was not there to give back, so their step is closed and I need to contact a different department again. I received a letter dated XX/XX/2022 from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, SD XXXX ) The letter states : At this time, we would like to inform you as of XX/XX/2022, no further update has been received by our fraud department. The case currently remains open, pending debit authorization or further instruction. Once our fraud department completes their fraud claim investigation, they will mail resolution letter directly to you, communicating their claim determination. For updates, you XXXX also contact the Wire Customer Support department at XXXX ( the number I have been calling ). 
We appreciate your time and effort you took to contact us. If you have questions, please contact us at XXXX ext. XXXX. We are ready to help you Monday through Friday from XXXX am to XXXX pm central time. 
I left XXXX a message XXXX ext. XXXX asking what to do now that the wire department closed their case. Where does it go now? Who do I contact regarding the investigation? I am waiting for her response. I called the loss prevention number. The representative informed me to go to the bank and talk with the XXXX to get all documentation on my case and to call back so the XXXX can talk with XXXX of their loss prevention people to help assist with what to send and/or save and print for me to take to the police department. I went to the bank and talked with XXXX. He called XXXX and left a message regarding my case and requested she call back with information on how to resolve my case and retrieve my money. He made me aware that he does not have access to all the documentation between all the departments in Wells Fargo and that most likely that information would need to be court ordered by the police department. I let him know that I was going to the police station again to provide all additional information and would keep in contact to give him updates. He provided his card to give to the police XXXX to reach out to him with any questions or if he could help out with the case at all. 
XX/XX/2022 I went to the XXXX Police XXXX and provided all copies of the additional emails and correspondence I have had and updates to Wells Fargo case numbers and contacts descripting all the steps and contacts that have been ongoing since the beginning of my case, XX/XX/2022."
304,"On Tuesday, XX/XX/2022 I went into the local branch to initiate a domestic wire in the amount of {$71000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX the local branch XXXX, XXXX XXXX, called requesting more info regarding the recipient. I provided her the info requested over the phone. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and their XXXX dept still has not released the funds, nor have they requested more information. Wells Fargo is intentionally holding onto people 's money and using their XXXX employees as a valid reason to defraud consumers. These unjustifiable delays are well known in the industry ( I spoke to XXXX former XXXX employees that said this is a known issue for XXXX and the rest of the industry is well aware of their bad practices ). Wells Fargo is causing harm to consumers by delaying valid and credible transactions where no fraud or evidence of nefarious activities exist. These payments are often used to pay off loans and in the process are causing unnecessary and inexcusable late fees, additional daily interest fees, etc. that affect the individual consumer. I received a call today from XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX over the branch that initiated my wire ) stating that he has tried to reach his XXXX XXXX for what possible explanation they have in holding up the wire and they have failed to respond even after internal escalation. He admitted to me over the phone that this is a known issue within Wells Fargo Bank that is knowingly causing significant financial harm to consumers."
306,"I have submitted many complaints against Wells Fargo Bank. I would just like to submit more documents to support my allegations against the fraud and deceptive practices of this financial institution. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX"
309,Completed an international wire transfer to XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/2017 in the amount of C {$55000.00}. The amount sent in USD was {$43000.00}. Giving an exchange of rate of 1.292599. Historical data shows an exchange rate of 1.3249 on XXXX/XXXX/2017. There were no disclosures given to me our my company at the time of the exchange.
310,i had been emailing XXXX about purchasing a animal i had sent XXXX dollars on XXXX with wells fargo to XXXX XXXX they supposedly where shipping it out on XX/XX/XXXX the shipping company was mx movers they tried to make me send an additional XXXX on top of the XXXX for a thermal heating cage for major temperature changes which seemed very odd i didnt send it. i ended the call and tried to reach the breeder which i didnt get a response at all until a while after then they just tried to make me feel bad for not sending the XXXX dollars like you really are going to do this to a poor animal then i asked for a refund as their website petlandferrets.com said i would if i wasnt happy they then didnt reply at all and i tried calling the number ( XXXX ) and they had answered it was the same XXXX guy i talked to for the mover company and he ended the call and just blocked me. i had talked to my bank and they arent taking it seriously and arent helping.
313,"Commencing on or about XX/XX/2022, I fell victim to a multilayered scam operation orchestrated by XXXX ( the Company ), which involved me making deposits for a total amount of XXXX USD from my WELLS FARGO account to fraudulent investment firm ( s )."
314,"On theXX/XX/XXXXI deposited a check written out to me into my account for the amount of {$16000.00}. The check was written by my grandfather who confirmed with his bank and got evidence that the check cleared with his bank and the money was transferred to Wells Fargo ( my bank ) on the XX/XX/XXXX My bank originally told me that the funds would be available on the XXXX. On the XXXX I checked my account and not only were the funds not available but there was no amount from the check available in my account and the bank was telling me it would not be available and was placed on hold till the XX/XX/XXXX. I waited till the XX/XX/XXXX to see if the funds would possibly be released sooner. When the funds were not available I called the bank because 11 days is an unreasonable amount of time for money to be available in my account when I have proof the check cleared. I spoke to several different people who gave me excuses such as : the money was not available because the check was not endorsed ( I was later told by another wells fargo employee endorsement was not necessary on my deposit and was not the real reason for this hold ), that wells fargo did not yet have the funds ( this was confirmed as a lie by my grandfathers bank ), that it was on hold because it was an unusual amount for me to deposit, that my grandfathers bank was not releasing it because it was not endorsed by me ( also confirmed as a lie by my grandfathers bank ) and that it was placed on hold to protect my grandfather who holds no accounts with them. After two hours on the phone trying to get my money rightfully released into my account and being told there was no possible way it would be available until the XXXX. On the following day, the XX/XX/XXXX, I brought my grandfather and the proof that the check had cleared his bank to a wells fargo manager at a branch. The manager told us the money hadn't been deposited because it was an unusual amount for me to deposit and that they were trying to protect him ( that is his banks job ). She then told us she could release the funds into my account right there becuase he was there to verify that he wrote the check. She never verified that my grandfather was my grandfather by asking for identification and released the funds directly into my account after I had already been told that this was not possible."
315,"My mother passed away in XXXX XXXX. She lived in her own apartment in XXXX, Florida. I am a US citizen and I live with my husband in XXXX, XXXX. I am also XXXX and am restricted to a XXXX. 
As a result of the Covid19 travel restrictions, we were unable to travel to the US to sort out and close my mother 's estate. In view of this, all communication was made by telephone or email. Therefore we suffered many setbacks. e.g. several payments to the Condo by check, were lost in the Post!! 
We decided to clear and clean the apartment and then place it on the market. The furniture was disposed of locally, my mother 's personal belongings were boxed and loaded onto a container for shipping to XXXX. The shipping company we contracted was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX contact Ms XXXX XXXX. The service proved to be excellent and all went extremely well until time came to pay a deposit of {$2000.00} to XXXX. My US account is with Wells Fargo. 
Wells Fargo internet banking is clearly still in the 'Stagecoach XXXX age. The transfer of funds was duly requested. WF in their turn posted a banker 's check on XX/XX/XXXX. This first check went to the wrong payee, having noticed the mistake, I requested that the transfer is cancelled and the {$2000.00} was refunded to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. 
In view of the mistake I requested the transfer again on XX/XX/XXXX. We received a call from Ms XXXX on Friday XX/XX/XXXX that the deposit payment hadn't been received and payment was due immediately!! We had to make yet another payment by credit transfer which cost an extra {$60.00}, so total payment was {$2000.00}. Not taking any further risks with WF, we paid the final costs using my husband 's Euro account which cleared with no problems. 
I contacted XXXX and they claim that their check was cleared on XX/XX/XXXX!!! They also claim that their check was sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the bank used by XXXX XXXX XXXX. Despite the check being cleared, the funds were never received by the payee. I have requested both banks to contact Ms. XXXX, the senior accountant at XXXX. Neither have. Ms XXXX has also tried to assist but neither bank will provide details, nor have copies of the cleared check been sent to me or to the payee 's office. Today is XX/XX/XXXX and to date, WF have opened a Claim Case, No. XXXX, also 4 Case Ref Nos., provided 5 different Telephone Nos, and handled by 7 so called Claims Specialists. They claim that the case is closed, but it isn't. My money has been lost, misappropriated or stolen!! The payee has never received the original deposit payment and neither bank have carried out a significant investigation on who cleared the check, and to who's or which company 's account. I demand : - ( 1 ) that the full amount of {$2000.00} is refunded to my account, ( 2 ) That the extra cost of {$60.00} for use of credit is refunded and ( 3 ) Some form of remuneration for the mental stress and distress caused by by each bank for their incompetence and the extra expense and inconveniences caused to both myself and my husband. 
I respectfully request that you treat this matter with the seriousness that each bank should have done. I have been defrauded of {$2000.00} and someone must account for it."
317,"On XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to purchase XXXX XXXX Tickets for {$350.00} through Wells Fargo 's online banking app via XXXX. The funds were sent to the recipients bank called XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Within 30 minutes from making the transaction and NOT receiving the tickets I filed a claim with Wells Fargo to stop the transaction. Wells Fargo responded to my claim with an initial letter that said they were investigating and that they would be contacting the other bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) and seeing if they could refund my money. On the same day as this letter, they sent a 2nd letter saying that there was nothing Wells Fargo could do and that the claim was closed. I've asked them if they could verify that the stolen/illegitimate checking account could be shut down - WF says that is up to XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX  will not discuss another account with me because I'm not their customer. 

However, Wells Fargo did tell me ( and I've learned ) some interesting things. In the letter they said that my transaction was initiated on XX/XX/XXXX. It did. They also say that this transaction did not post until XX/XX/XXXX ( 2 business days later ). This was after my dispute was filed and after they "" opened '' their investigation. Fishy. I have attempted to recover these funds with no success. I have also filed a police report. Wells Fargo also advised my to hire a lawyer. I am not sure why they would recommend this is as I believe they are advising me to sue their institution to recover my funds."
318,"On XX/XX/2022, between XXXX to XXXX, I got a call from someone claimed that they are XXXX XXXX XXXX that I need to make a payment of {$190.00} through XXXX or they will shut off my electricity with 30 minutes. So I did. Then they transfer me to their "" supervisor ''. The "" supervisor '' said the {$190.00} is not enough to stop them to cut off the electricity. The lowest is {$280.00} otherwise the electricity will shutt off still with 30 minutes. So I had to pay the {$280.00}. Then they told me to put a refund code of XXXX to get the {$190.00} back, after I did that, it actually sent another {$990.00}. So they said that I did too slow the refund code was expired, my account was locked. So they said I need to send {$490.00} safety secure deposite to get my money back. But after I sent this I still did not get my money back. I realized that I got scammed. I called Wells fargo right away, they said they gave me 3 referance code, but they closed the case in 3 or 4 days. They told me that It's like I gave them cash, so I can't get my money back."
321,"Someone in XXXX was selling a concert ticket. I offered to buy it and he wanted {$100.00}. I sent him the {$100.00} through the money transfer app XXXX. After this his number went out of service and he deleted his account. The charge was pending for three days because it was XXXX XXXX weekend, XX/XX/XXXX. I disputed the charge with my bank and when XX/XX/XXXX came around it went through anyway, my bank ( Wells Fargo ) says there is nothing they can do. They also are not able to tell me the bank of the person who scammed me."
322,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call that my phone 's caller ID identified as "" Wells Fargo, '' my bank. The caller introduced himself as being from Wells Fargo, and said there was some suspicious activity on my account and that they needed me to log onto their website ( which is something that has happened before, and the call was legitimate ). As instructed, I logged on using the mobile app and they told me to send myself a money transfer via XXXX. I logged in but, thinking it seemed fishy, I asked them why I had to do this and got only a vague, mumbled answer. I hung up on them, not giving them any personal information or login info, but later my phone was acting strangely and then {$1500.00} was missing from my account. 

What I believe happened : the scammers took advantage of a serious security flaw in Wells Fargo 's tech, hacked my phone and got the info they needed to complete a transfer and sent the money to themselves. 

I called Wells Fargo that day and they said there was nothing they can do. I filed a complaint and received a letter saying my request for return of the funds was denied. I called them to ask them to elevate my complaint. I received a further call on XX/XX/XXXX reaffirming that there was nothing they were willing to do to help their customer of over 20 years who was scammed without giving away any personal information. Wells Fargo has a shady reputation but until now I had never had any complaints."
323,"XXXX XXXX XXXX And XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) issued the check to me for the services performed by XXXX XXXX. However, this check with {$2000.00} was mailed without requiring my signature. It was stolen by someone I didn't know at all and got cashed out. 
I called XXXX, as soon as I found out. The customer service refused to do anything else, but asked me to file the "" Affidavit of Check Fraud by Payee Forged Endorsement '' with Wells Fargo. Then I filed the form and got the notary public in late XXXX, XXXX, and mailed it to Wells Fargo. I called the Wells Fargo a few times, and finally got the Case # XXXX. I was told the Bank was negotiating, and I had to wait. I didn't hear anything back from the bank, until I called again on XX/XX/XXXX. The Bank told me they closed out the case on XX/XX/XXXX, and didn't provide me any result, but only asked me to call insurance to reissue the check. 
Between this time period, both XXXX  XXXX  and I called the insurance company a few times, and the customer service always provided some misleading information, saying I need to file that fraud case, while I already did. So they obviously delayed the process. Finally XXXX  had someone connected with the Bank, but was told the Bank closed the ticket without any solution, just because the Bank didn't get the response from the other bank. 
The check issue date was XX/XX/XXXX, and I filed the fraud form on XX/XX/XXXX."
324,"On XXXX XXXX, 2017, XXXX, California Wells Fargo Bank Representative, XXXX XXXX said that a {$100.00} bill that I presented at the Bank looked counterfeit because, "" It does not have the security strip and ( he ) could not feel the raised marking on the bill. '' He confiscated the {$100.00} bill and had teller XXXX XXXX # XXXX fill out a receipt that did not contain the bill 's serial number or any other marking that would attribute that specific {$100.00} bill to me. <P/>I challenged XXXX XXXX because i had reviewed the bill and noted that it was an older, worn {$100.00} bill that was printed prior to the insertions of the security strip, but the paper was checked out as good and there were no bleed through indications that it had been printed from a lesser bill. XXXX XXXX agreed with this but said that since it did not have a security strip and he could not feel the raised markings, he was going to confiscate it. Then he became a jerk and said that he did not have to give me anything other than the receipt and tried to bully me saying, "" I thought you checked the bills ''. <P/>On XXXX XXXX, 2017, I filed a claim # XXXX with Wells Fargo Bank.

I also filed a police report with XXXX XXXX Police in XXXX, Ga ( Case # XXXX ) Couple days later I called to check the status of my claim & they tell me they didnt try to retrieve the fund until XX/XX/2021. In my mind they gave the hackers plenty of time to get away with my money & why wasnt the wire transfer stopped in XX/XX/2021 the same day i notified you & the day it happened? So, after this I made a appointment to speak with a branch manager at Wellsfargo & when I got there they just let me spoke with someone else which all she did was called the fraud dept. & said there was nothing she could do. I To my knowledge I did everything right, but I get a letter from Wellsfargo like they blaming me & refuse to reverse the funds back to my account. I thought my money was safe & insured. I been with this bank for over 20 years & never had anything like this happen & get treated like this. I work too hard for my money for someone to hack my acct & steal it!"
327,"On XXXX XXXX, 2021 I attempted to transfer payment to a vendor that required payments via either XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX. Since my bank, Wells Fargo, has the XXXX XXXX on their online banking app, I utilized it to complete the transfer of {$290.00} as payment to the vendor. The vendor supplied me with the address and name required for the transfer and I was notified of a successful transaction. However, the vendor notified me that the funds were never deposited in his account. I immediately filed a claim to re-claim my {$290.00} using the phone number provided on the XXXX page of my online banking app. It is now XXXX XXXX, 2021 and after spending hours and days in non-productive phone conversations with both XXXX and Wells Fargo, I am no closer to re-claiming my money because neither of them are willing to accept any responsibility for the missing money. They have both informed me that they have closed the claim. The Bank says they did nothing wrong so it isn't their problem, and XXXX says since I used my online banking app it is the bank that is liable. However, recently, a notice appeared on my XXXX activity page that the name provided by the vendor is "" not registered. '' This notification was not forthcoming until close to mid-XXXX. The vendor has re-verified that he never received the funds, and I, the customer, am now locked in a seemingly unsolvable Catch 22, apparently expected to just write off my {$290.00} with no recourse for recovery of it."
329,"On XX/XX/2022, the scammers pretending to be XXXX XXXX, emailed XXXX XXXX requesting a wire transfer to finalize a sale of a lot. The impersonator sent a string of emails requesting a total amount of {$370000.00} while using personal information regarding XXXX and his family and his lack of communication and resources while out of the country. The impersonator also provided banking information regarding which account to process the wire. Due to banking rules and regulations, there was a wire for {$20000.00} on XX/XX/2022, and another {$20000.00} on XX/XX/2022. XXXX then realized the money was gone and sent out an email to XXXX requesting information. The impersonator intercepted the email before sending it out to XXXX XXXXThe impersonator then pretended to email XXXX as XXXX. XXXX then reached out to XXXX via XXXX to confirm the information in the email, and then it was discovered that it was not XXXX requesting the funds. 

These scammers managed to get my accountant ( XXXX ) to wire a total of {$40000.00} USD out of my XXXX account. This is affecting all business operations including XXXXt of XXXX  and day to day business. Wells Fargo has provided little untimely feed back on my Claim filed immediately after I discovered the fraudulent wires. I feel like Wells Fargo is of no help after following their guidance and checking on the Claim every other day. 

It makes me sick to my stomach that someone can so easily scam my XXXX account and Rip me off for {$40000.00} in the United States of America. Furthermore these scammers are banking Domestically at XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX where the fraudulent wires where sent. It amazes me that USA banks would permit this Fraud."
330,"Back on XX/XX/2021 an acquaintance of mine on instagram started posting stories pertaining to a cryptocurrency company that she has recently joined. Further on her posts she was claiming how this company ; XXXX provided her great wealth in just a matter of hours. She was highly advertising it to her followers on instagram how easy it is for them, including me, to be on the same financial path like hers. She was stating that if were interested in joining the platform shes marketing she is tagging a friend- the XXXX, in her story and we can just directly send her a private message with our inquiry. I'm XXXX years old with a family here in XXXX and in the XXXX that I'm fully supporting. Investing has always been on the back of my mind, it's a matter of how to start it and who to approach prior, so when her story was presented to me i took it as an opportunity to grab. On that same day I sent her friend- the broker, a message of interest. Her XXXX page is named XXXX with a username of @ XXXX. After a while she responded back and thats when we started to exchange messages. She was telling me that she has people from different age groups and financial statuses that shes mentoring about cryptocurrency mining and how they are earning up to {$3000.00} - {$5000.00} daily. She then was asking me first how much Im willing to start to invest and if I'm truly certain in joining she asked me to purchase bitcoin worth my investment via XXXX XXXX and send her a screenshot to get started. I did purchase Bitcoin from a cash app worth {$1000.00} on XX/XX/2021 using my Wells Fargo debit card that was linked in my XXXX XXXX wallet and after I completed the transaction I sent her a screenshot of it as a proof that I bought it. The broker, XXXX, told me to send it to the platform address of their crypto mining company which is XXXX and If needed I have their wallet address. Prior to that we had some small problems because I was having issues purchasing bitcoins from XXXX XXXX with a large amount of money. She then recommended a few websites to buy bitcoin from- she was sending me links for XXXX and XXXX but still nothing was working. I was having the same issues - error on purchasing bitcoins. Afterwards I asked her if I could send it through XXXX or XXXX instead, in which she agreed to do all the transactions through XXXX. I used XXXX bank accounts, my Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX account for most of the transactions, but there were XXXX transactions where I bought bitcoin from a Bitcoin ATM ; this was one of her suggestions with regards to purchasing bitcoins as well. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent her money through XXXX with an amount of {$3500.00}. She instructed me to have this email XXXX as the recipient. She was stating that this fee is to upgrade my trading account so i can have a bigger profit limit and subsequently an email was sent to me stating that I need to make another payment for conversion rate code because it being required to be issued to verify that there is a legal transaction between me and basecoinmining trading company, they further stated that this is mandatory for withdrawals via crypto wallet deposits for investors within the united states, as within regulations on trade being monitored by the XXXX and XXXX. I adhered to all their requests and I sent the amount of money that they were asking. I was entrusting them my money, I was asking for reassurance of business and she was telling me all the promises and how my trading account is blooming thanks to their work. She was telling me that I can watch and check how my money is working for me through their website. It was a perfect scheme, I was under the complete impression that everything was legit. It wasnt until later on when it dawned on me. But I further went on trading with them, i am receiving emails from the company on what are the next steps for me and my trading account, on the emails they kept asking me for fees that I need to pay such as, transfer license so I can make withdrawals from my trading account to XXXX XXXX account, payment for conversion rate codes, as well as payment to them for TAX charges for IRS, and payment for high traffic charge due to high price of bitcoins. After a while with all the payments I was being asked for, my suspicions started to surface. I was messaging them back on how and when I can withdraw my profits, but all the response I received was soon, when I made this additional payment. On XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX I sent the broker another transaction through XXXX using my XXXX XXXX bank with the amount of {$2200.00} and I was instructed to send it to the same recipient XXXX. She was stating that this is another payment that I need to make so I can withdraw my money from their website. The XXXX other transactions were through a Bitcoin ATM and I paid that with cash. I got both of the receipts with the wallet address of the fake broker that told me to send the bitcoin to. The first transaction was {$2500.00} on XX/XX/2021 and the second one was on XX/XX/2021 with the amount of {$1500.00}. On XX/XX/2021 still with no definite answer on when can i receive my funds I found out that that friend of mine from XXXX who initially posted the story referring us to the fake broker have her account hacked, I have on my phone the information and proof that her account got hacked by someone else that might be link to the person who is behind the fake brokers account as well. I tried to confront the fake broker but I did not get the response that I needed. I sent them a couple more messages prior to the matter but they stopped responding to me. I already filed a report of fraud to my banks and I also submitted a report to the Federal Trade Commision. I am with high hopes that I'm able to retrieve all of my money, if not just even a percentage of it. I was blinded with the thought of having fast money. But all 's too good to be true, I invested all my savings and basically every penny that I have. I am greatly seeking help on my case. I am an honest citizen of the United States, I am actively serving this country. I work in the military in which we arent highly compensated with money. I hold so many plans for my money which are mostly to help my family, but all of which seems to be impossible. I am struggling so badly and am having a hard time seeing the light in the tunnel that Im in, despite it all I'm still hoping to get through this matter. I am desperately asking for help that someone will get back with me prior and assist me in furthering my case. I am willing to cooperate if any more information is required. Thank you and God bless!"
333,"Transaction Amount : {$250.00} Date of Occurrence : XX/XX/2021 Description of Incident : I was looking to buy tickets to the Minnesota XXXX XXXX XXXX off of XXXX  using the below link. The link is still active now. I called the man, who went by XXXX. We talked for a while as I used to live in the XXXX area and he was telling me he was there at the time of our conversation. He could speak very well to the details of the area so I knew he had to be there or be from there. He also had a XXXX telephone number. Given the XXXX were playing the XXXX XXXX in Minnesota I didn't think anything of it. He said he would transfer the tickets to me as soon as he received the money. I used Well 's Fargo 's XXXX service to send him the money as we were on the phone together. He then said he needed to receive a code from ticket master, the ticket broker, to send me the tickets. He said they were calling him to give him the code, then hung up and never called back. I called him back numerous times to no avail. I also text him numerous times and he still didn't respond. I have the call and text logs as well. I contacted Wells Fargo and took the complaint process as far as it would go. They told me that since I voluntarily sent him the money that there is nothing they could do. My point is, there is a man using their services to commit crimes by defrauding their customers. And I can provide hard evidence. They have all of his account information and transaction history to take appropriate action to investigate the man and put a stop to him using his Wells Fargo account to defraud people and yet they refuse. This man will continue to defraud people using their services if nothing is done. 

This is the link to the XXXX ad and XXXX 's contact information. 

https : XXXX I have also provided some screen shots showing that i paid for the tickets via XXXX and never received them. Text conversations and phone records can be provided on request."

336,"I found a breeder for XXXX puppies on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX online. I filled out a form of my contact information on their website to find out more information on the puppies they had for sale. The website is XXXX. By XXXX that same day they had texted me to let me know they sent me an email and a questionnaire to see if I qualified for the puppy. I then emailed them back saying we were interested. In the email they told me they had a 30 day guarantee for a full refund, that the puppy had all its vaccinations, and so forth. They told me I would need to pay {$850.00} for the puppy and an additional {$150.00} to have it shipped if thats what I would like. So my husband and I decided to have the puppy shipped. We would've gone and picked up the puppy in Georgia but my grandfather was on hospice that week so we were unable to travel. And I made the first payment through XXXX which Wells Fargo uses as a wire transfer. This payment was made on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. The breeder stated that payment was received. I told them I was unable to send them any more money for 24 hours per Wells Fargo policy. I also stated I would not send any more until the contract was signed. XX/XX/XXXX they sent me the contract. I signed it. XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I sent the additional {$500.00}. The breeder confirmed payment the next morning and asked me when I would like the puppy delivered. I told them Id like to have it the next day Friday XX/XX/XXXX. They did not email me back. I sent another email asking when I would know the puppy would ship. They then emailed me saying that they would set up all arrangements on Friday. Friday morning they emailed me saying they set up transportation for Saturday XX/XX/XXXX and that the estimated time of arrival was XXXX. XXXX came and went. I waited an hour before reaching out to the breeder. I texted and called both numbers. I also emailed them. By XXXX someone finally text me back saying that I shouldve received a tracking number and to check my spam folder of my email. I found two emails from the airline called XXXX XXXX XXXX. One email says they had received the puppy and gave me a tracking number. The following email said that my puppy had been declined for transport due to the weather and the crate for the puppy had been rejected for transport. They stated I would need to buy a crate for {$1800.00} or I could rent the crate for {$1100.00}. They said if I rent the crate my money would be fully reimbursed once the puppy arrived to my home and was out of the crate. I informed the breeder of this information. They said they would try to get a hold of the airline to see why this was the case. I tried to call the airline. They had an unclear voice message. I also emailed the airline. They emailed me back at XXXX Saturday XX/XX/XXXX saying the same thing. Requesting I send them money through XXXX so that they can ship the puppy. The breeder also texted me back at XXXX saying the same thing. My husband and I XXXX the airline and it says that it is a scam. We did not have the name of the airline prior to this. So we could not do any research on it. We didn't even think to check that. The website said they give you a fake tracking number and tell you they are shipping your puppy, and then they say that they need an air/heat crate for transport and ask for {$1100.00}. We also found a website afterward saying that these breeders are frauds. I did try and do research, prior to the purchase of this puppy, on the breeder. My sister in law works in a law office and also told me the contract is legitimate. The website has since changed their email. I texted the breeder again and told them we do not have {$1100.00} and asked them if they would cover the cost since theyd be reimbursed. They then said they could cover {$500.00} if we could cover the rest. I stated I do not have that money and that we would come pick the dog up tomorrow. They said to contact the airline since they no longer have the puppy. The airline I contacted again through email to tell them I will come get the dog. No response. I texted them the next day stating my husband made it halfway and his truck broke down and we now need money for repairs so we would like a full reimbursement as per the contract. They never responded. I've since filed reports with the FBI, police of XXXX XXXX, Florida State Attorneys, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and Georgia State Law. Wells Fargo closed my claim without telling me. They state no fraud has been done on their part since I sent the money. I told them I understand that but by you allowing this to happen you are allowing people to scam other people. I've filed several complaints in regards to the claim being closed. The last phone call the woman just talked right over me to tell me the same thing I have heard a million times by now. I understand that Wells Fargo didn't take money from me. But they allow people who commit fraud to use them as a bank and take money from other people. They don't protect their clients. I am extremely frustrated with them. They state using XXXX is like going to a bank and taking out money and handing it to someone. But it is not. It is an online wire transfer. I have read several different people who did get scammed and got their money back through XXXX. I also had a friend of ours that banked with XXXX that was scammed and used XXXX and got a full refund. The other I read online on your website the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. That person reached out to you and you helped them get a refund through Wells Fargo. So I'm hoping that you can help me out as well. The only reason I felt safe using XXXX was because it was through my bank Wells Fargo and that I thought they would back me up and keep me safe. They repeatedly have told me they will not help me. I finally received in the mail the official paper stating my claim was closed on XX/XX/XXXX, even though it is dated XX/XX/XXXX. I was just on XXXX XXXX XXXX today at XXXX regarding this scam."
337,"In XX/XX/XXXX, around XXXX my phone was taken. I can not be sure as to who took it but shortly after they sent payments in order of {$500.00}, {$1000.00}, {$1000.00}, {$500.00}, {$1000.00}, and {$1000.00} using the debit card set up in my XXXX XXXX. These payments all occurred between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. They originally tried to send {$1000.00} on the first payment but Wells Fargo declined and sent a text/email to verify. Since they had my phone they were able to respond to the verification text and now had access to my funds. Lastly, they tried to send {$2500.00} with the last payment but that was declined due to my daily spending limit being exceeded. Ultimately they got away with my phone and the {$5000.00} sent via XXXX XXXX  from Wells Fargo. 

I have attached the emails I received from Wells Fargo about the activity, my phone was stolen so I do not have access to the texts. I also attached the replacement phone confirmation from my phone insurance to prove my phone was indeed stolen and used to send money without my consent."

347,"It all started when I met a girl ( her name is XXXX, supposedly from XXXX, lives in USA in XXXX Oregon ), she started flirting with me and XXXX XXXX XXXX After a while, she told me about investing and cryptocurrency and trading profits. XXXX interested me and invited me to trade with her. 
On XX/XX/2022 at first I started with {$100.00} and then she asked me to invest more, putting pressure on me and I agreed. 
On XX/XX/2022, I invested {$1000.00} XXXX with commissions and the purchase transaction was about {$1200.00} XXXX. 
I started making a profit on a small investment. 
I liked the idea of profit, the lady asked to take a loan to get more money to invest. But I told her I had some savings and on XX/XX/2022, I put down {$710.00} to add more funds. 
I wanted to have at least {$2000.00} in my account, so I added {$250.00}. 
On XX/XX/2022, I deposited XXXX XXXX, which cost me {$5100.00}. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, I deposited XXXX XXXX for about {$2100.00}. My friend insisted that I put in more money to have a decent amount as capital, so I bought XXXX, which is the equivalent of {$9200.00}. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I bought another XXXX, so my XXXX  account grew nicely. 
I continued to buy more, on XX/XX/2022, I bought XXXX equivalent to {$5000.00}, and sent it to XXXX XXXX, all purchases, and deposits were from my debit card from Wells Fargo to XXXX XXXX XXXX 
The problems started when I tried to withdraw funds from the XXXX XXXX, they asked for 15 % taxes on my assets, which were approximately XXXX XXXX equal to the XXXX XXXX I sent on XX/XX/2022. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX win asked for 10 % of my XXXX  for verification, threatening to freeze my account if I didn't send the money. So I sent them XXXX XXXX = XXXX USD, apparently, the verification failed because of my ID. After waiting to "" verify '' my account, they sent me a message saying that my account was under investigation because of my income, and that in order to verify it and get it back to normal and as proof of my innocence I needed to send XXXX. This happened on XX/XX/XXXX, I was chatting with my friend and she told me that I should do what they were asking, So I used all my savings and retirement money to send them XXXX. I sent them XXXX about {$20000.00} XXXX dollars, to my surprise they told me that since I had sent an incomplete payment I needed to send them another XXXX to complete the check, which I did the same day. The next day I was waiting for a message from them, and they sent me an email saying that the XXXX headquarters did not accept the verification because I had sent them XXXX in installments. 
They offered to do the final verification by sending XXXX in one payment. I contacted my friend and she told me that I had to send the money or my account would be blocked. I sent the money by wire transfer on XX/XX/2022, because that was the only way I could do it. 
After trying to withdraw my money several times with no success, I understood that I made the mistake and I fell victim to a scam. 
After the incident, I tried to contact Wells Fargo and draw their attention to the fact that the transactions made from my bank account should have been regarded by the bank as suspicious and similar to fraud. The task of the bank in such cases is not only to store my funds but also to protect them. But my requests were rejected"

My Wells Fargo and XXXX apps both had autosaved usernames and were able to be accessed through facial recognition for the password. Between the 2 accounts ( all were out through Wells Fargo ), {$3400.00} was transferred out via XXXX over the next week after I had been assaulted and robbed. I have submitted now 3 claims with Wells Fargo to recoup the money and each denial I am told a different bogus reasoning for denial. First denial stated it was through a secure login session and was authorized by me. That makes 0 sense as I had a police report to show the phone was not in my possession and the assailants had access to my routing/account numbers so had free reign. I was not told by Wells Fargo to change my account or routing number either when phone was stolen ( Seems ridiculous I know ). I  resubmitted a second claim with a banker at a local branch this time around and was denied for the EXACT same reason as before and added there was a one time  passcode that provided authorization. Again, a one time passcode was sent to the same phone that was documented as stolen and they knew that. How does that even make sense? This allowed one last transfer to occur as well. Lastly, I submitted 3rd claim with a bank manager at a different location. They escalated it to the apparent  highest fraud team level they could and was even told by them it should have been overturned in my favor. They came back with another bogus reasoning. I am a XXXX year old who does not have a lot of money to begin with and being out {$3400.00} is a huge deal and has caused a great deal of stress and personal issues as well. Below I have created a timeline of the exact dates and what happened. I also have the amounts listed with the transfer dates. I have documentation including police report, wells fargo denial letters, and proof of visiting bank locations twice if needed for more help that are attached. The police report is to show the phone was stolen as they are claiming there was continued access to phone. The report does not have the money transfers listed as they happened after the report had already been created. I am working with an attorney to create a new report regarding the actual money transfers if it gets to that.

356,"I tried to use our flight credits on XXXX and logged in on my account. Upon trying to book our trip, it didn't finalize. Instead the customer service number came up to call. So I called the number. It was XXXX customer service number but the wait time was 30 min. There was an option for call back. So I chose to call back. 30 Min later, XXXX agent called, who was a scammer and I had no idea he was a scammer. He could pull out my itinerary and knew all the passengers I was gon na book. He said the reason it didn't go through was my credits were expired but he can refund the whole amount to my credit card and I have to create a new booking at the same time to pay for this new booking. I used my bank app to send money ( 4 transactions for {$1800.00} ) through my bank app XXXX which I never heard. He told me how to do. After the XXXX transaction and hanged up the phone, he never sent me an itinerary. Then I realized I was scammed. 
I called the bank, the banker opened my case up to investigate but the bank is unable to guarantee my credits back. 
Please examine if my case will qualify to be covered by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E."
357,"On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I received a text message notifying me of an attempted transaction for {$250.00}, Reply Yes or No ( see attachment ). I responded No and waited on the call from Wells Fargo as stated in the text. 

Within 10 minutes I received a call at XXXX, from a woman who identified herself as "" XXXX '' with Wells Fargo Bank 's online security and there had been suspicious activity from my account. The call dropped and I thought it was a good idea to confirm that the number "" XXXX '' called from was indeed a Wells Fargo number and when I called the numberback, the recording was a Wells Fargo greeting and menu. 

"" XXXX '' called me back from that same toll free number while I was on the other line, so this did give me some assurance that I was on the phone with a WF representative. 

"" XXXX '' went on to validate my account with my address telephone number and the last four of my debit card I refuse to give her the last four of my Social Security number. I am an XXXX  of 30 years in the XXXX XXXX  and this is simply PII that I will not Give anyone over the phone. Upon validation that this was my account ( including a text message she triggered with a code for verification ) "" XXXX '' went on to list the suspicious transactions as follows : ( 1 ) XXXX XXXX who was sent {$190.00} - I do not know anyone by the name of XXXX XXXX. In addition, an email address for XXXX XXXX Email address was added to my XXXX recipients and the app and I don't even know this person XXXX XXXX, no do I recognize the email address, nor did I add this person to my list of XXXX recipients. This was 100 % fraudulent. 

( 2 ) 2 XXXX transfers in the amount of {$2000.00} and {$1000.00} were made to XXXX XXXX, an existing recipient, who is my hair stylist and relative. I said absolutely not, these were not authorized transactions. I advised that I have a XXXX transaction history that reflects a consistent {$320.00} to {$350.00} paid to XXXX but NEVER would I XXXX her that much money. IMPORTANT TO NOTE : The transactions were made before the call. I did not authorize XXXX 's to go out to anyone, specifically XXXX {$3000.00} and XXXX XXXX for {$190.00}. 

"" XXXX '' advised me that the fastest way to get my funds back would be to call XXXX and get her to send the funds back to me. "" XXXX '' stated that otherwise they would need to freeze XXXX account with her bank until we tracked the funds. 



I was able to text and got XXXX on a 3-way call. XXXX at first stated that she wasn't aware whether she had received XXXX transfer from me or not and was too busy to notice. {$3000.00} and too busy to notice????? Okay.XXXX 

I was placed on hold while XXXX looked at her phone and confirmed that yes, she did see the XXXX transactions and would send them back. XXXX text me a print screen from her account transactions showing that a {$3000.00} XXXX had been sent to an account under my name in bold. Later a larger XXXX receipt was sent that would show my name XXXX XXXX at the top but under my name it states in light gray font Enrolled as XXXX XXXX  see attachments ). Wherever XXXX sent these funds to it was not my account. I contacted XXXX and was told the "" Enrolled as '' reflects the account holder 's name enrolled s that XXXX 's recipient. In emails from my XXXX, she also confirmed the funds were sent to a XXXX account. 



When XXXX stated she sent the funds back I attempted to login to my WF app to confirm and XXXX told me it was disabled and she would confirm. While on hold and within 3 minutes I received pings to my phone but could not see the texts. Once XXXX was released from the call I could pull up the texts which were automated confirmations texts for transactions - a XXXX setup in my name from XXXX ( I DO NOT BANK WITH XXXX  ), notification of a XXXX deposit of {$3000.00} from XXXX into the XXXX account and then a notification canceling XXXX access through the fraudulent XXXX XXXX  account. All of this was done in 3 minutes - between XXXX and XXXX ( see texts messages ). 



At this point XXXX comes back to the line and confirms that the money was in my Wells Fargo account. However, through her access to my account, XXXX transferred {$3000.00} from my savings and checking and it made it appear the funds were redeposited. This was a blatant attempt to confuse the transaction as refunded, when it was not. The thieves used my very own funds to fake me out and see a {$3000.00} credit/deposit to my checking account. I made no such transfer and could not as my Wells Fargo access was locked. This is clearly fraud. 



XXXX went on to say that she was canceling my debit card and issue a new one, and I would need to change my login info for the application. I stayed on the line with XXXX and she told me that XXXX could get off the line, now that the funds were back in my account and that they would not have to freeze XXXX account. This is the last time I have spoken with her which was the day of the incident on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX has Been very stoic and rude in her text responses and refuses to take my calls. Instead of simply contacting her bank to trace where the XXXX transactions went to and file a fraudulent complaint she has refused to cooperate and it has caused serious unrest in my family because I am not sure whether or not shes involved. Her mother, XXXX XXXX, and my XXXX XXXX have promised to have XXXX file a fraud claim with her bank and provide records tracing her XXXX transaction since XX/XX/XXXX. I have not received one document to date from XXXX. For this reason she is identified in the police report that I filed for this incident. 



For weeks I called Because I have not had any negative activity or issues at all with my bank accounts and because of my positive history of banking with Wells Fargo I was sure that this would be taken care of with brevity. I woke the next morning to find that the {$3000.00} had not been returned to my account and I called Wells Fargo and spoke with the kindest gentleman XXXX. At that point XXXX advised me that there was no record of the conversation that I referenced with the person XXXX and that it appeared that this had not been a Wells Fargo employee who contacted me. XXXX would go on to cancel both my affected savings and checking accounts, issue new bank account numbers and a new debit card. XXXX assured me that he was putting in for temporary credit of {$3100.00} to my account. He told me that it should be there by the end of business. I thanked XXXX, got off the line and waited until the next day, still no deposit. I continued to call back for days and, on XX/XX/XXXX, I was finally told by a manager after escalating the call that XXXX indeed had put in for the credit but that his manager had gone in behind him and canceled the request. I was told that there have been attempts to call me to advise me of this but there are no missed calls from Wells Fargo. Attempted calls just simply did not happen ... attempts to reach out to me just simply didn't happen. No one reached out to call me and advise me of anything at one of the most critical points for me financially that I faced in years. And all I needed was the support of my bank. Instead I got contentious, argumentative, nasty and snide behavior from a list of reps that I will also provide at the end of this email. 



I continued to escalate the call and spoke with XXXX in the ExecutivXXXX offices on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked XXXX for the documentation they had on the transaction. I was told it would take 30 days to received the "" proof of documentation. '' This went on until I received a letter on the XXXX stating that Wells Fargo declined the claim and stated that it was an authorized transaction for my phone. I have stayed it from the beginning that this was an unauthorized transaction. All three were unauthorized transactions from my account. I've stated this from the beginning. The only thing that I authorized was for XXXX to return my money and to be sent to me as reimbursement for the unauthorized XXXX sent to her. The major point here ... THESE WERE UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS AND I RECEIVED A CALL FROM A FRAUDULENT IMPOSTER POSING AS A WELLS FARGO EMPLOYEE WITH YOUR PROTOCOLS. I never initiated or attempted to send XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX funds. 



I continued to call and text XXXX for days even speaking with my aunts and I was promised that I would receive confirmation of where the funds were sent to and that she would set up a fraud transaction report with her bank. I never received anything from XXXX any information at all. At this point, it is the first of the month I am losing it because now I'm having to liquidate stocks to cover my overhead. I am due to start a new job XX/XX/XXXX after my Non-QM mortgage employer closed in XXXX, so this had a huge impact. 



Still, with no answers, I went to XXXX XXXX  on XXXX XXXX, and was told that it indeed appears the money was sent to XXXX and I received the XXXX notification for a XXXX account. While there I spoke with XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, Private Client Banker, who spent hours trying to get to the bottom of it. XXXX XXXX simply asked why XXXX would not come in or call in and set up a fraud trace on the XXXX transaction to "" my account ''. I advised her that XXXX refused and she stated that would be the only way for her to find out additional information. XXXX XXXX did set up a fraud report on a shell of a profile found in their system that I never set up, so someone did use my PII likely from my hacked phone to set up a XXXX  account because I used our old address. 



The only source of any insight into the final resting place for the {$3000.00} is XXXX, who refuses to respond or look into the transaction so hopefully the police report will push that process along. 



Later I went to XXXX  and the representative, XXXX XXXX XXXX took a look at my phone to see if it had been hacked and to our horror, there were external devices installed onto my phone basically cloning all my activity. I received texts for apps like XXXX that they attempted to access and use. The thieves attempted to access everything. Under my settings there were shadow programs on my phone that had not been downloaded from the app store but were attached to my phone as phantom apps that only showed in black-and-white. The apps were for XXXX XXXX or access which I do not have access to download, and XXXX XXXX. The rep and I went on to deduce that the email address input into my Wells Fargo app was for XXXX which would likely correspond to the set up information for that XXXX XXXX account used to hack my XXXX. Yet Wells Fargo has done nothing to even look at that information and I've told everyone that I spoke to. My phone records for XX/XX/XXXX through the XXXX appear to be completely wiped from my call logs, so I will have to have the police officer request my phone records that pinged off the tower and I was given an XXXX number for that ( highlighted on XXXXXXXX  email ) and was told thats the only way that additional information can be provided on my calls during this period,. I'm waiting on the detective assigned to my case to request that. 

Attached, please find copies of the text message, ( 16 ), the email from XXXX and their contact information ( very helpful to speak with XXXX ), and the police report. The phone logs will follow. 

Additional details. 

I requested documentation that was used to make the decision to not refund me for these XXXX transactions its labeled a Right to Documentation package that I requested on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and I just received it on XX/XX/XXXX. In this documentation the transaction that specifically took place on XX/XX/XXXX, the date of the scam fraud transactions, The information shows that the transactions were made from other states while I was sitting right here in my den in XXXX Georgia. I have bracketed all of the transactions that are of concern and would like to discuss these because there is no way that this could be correct Im showing that advisories they were new IP address and new devices were used to access my account with a Location change within 24 hours. There are failed fill password attempts, marked as enhanced failed password. The transaction cities are as follows XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. XXXX, XXXX, Texas, XXXX Pennsylvania I mean wow I would need magical powers for the transaction attempts jump from state to state.city to city the same day! Please note the report indicates the following activity that clearly indicates fraud : a new IP address, a new city new New IP address location change XXXX hours new device new device another new device another new device This is proof of obvious fraud. I cant seem to get a callback from XXXX or anyone so its got a move to the next step because I need my money. I have attached pages of the report that are of concern please review and have someone contact me. XXXX. 

I opened my first 2 accounts with Wells Fargo in XXXX. I have not had any NSF ( 1 in error - overdraft from my savings account was not set up properly by the bank ). I have been an excellent account holder and I have no issues with my account that should red flag me. This was clearly fraud, and it was a slap in the face that, after years managing my account with an average balances of at least $ XXXX - $ XXXX, I stand here BANKING WHILE XXXX @ WELLS FARGO accused of lying and told in writing that I authorized these transactions. To add insult to injury, YOU HAVE A FRAUD WARNING NOW ON YOUR APP THAT WARNS ACCOUNT HOLDERS ABOUT THIS VERY SCAM. 

I need help. I need my money to pay my bills. I am liquidating stocks to hold me over so I am compounding the financial impact/injury as I am also due to close on my home by the end of XXXX. The security on my Wells Fargo accounts have been the worst I have experienced. I was a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX account holder for over 20 years and when faced with 1 fraud incident in that entire period, I felt totally supported by the bank and they walked me through with direction and suggestion. 

Wells Fargo Bank has abandoned me ... I AM BANKING WHILE XXXX @ WELLS FARGO. I have been told by people like XXXX XXXX, "" to get it from your cousin, sister or whatever she is. '' I was spoken to as if I were some XXXX XXXX, not an account holder. XXXX cut me off and I could not speak during the call, and she repeatedly screamed at me on the call ( please review the call on XX/XX/XXXX ). The abject disregard, disrespect and sheer failure to perform her job has left me facing liquidation of my assets for yet another month, instead of my bank working with me to get to the bottom of it. The bank staff has failed me. Wells Fargo has failed me in a case that is clearly fraud to the police and all banking personnel I speak to in person with both Wells Fargo and XXXX. 

THIS IS A CASE OF BANKING WHILE XXXX AT WELLS FARGO. The hang ups, the XXXX  slang and too familiar manner in which XXXX spoke to me, the way I was spoken down to... i never expected humiliation on top of the theft of funds I have experienced. I have been victimized yet again ... by Wells Fargo Bank. I will release a narrative with grave details of the recorded calls with your staff. I think you would find those cringe-worthy. Right now, I want to complete my concerns and do my all to get my money."
359,"On XX/XX/2021 ( XXXX XXXX  ) I was contacted by a phone number that my XXXXXXXX XXXX caller ID identified as Wells Fargo, my bank. The number was ( XXXX ) XXXX. The caller identified himself as a representative from Wells Fargo and said there had been a potentially fraudulent money transfer from my account, and that I needed to take steps to reverse it. The caller asked me to log into my account using the Wells Fargo app, which I did. The caller talked me through the process of sending a money transfer of {$1500.00} to myself, which I was told would fix the problem. 
This seemed strange and suspicious, so I asked to caller to explain exactly why this action was necessary on my end. His answer wasn't satisfactory, so I stopped the process and did not complete the transfer, hanging up on the caller. At no point did I give any sensitive information to the fraudster. 
Shortly after the call, I checked my bank balance and {$1500.00} was missing, despite my not completing the process. Ibelieve the fraudster was able to hack my account or phone and complete the process on his end by some method, perhaps explaining why he insisted on my using the app. ( He did have the technology to trick my caller ID. ) I called Wells Fargo at XXXXXXXX XXXX to report the fraud. It is clear the transfer was made AFTER I got off the phone withthe fraudster but BEFORE I called Wells Fargo. Out of an abundance of caution, they said, I had to close my checking account immediately and open a new one. This had, for me, the unintended consequence of making it now impossible for me to verify more details about the transfer since that account is now closed and I can not view it online. 
Wells Fargo has refused to replace the money. CFPB regulation ( 12 CFR Part 1005 ) states that the bank is required to replace the {$1500.00} because I did not give the fraudster and personal info. I was not scammed, I was defrauded, and this theft is the legal responsibility of Wells Fargo and they are hiding behind the lack of a paper trail and the obvious flaws in the security of their online services."
361,"I was scammed of {$350.00} after I received an email stating that in order for me to upgrade my XXXX account to a XXXX business account I had to send {$350.00} to a XXXX agent. The emails were structured as a XXXX email and the fraud/ scam artist was impersonating a XXXX  agent. 

Filed several times already and no one has been able to help me. I work hard for my money and I was scammed of {$350.00}. Money that could be going to my family and expecting baby. I filed this claim the day the incident happened so I don't know why the money wasn't stopped or retracted as soon as I sent it. Instead the process has been dragged XXXX months. Wells Fargo has a policy where the supposedly protect their customers from incidents such as this one, but they have done little to nothing to help me. This is the first time a situation such as this one happened to me and my own XXXX bank is unable to protect me from things like this. MY OWN XXXX  BANK IS UNABLE TO PROTECT ME FROM FRAUDS AND SCAMS."
362,"I have attached a full written statement of events with this submission. 

I was a victim of bank fraud on XX/XX/2021. I was contacted by text message about potential fraud and then received a call from the official Wells Fargo phone number. The impersonator on the phone already knew my name, phone number and that I was a Wells Fargo customer, and possibly more Information. I never once at any time gave this person any Information, including codes etc. They walked me through sending money to myself through the XXXX portion of Wells Fargo 's website. I used my own name and phone number which they were somehow able to divert the funds to a XXXXXXXX XXXX account ending in XXXX. When they hung up and I realized what had occurred, I IMMEDIATELY disputed the transaction and contacted Wells Fargo. After almost a week of talking to various people on the phone and bankers in person, and having to reopen and escalate the case, I have not once received any correspondence with Wells Fargo, though they have attempted to deny liability described to me through a banker. Again, I never once shared any information with the fraudster, and they already had my name and phone number which they used to divert the funds."
363,"I was a Victim of the "" XXXX XXXX Scam '' Wells Fargo has denied my claim, claim number XXXX.

364,"On XX/XX/XXXX, an XXXX on XXXX, XXXX, messaged me saying her client wanted a portrait of me for {$2000.00}, and I would get 30 % of the money. She told me her client would email me the check, and I would have to deposit it and then transfer the rest of the money through XXXX. When I asked her why I had to transfer the money and deposit the check, she said it was because "" my XXXX account isn't working. '' On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a check by email from XXXX XXXX ( the client ) for {$1800.00}. Once I deposited the check in my account, I thought the money in my account was secured, so I transferred {$1200.00} to a lady called XXXX XXXX, supposedly XXXX 's friend. A few hours later, she messaged me saying her client wanted to have another portrait of me for {$1000.00}. I proceeded to tell her I only wanted one painting done because transferring the money was too complicated. The next day I got an email from my bank saying the check was returned. I messaged XXXX but got no reply, and she deleted her account. She clearly knew what she was doing by taking advantage of my trust and manipulating me into sending her the money. When I checked my account, I had only {$110.00} left in my account, and I couldn't breathe. I didn't understand how my account balance went from {$2600.00} to {$110.00} within a couple of days. On XX/XX/XXXX, I immediately called the bank and was able to talk to a lady at Wells Fargo. I explained to her everything that happened, and she filed a claim to the Wells Fargo XXXX department and told me they would be investigating and asking me more questions within five business days. I also do not know if I can get any of my money back, and it terrifies me. Not only was I a victim of fraud I was also charged {$15.00} for a purchase I never made, so they had to cancel my account, and I am waiting to receive a new debit card. On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the police station to try and file a claim that I was a victim of fraud however, the police officer told me, "" since the fraud happened online, we can't do much about it, so you need to report to the FBI, and I am sorry this happened to you, but you are not alone.

366,"Dear Sir or Madam, Not only do I wish to file ANOTHER complaint against Wells Fargo, if the CFPB refuses to help me, I would also like to file a complaint against the CFPB for blindly taking Wells Fargo 's side and not doing its due diligence in investigating and rectifying this matter. 

Facts : 1. Mr. XXXX XXXX is my ex-spouse and has an account with Wells Fargo, I do not. 
2. Mr. XXXX cashed a check issued to he "" & '' I ( two-payee check ), by the US Treasury/IRS for a mix-up involving Schedule C on my joint XXXX tax return. 
3. The XXXX Tax return was filed jointly while still married to Mr. XXXX. 
4. The check was made out to XXXX XXXX XXXX & XXXX XXXX 5. The amount of the check was {$6600.00} 6. The IRS mailed the check directly to Mr. XXXX 's address, not the address on the tax return 7. Mr. XXXX stole the full amount of the refund check ( {$6600.00} ) 8. I did not authorize, approve, or sign the check and was unaware that it even existed. 
9. I did not receive even 1 cent of the {$6600.00} amount 10. I  physically handed Wells Fargo a copy of the US Treasury check ( front and back ), on XXXX XXXX, XXXX to XXXX XXXX and the XXXX, NJ Branch Manager, XXXX XXXX. 
11. I have received numerous letters from Wells Fargo, and they have yet to help me. 
12. Both NJ and NY Attorney General detective and attorney ( respectively ), as well as the Taxpayer Advocate Service, as well as Wells Fargo employee have confirmed that Mr. XXXX committed a crime in cashing the 2-payee check without my signature. 
13. There are no signatures on the check. The checked may have been cashed via mobile app or ATM. 
14. Wells Fargo is negligent, in that, they failed to audit and monitor electronic/mobile transactions and therefore, failed to recognize this crime. 
15. Wells Fargo asked me for a copy of the check ( provided twice ), and the date and location which the check was cashed ( how would I know this? ). 
16. Wells Fargo refuses to help me and has failed to rectify the matter. I received communication from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ; not once did they provide any evidence which would have indicated that they were doing anything to resolve the situation. 
17. The CFPB closes my Wells Fargo complaint cases each time I file one ; this is simply an injustice. 
18. I have am consulting with an Attorney, will notify Law Enforcement and the appropriate Prosecutor 's Office. 

I have been ignored dismissed by Wells Fargo, and now the CFPB and consider this mistreatment. You are supposed to be working to protect consumers. However, you are simply allowing Wells Fargo to trample over law-abiding citizens. I am again, asking for your help. Please assist me, as I am certain that I am not the only consumer who has been ignored, put off, and mistreated. I have attached a copy of the check, and the latest communication which I mailed to them certified priority, via the USPS on XX/XX/XXXX. I have given all of the information which I have."
367,"XX/XX/2020 I went to make a mobile deposit. I have been trying to make this same mobile deposit every month for as long as Wells Fargo has installed Mobile banking. As normal I could not make the deposit. So I decided to walk to the branch. As I arrived the branch was closed to walk ins but you could make an appointment. I decided to walk through the drive thru. They would not take me at the drive - thru. I then called WF to see how I could deposit my checks. They told me that I could not, unless I made an appointment or drove a car. I could not make an appointment and I did not have a car so could not drive up. I then walked home. When I arrived at home I called WF to try to get a mobile deposit completed or withdraw my funds from the bank. They could not administer either a withdrawal of my funds nor a deposit. So I can not complete any banking with WF. I was in XXXX OR last week and I could enter the WF bank and complete my banking, in Texas which is a State that is open I can not walk into a bank. So I can not put money in or out. My money is locked."

I was immediately suspicious and called XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). I asked if I would be protected if I never received my concert tickets. The XXXX rep stated that I had two hours to cancel the transaction, so I thought I was protected. I sent {$240.00} electronically to the seller who had a Wells Fargo Account. I transferred the money using XXXX, which was recommended by the seller. Once the money was sent over, the seller stopped all communication with me, and the tickets were NEVER sent. I immediately called XXXX back and was told the seller picked up the funds and there was no way for me to cancel the transaction. 

I opened up case # : XXXX with XXXX ; however, I was horrified to learn the that Wells Fargo would need permission from the seller to take back the money, that was stolen from me."
374,"I was victim of a scam due to a person posing as a delivery service who wanted funds in order for a package to be delivered to me from overseas. A total of {$8900.00} funds were transferred via XXXX, XXXX, and wire transfer. On XX/XX/2022 transaction of {$1500.00} and {$1900.00}. On XX/XX/2022 transaction of {$500.00}. On XX/XX/2022 transaction of {$1200.00} and {$3700.00}. Wells Fargo Bank will not return funds due to dispute is not valid via 3rd party, XXXX since it was not a "" transaction error ''. Some other transactions are under investigation still but all funds should be returned due to being a victim of a scam, which the bank should be understanding of the situation. There should be a better resolution instead of informing their client that there is no transaction error so funds can not be returned."
378,"We responded to an ad on craigslist for a rental house at the address above. We set up an appointment with someone named XXXX XXXX XXXX to go look at it at XXXX on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. When we arrived, he wasn't there and was told to set up an account on rently.com in order to access the key inside a lock box to view the house. 

We wanted to go ahead with the rental and that's when XXXX said we needed to XXXX him the deposit of {$1200.00} to take it off the market. We thought he was sending us paperwork in the meantime, but he wasn't. There was a limit of {$500.00}, so that's what we sent. We told him no more money until we have a contract signed. XXXX wanted us to send the rest of the money via XXXX, but XXXX would not allow us to send more the same day. He sent us the application finally. 
When we noticed the application did not match any of the information associated with the listing, we left and went straight to Wells Fargo as XXXX continued to call us. We demanded our money back, he said we had to finish our application. We did not send back any application. He sent us the application form via XXXX. The subject of the email said, XXXX XXXX. 

At Wells Fargo, they said the only way to resolve this was over the phone, unfortunately. We immediately called Wells Fargo and XXXX ( through WF ). After multiple transfers, we finally filed an investigation claim with the Online Fraud department of Wells Fargo with XXXX. ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I even tried to request a payment back from XXXX via XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX and it was immediately denied. 
Next we called XXXX PD and they never picked up the phone. We even called XXXX PD and were transferred back to XXXX PD and they never picked up. ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I followed up with WF 5 days later ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and they said they could not retrieve the funds from the recipient 's account as of today. Because of that, there was nothing else they could do. If they had tried when we initially called on XX/XX/XXXX, they probably could have retrieved the funds. They just chose not to. 

Now we are out {$500.00} and still do not have a place to move to."
379,"I made a XXXX transfer in the amount of {$400.00} on the Wells Fargo XXXX app, then the Wells Fargo app duplicated that and made two separate transfers of said amount. The transactions had identical confirmation numbers. When I filed a claim on XX/XX/2021 I was told to wait 10 business days but before the 10th business day the confirmation number of one of the transactions was changed making it look like it was not a duplicate error from their end. I followed up with them twice now and even escalated it to a 'higher level ' as the Wells Fargo representatives called it. They still refuse to refund me for their mistake."
380,"On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I received a text message from XXXX stating they were Wells Fargo Security asking "" Did you use your debit card ending in XXXX at : XXXX XXXX, {$10.00} Declined, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  {$15.00} Approved, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX PAYMENT, {$3500.00} Approved, XX/XX/XXXX If you recognize this activity, reply YES If not, reply NO STOP to end text I then replied NO and immediately received a call from XXXX at XXXX from a customer service representative stating she was with Wells Fargo security . Asking me if I made these transaction and I then proceeded to tell her NO. She said she would cancel my debit card immediately and issue me a refund of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX charge. She then said the XXXX PAYMENT XXXX was approved but had not gone through yet and that I needed to reverse the transaction by sending the money back to myself. She sent me a text message from the Wells Fargo number ( XXXX ) at XXXX XXXX with a 6 digit code that I usually receive text messages from Wells Fargo and instructed me to login and give her the 6 digit code. She then told me that the XXXX payment was going to someone named XXXX XXXX and asked did I know them. I stated NO. She said that I'd need to login to XXXX and change my phone number back over to my name and send the money back to myself in which I did. She said to give it 15 minutes and I should see the charge made to my account I did not so I called Wells Fargo back immediately ( XXXX ). They then told me that that wasn't them and that that was a scam and that somehow their number was hijacked. They immediately deactivated my card and filed two claims 1 ) for the approved amount of XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX and 2 ) for the fraudulent XXXX transaction of XXXX. The XXXX was refunded but they denied the fraudulent XXXX transaction of XXXX"

In early XX/XX/XXXX we noticed a few checking account transactions for less than {$1.00}. These were quickly followed by two withdrawals of {$1000.00} and {$1500.00}. We immediatly notified Wells Fargo of this theft and the account was frozen and a new account established. The stolen funds have been refunded. Within a week of the thefts there were five {$300.00} thefts via XXXX from the new checking account to the same person. We didn't request these transfers and do not know the person to whom the funds were transferred hence didn't get our usual notice from Wells Fargo of these five XXXX transactions. There was also an unsuccessful attempt to take funds from our home equity account. I immediaely filed a police report with XXXX and it is an active case, XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo refuses to refund the {$1500.00}. 
We have met 4 times with representatives at the local bank branches, two hours each. ( names and dates available ) Their only action was to submit a complaint to their XXXX XXXX XXXX Office. We met 5 different people on the phone for hours from XXXX XXXX XXXX Office.They also told us that we should feel fortunate that we only lost {$1500.00} as they see so many customers who loose everything. After the 2nd letter of rejection and decision to not refund the {$1500.00}, I requested a meeting with an area vice president. The bank manager said that the meeting could only be set up by the XXXX XXXX Dept. When speaking to the XXXX XXXX Dept, ( names/dates available ) they told me that only the local branch manager could arrange that meeting. XX/XX/XXXX I emailed a note to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of Wells Fargo. No response ( I did not expect anything from him, but certainly from someone who moniters his emails ) Seven days later, I emailed the same note to the XXXX of Wells Fargo. We received a call and spent over an hour on the phone and were told that she would be our advocate and look into the case. She said, at first glance she sees things that appear odd. One week later we received another letter declining any reimbursement. 
We would appreciate any help you can provide to resolve this issue the same way as the theft from our checking account."

386,"I already submitted my claim to CFPB regarding this claim, however Wells Fargo refuses the do the proper investigation to my claim, instead Well Fargo easy way out was to changed the facts and the information given. 
Wells Fargo Bank has been giving me the runaround for the last five months. Well Fargo must need to send the information given to the correct department to do the fraud investigation for the check XXXX XXXX forged the signature to cash the check and also the illegal steps he took to get a hold of this check and the money, Wells Fargo Bank should not be allowed to let this criminal XXXX XXXX to legally scam consumers. 

XXXX XXXX foraged the signature to endorsed the cashier check, cashed at Wells Fargo Bank. XXXX has returned the check and has served a subpoena against Wells Fargo Bank for relevant documents. Despite the check being made payable to a corporation, the check is endorsed as an individual and not on behalf of the named corporate entity, by someone with authority as is required under California law. Moreover, given that Ms. XXXX is named as every officer and sole director, she would be the only individual capable of authorizing any endorsement of the cashiers check. Consequently, without any authorization from Ms. XXXX, this is a fraudulent endorsement perpetrated by XXXX, notwithstanding the check wasnt endorsed as required by California law on behalf of the corporate entity. 
The information provided is squarely relevant to this analysis and shows beyond the fraudulent endorsed check, the larger scheme to defraud Ms. XXXX who is likewise trying to defraud XXXXXXXX XXXX.

387,"my name is XXXX. I have a checking account and credit card at Wells Fargo bank. It was the end of the month, and I was about to make a payment to pay off my Wells Fargo credit card. When I signed in, I saw that my checking account was extremely low, and i was not sure why. I checked to see why. I saw that there was a transaction that was NOT authorized by me. the transaction amount was XXXX dollars. it was a bill pay for a XXXX account. the transaction is described as "" Bill Pay XXXX XXXX   Services on-Line XXXX on XXXX '' .I do NOT have a XXXX  account. I freaked out, because I never made that transaction, so I made a call immediately to the fraud department. They said that they will do an investigation. Wells Fargo sent a message in the mail saying that your claim has been denied, because they were unable to reach me. I went to the local Wells Fargo, and I found out that the phone numbers that were on file were not mine. they re-opened the investigation, and they said "" our research of the transaction shows that it was requested through a secure online banking session using your username and password "". The employee that works in the fraud department told us to try and contact XXXX  to see if they can help you identify the person. We contacted them, and they refused to give us any information, because we do not have an account with them. we went back to the Wells Fargo bank to try and get the phone numbers that was on my account that wasn't mine. They also refused to give us the numbers. Every time we tried to solve the issue, they refused to help us, so they closed the case, and they did not want to re-open the claim. I really need this money. I worked extremely hard for it, and I got nothing out of it. I have a son that needs to go to college, and he needs some of the money."
388,"Last month me and my friend, tried to buy an XXXX throw XXXX. The scammer told us to send XXXX dollars throw XXXX. At the end I did not accept it. Later on I got inside my bank account and I didnt have XXXX dollars, on wells fargo and XXXX XXXX. So I called both banks to report it as a fraud transaction. The next days when my friend told me that he did made the transaction. We went to the police station, we contacted XXXX but they told they would not be able to do anything. 

At the same time XXXX XXXX answered me saying that they could not process my claim so I would not get my money back. I expected the same from Wells Fargo. So we did not change our claim. 

Days pass and we recieved an answer from wells fargo saying they would not be able to refund me the money. 

So this is my last option."
389,"On XXXX XXXX 2021, I received an auto text alert on my phone that asked me to authorize a XXXX transfer to a persons account that I did not recognize/initiate myself. I responded NO to the text, and immediately received a call on my phone that read as "" WELLS FARGO '' on the caller ID ( whom I utilize as my bank ). I answered and spoke with someone who identified themselves as being from the Fraud Department & inquired about the transaction which I perceived as the routine procedure to prevent fraudulent events. I later found out that this person I was speaking to was the scammer themselves & only impersonating someone from my actual Wells Fargo Bank to get my account information/2-step verification details in order to complete the transaction. In doing so, they authorized the transfer and I lost {$4000.00} dollars from my savings account. It has now been over a month of explaining this situation to Wells Fargo yet they continue to refuse to refund my money despite being tricked into doing so at no fault of my own. I did not authorize the payment & have documentation to prove this ( see attached files ). Only when I was deceived into believing I was speaking with representatives from my own bank did I divulge personal account information. This does not constitute personal authorization as they claim on my part, due to the fact that I was fraudulently induced to believe I was working with a trusted source from my own bank. Yet they continue to deny my claim. The scammers fraudulently impersonated both my bank ( Wells Fargo ) & myself by commandeering my account to authorize a transaction I did not consent to. I am asking Wells Fargo to refund the {$4000.00} unlawfully taken from me per my right as a Well Fargo Bank customer & XXXX XXXX protected by Regulation E of the Federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act."
391,"On XX/XX/2019, I logged into my Wells Fargo ( WF ) online account and sent {$100.00} to my sister via their XXXX money transfer function. Per the instructions on WF 's site, my sister should have received a text notifying her of the incoming money transfer and provide her with instructions on how to register her mobile number and bank account in order to receive the funds. My sister never received a text or email notification. I waited 3-4 days to see if perhaps it was delayed, but she never received anything. I asked her to download the XXXX app and set up an account to see if once her mobile # was registered in their system, the funds would come through. My sister set up a profile with XXXX, after waiting 1-2 more days the funds still never came through. 
On XX/XX/2019, I contacted Wells Fargo to inquire about the transfer. I spoke with XXXX who indicated that between the dates of XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/2019, there was a technical issue at XXXX that prevented some money transfers from processing correctly. She then opened a dispute/claim ( # XXXX ) to research the matter and said they should be able to locate the funds and return them to my account. 
On XX/XX/2019, I received the attached letter from Wells Fargo indicating that after researching the matter, they are showing that the funds had been accepted/processed, so they are unable to stop or reverse the funds back to my account. I checked with my sister who confirmed that she had not received the funds. I then called Wells Fargo and spoke with XXXX in their Claims Dept. XXXX reviewed the claim notes and notified me that their research found that the funds were processed and received by a XXXX user, but that the name did not match my sister 's name, the intended recipient. She then stated that perhaps my sister 's mobile # is attached to another customer 's "" token '' and that may be what caused the funds to go to the wrong person, but because the transfer has already been processed, they could not help me any further and that i would need to work with XXXX to research further. My sister has had the same phone # for almost 10 years and she established a XXXX account using that phone #, so i'm not sure how it could be connected to another person/token. 
After speaking with XXXX I contacted XXXX and spoke with XXXX regarding the matter. I conferenced my sister in on the call so that she could verify her XXXX profile information to allow them to confirm if any funds had been received. XXXX confirmed that since setting up her profile on or around XX/XX/2019, no funds have been received. Although he could see that the funds had not been received by my sister, XXXX stated that he had no way to trace the transaction from Wells Fargo to see where the funds went. He then instructed me to work with Wells Fargo to resolve. I called Wells Fargo back and spoke with XXXX (? ) in the Claims dept., and was told the same thing XXXX had told me. He said they have no control over the XXXX application and even though i used Wells Fargo 's website to send the funds, once it's processed they have no means to research further or retrieve the funds and to work with XXXX. Long story short, both Wells Fargo and XXXX keep sending me back and forth between the two institutions stating that neither have the ability to see where the funds went and that neither can refund my money to me. 
All i want is my {$100.00} back. PLEASE HELP!! This has been a terrible customer service experience with both companies. If they are in a partnership together, one would think they would have an established process to resolve incidents like this and the ability to trace the movement of funds from one entity to the other via some type of trace / transit / reference # or something."
393,"On XX/XX/2023, at XXXX I was called by a person who claimed to be a Wells Fargo representative. The person spoofed the call so that it would appear as Wells Fargo and have the correct customer service number.The individual informed me that someone had tried to use my debit card to make various purchases, and that the purpose of this call to keep that from happening. They asked me to verify the codes that was sent to me, which I did under the impression that this was me verifying my identity to protect my account. Shortly after I checked my emails and see several Wells Fargo messages about Wells Fargo wires, new recipient and a wire transfer initiated and pending for XXXX XXXX As soon as I saw this I immediately called Wells Fargo, the time was XXXX. I informed them that I had not initiated this wire transfer and to cancel it/freeze the transaction. I was informed that it was already pending and that there was nothing that could be done besides to open a claim and to request the money back. Over the following days I corresponded via phone with the Wells Fargo fraud department and the claims departments. They said my claim was denied because I "" approved "" the transfer through the codes. And that they requested my funds back from the fraudsters XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX account but there was nothing there. I told them I wanted to appeal my claim denial and was contacted by someone in charge of the claims department on XX/XX/2023, and I explained my situation. That day I was reimbursed the XXXX $ wire charge. On XX/XX/2023 I was called and informed that they would not be able to reimburse me because the money was no longer present in the XXXX account. 
I have made a report with XXXX as well as the FTC"

They proceeded to tell me at XXXX years old I had no choice but to claim bankruptcy knowing they could have stopped those fees and whatever else was taking all my money.
396,On XX/XX/19 I received a call from samone who identified as a family member requesting that I send a XXXX payment. Because I typically send payments to that particular family through others I wasnt reluctant to send the payment. I called that family member on XX/XX/19 concerned that they had not received the funds. At that moment that had advised they never called and it wasnt them that made the request. I immediately called my bank to make them aware and file a dispute. They said that this will be filed and take 10 business days which I was advised no later than XX/XX/19. I have not received any paper work from Wells Fargo not via mail or email regarding my claim. Every time I call Im transferred several times. It pains me to see that my bank is supposed to protect me and yet they havent. Out of the millions of customers Wells Fargo has defrauded they should be more helpful to the customers whos remained loyal to them after all the things that have transpired. Its {$90.00}! Thats not going to XXXX  them to credit a customer who never disputes anything. My cell phone service was turned off over this! I had to do without gas and no one takes this serious. Its sad. I want someone to do something about this!

So we started to wire the money in several XXXX and XXXX wires continuously. Each time a wire was received by the bank they asked us to go there and sign OFAC AFFIDAVIT paper and after a a few days the bank would credited our account, but after all the transferring was done we realized the bank has not credited our total amount of XXXX $ instead they gave us XXXX $ .we waited a few days but no luck. XXXX $ is missing. We have all the ofac affidavit papers that sais in total the amount is XXXX but they say its not a proof! The problem is that we dont know which of these several wires have been credited and which ones havent because they all been continuously sent and very similar amounts. But with further investigation we find 12 possible wires that that could be it, 7 of these 12 havent been credited. We asked the bank to check these 12 ofac affidavit papers because they have reference numbers on them but they are not helping us! Its been a month and we are going back and forth and nothing so far, no one is helping us. 
The bank said maybe theres a problem with the bank in XXXX, but they gave us the ofac papers to sign! So we know that the money is here, but no one seems to know where its gone! And we tried to talk to everyone even in different branches but no one is helping. 
So Im here asking you to help us, we need the rest of the money we are stressed out Could you help us please?"
399,"For the past several years, my Social Security monthly benefit payments have been transferred into my checking account at Wells Fargo Bank on the XXXX  Wednesday of each month.

Recently, under a new service called "" Early Pay Day '' Wells Fargo notified me, in writing, that my Social Security deposit would be available two days earlier than the usual XXXX Wednesday of the month. 
I have banking and financial analysis experience and am a CPA ( Inactive license ). I am concerned that this "" Early Pay Day '' is nothing other than a short term loan from Wells Fargo for which they collect interest. 
Alternately, I am concerned that, for reasons for their own, Wells Fargo is artificially inflating my deposits on had for the sake of their financial statement presentations. With over 85 million customers this could be a huge misleading effort. Based on the news of the past few years, this would not be the first time Wells Fargo has pulled such a stunt. 
If Social Security has not changed their cash availability date, how is Wells Fargo able to make the payment available? As of this morning, my monthly payment shows on my Wells Fargo web site account as "" Pending Deposit. '' Yet the Wells Fargo representative I spoke with assured me the cash was available when it appeared yesterday, two days early. 
Based on their past history of fraudulent activity, I am concerned that Wells Fargo may be trying to perpetuate another scam. Please advise."

Everything he gave me information-wise apparently was made up. 

I called Wells Fargo to have this reversed and they simply stated to me that deep down in their Terms and Conditions for XXXX that if you authorize a payment that you can't have it reversed. That's perplexing to me provided my bank supposedly offers insurance on their accounts / services for scams and fraud on transactions / transfers."

I never signed the withdraw form so Im interested to see if she took XXXX $ from my account anyways. They are blocking me from using my online portal. When I asked for the fee to be waived XXXX lied to her manager stating she asked me to take off my sunglasses and I refused. This is not true. Several of the bankers will make up lies like this to make it look like your being difficult. I was happy to take my glasses off. Nothing to hide. The manager was then rude to me. I notified her of the bank misreporting my funds and she acted like I was trying to get a free money order. 

I explained to her that if I cant trust the bank with my money I needed free money orders to pay my bill. She did not care at all that I reported loss money in my account.

They are 12 weeks 2 days old, presently vet checked, and will come with all papers needed. The puppies are very playful and are all of the absolute temperament as they also love playing with kids and other household animals. Attached to this mail are pictures of the puppies. We are giving the pups out for adoption because they belonged to our late son who was was a breeder but he just passed away after a long term XXXX thus we can't keep all of them as our home pets but we'll keep their parents, so we had to relocate to his home to give these puppies away and some property. I will be very willing to give you these pups if you can promise me never to sell them because they have been like kids to him, also do get back to me with the answers to our question below so I can have an idea of where our puppies will be going to.

All we need from you is your love for the baby.

We just relocated a few days ago to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX where our late son lived. Better still if you can't make it up, they can be registered to a nearby pet 's transportation company and will be home delivered to you okay. All you will have to do is pay for the transportation fee so he will be home delivered to you right at your doorsteps. We are giving the puppies for free since they were owned by our late son for if he was alive today he couldn't have sold them so that is why we are giving them away for FREE and all I want in return is just you to take care of him and send me monthly pictures so we can see his progress.

Thanks MANAGER XXXX XXXX I knew at this point it was a scam. XXXX called me to explain the need for the crate and I stated I was never going to pay thousands of dollars for a crate and I wanted my money refunded. Of course it was not. 

I forwarded the email to the "" supposed owners '' and this was the response. 
Hello XXXX I got the same email and you will have to choose which of the crates you want we can take the last crate which is {$1000.00} refundable please read the email well. 

I responded I will not be paying for any kind of crate. This is their response : Hello XXXX please calm down I just talked with my husband and we are willing to help work this out since the money is refundable we manage to come up with {$800.00} so if you can complete the {$200.00} balance that will be fine since we will be getting the money back. 

I never responded back."
409,I got scammed by someone calling me from XXXX police number to scam me out of XXXX
410,"at XXXX XXXX. XXXX, I used XXXX app to purchase this item. But after I purchased it, I saw the seller has closed his store. I realized I got fraud and then I called wells fargo and contacted with paypal to report this case in the same day I purchased. but the seller proved a fake tracking number which means the tracking number is exist but the delivery address doesn't match with me, the XXXX choosed to trust the frauder and dennied my request.the wells fargo staff promised me they will invetigate this case by 10-15 business days, and gave me a temporiry credit on my card. after a month, there was no any information or notification for me from wells fargo, so I thought the case has done. but after 4 months, the last Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX, my wells fargo account got deduction with no reason, the wells fargo staff told me because they dennied my request, so they reverse the credit. but they had never contacted me before, and they had not asked me for any evidence of being fraudulent with me, and even I could prove that the frauder did not send me anything before. But now that four months have passed, some proof is gone."
411,"Hello, I was scammed on instagram by this lady who said she could invest my funds and give me major profit on my return. The only reason I did this was because I saw somebody I knew do it. However, I gave this person 3 thousand dollars and they were still asking for more. They were asking for another 4 thousand dollars. This was all done in the XXXX app. And I purchased etherium as currency. Im really scared and feel horrible about losing this money. Her XXXX  was @ XXXX. I asked for my money back and she no longer responds."
412,"My husband transferred XXXX XXXX from his XXXX account in XXXX using the correct account number, name and address of an XXXX Checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. 
The funds didn't arrive for some XX/XX/10 days. 

After contacting XXXX they informed me that their checking account can not receive international transfers and the SWIFT code used in his transfer was for receiving international transfers to their brokerage account. E-trade use Well 's Fargo as an intermediary for international transfers - so the XXXX used for the transfer was Wells Fargo 's. 

XXXX informed me that I should ask the sending bank in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to send through the XXXX of the SWIFT transfer for them to track the transfer, which was then sent to them on XX/XX/XXXX. After following up on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX said there was no information on the XXXX that identifies XXXX as the intended beneficiary bank - my husband hadn't included a routing number. 

XXXX then told me to ask the sending bank to recall the transfer as it's probably stuck at the intermediary bank XXXX Wells Fargo XXXX. The sending bank ( XXXX XXXX tried to recall the funds but was unsuccessful - they said we need the beneficiary 's approval. But as the intended beneficiary is me, and I didn't receive the funds in my E-trade account, there is no one to seek approval from. 

The sending bank have said they have done all they can & E-trade have also said they can't talk to Well 's Fargo because there is no identifying code on the XXXX for XXXX. 

So the funds appear to be credited to an account that is not the intended recipient and the intermediary bank is not willing to return back the funds to my husband. 

Hoping that with your help there will be some resolution to this. 
I've included the XXXX with the account number removed showing the XXXX XXXX of Well 's Fargo."
413,"On XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX, I received a phone call with the caller ID showing as Wells Fargo and their phone number XXXX. I got nervous because we have had issues in the past with people hacking into our personal checking account and purchasing items. When this happens Wells Fargo has always called and asked if they were our purchases. We have had to close our credit cards numerous times and even close our personal checking account. Wells Fargo has always been extremely helpful and accommodating every time this has happened and have always reimbursed us our funds that were taken fraudulently. So on XX/XX/XXXX, when I saw Wells Fargo was calling I was already in the mindset that something happened. I answered and a man identified himself as "" XXXX '' and that he worked for Wells Fargo. He told me that someone had hacked into our account and taken {$3000.00} and it went to a TD Bank account. That did not raise any flags because we also have a TD Bank account and that is larger than our Wells Fargo personal account. So he got my attention. He asked if I or my husband had been traveling in XXXX ( I believe ) and if we allowed anyone named "" XXXX '' to use our account. I told him no on both questions. He then said that I needed to use my XXXX account through my Wells Fargo account to make a payment to receive the money. I should have hung up at this point, but I was still thinking about how this has happened in past and I believed I was talking to a Wells Fargo rep and even looked back on my phone to confirm it was a Wells Fargo number. I told him I didn't have a XXXX account. A sidenote, I had heard of XXXX before, but never used or even knew anyone that used this, so I was unaware of the ins and outs of it. He told me I needed to open a XXXX account so I can make sure to receive back the {$3000.00} that was taken from me. He gave me step by step instructions on how to do this. I started it and opened account. He said he sent me a code and that he needed the code from me to make sure I was reimbursed. I received the code and provided him the number. He then told me to pay {$3000.00} to myself via XXXX and that my account would replenish within 24 hours. I started getting nervous, but again believed I was speaking to Wells Fargo and this was legitimate. I should have listened to my inner voice but didn't. I finished the whole process and he said thank you and again reassured me the money would be back in my account within 24 hours. We hung up and I instantly got sick to my stomach and thought I did something wrong. Within 5 minutes I called Wells Fargo and spoke to XXXX in Online Claims and told her what happened. She was kind and told me that there was a influx in "" XXXX Scams ''. I told her that the phone number came over as Wells Fargo- she told me that scammers are getting better at it and able to "" spoof '' the phone number. She told me she opened a claim and within 10 days I would receive the money back. I was instantly relieved! By XX/XX/XXXX, which was 15 days after I first called, I still hadn't heard anything. I called and spoke to XXXX XXXX I believe he was in the Online Fraud dept ) who told me that my claim had been closed on XX/XX/XXXX saying that they would not be reimbursing me any money. He said he would put a note into the claim requesting to reopen it. He then transferred me over to another department which I believe was online customer service or online claims. I then spoke to a woman ( I didn't get her name, I started getting quite emotional and could barely speak ), but asked if she would please reopen my claim. She said she would and instantly reopened it. I asked her what would happen next and she said they would go back through my claim to audit it and it would take another 10 days. I am in need of help to try and get my money back. 

I started googling after hanging up with Wells Fargo and found this on your website : unauthorized EFTs under Regulation E : ( 1 ) a third-party calling the consumer and pretending to be a representative from the consumers financial institution and then tricking the consumer into providing their account login information, texted account confirmation code, debit card number, or other information that could be used to initiate an EFT out of the consumers account, and ( 2 ) a third party using phishing or other methods to gain access to a consumers computer and observe the consumer entering account login information. EFTs stemming from these situations meet the Regulation E definition of unauthorized EFTs. 

This made me believe that your organization could possibly help me in retrieving the money that was taken. Please help!"
415,"I was a victim of the XXXX scam and Wells Fargo is telling me they will not be returning my money. I was scammed {$1000.00} from one account and {$10000.00} from another for a total of 11,000. The scammer called from the customer service number of the bank which I have a screen shot of and stated if I didn't enter the codes provided that a scammer was going to get my money. 
I first got a text asking if I approved a transfer and then I got a call from the banks customer service number so I believed I was talking to the banks fraud dept but in fact it was a scam. By the time I felt uncomfortable they had taken my funds."
422,"Made an online purchase on XXXX-22. XXXX XXXX via Wells Fargo website. I soon discovered that the purchase was fraudulent. Contacted WF for resolution. They opened a fraud claim that was denied for reimbursement on XXXX22. I contacted them again to argue my claim. Agent stated they dont refund these types of transactions!! I deactivated my XXXX account, as I will never use it again for any transactions. It has exposed its nasty underbelly to me!!!"
423,My name is XXXX XXXX I need to make a complaint on a dispute I did withXX/XX/XXXX because I never receive my item and the bank agent telling me I cant dispute it now and other ones from yesterday tell me I can dispute when my transactions are processed to my account now the agents telling me I cant dispute I tell them what the other agents tell me yesterday and I got scammed and I need the {$210.00} claim to be reopened and processed the claim number is XXXX and I need the {$14.00} claim to be refunded too and processed the claim number is XXXX my address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX PA XXXX and contact phone number is XXXX
427,"On XX/XX/XXXX I got a call from someone claiming to be a Wells Fargo representative, claiming there was an attempt to wire {$3500.00} from my checking account to another bank, and I needed to take steps on my wells fargo account to "" return '' the money. The call came from a wells fargo number and the person sounded very professional, etc. They had me log on to my online account and had me take several steps while they were on the phone such that somehow my account sent money to another bank via XXXX in the amount of {$3500.00}. I opened a fraud claim with Wells Fargo and they did an investigation. Although they admitted it was fraud, they would not reimburse me for my loss. This appears to be in violation of CFPB regulations."
429,Someone withdrew {$1600.00} from my checking account using XXXX. I dont use XXXX . Dont know how to use XXXX XXXX Or even what XXXX is. But the money was withdrawn from my account without my permission or knowledge. The bank states I knew about it and I was involved in the withdrawal. This is wrong. I have tried to appeal the decision but was told it can only be reopened with new information. I dont have any new information. I only know it wasnt me or authorized by me. And now Im out the money. I feel like my bank is stealing from me as well. Isnt my money insured. Im not sure what that means but I need my money back.
430,"On XX/XX/2021, I purchased 2 car fenders from a seller on XXXX, named "" Old School Cars and Parts ''. The seller said he only accepted XXXX as a payment option. I hesitated, but was saw that my bank, Wells Fargo, offered XXXX as a payment option, so I assumed it was safe using the bank as the payment option. I sent the amount required, {$470.00} to the company via information on XXXX XXXX, the only way I communicated with him. The next day, the seller requested more money, an alleged {$150.00} "" refundable insurance '' payment for the shipper, with an email to also send a XXXX payment to. I asked him to send me proof of the items even existing, and the shipper 's name, so I could check myself, or refund me the money. No message after that, and now he blocked my messaging to him. of course, the fenders were never shipped, if they even existed. I filed a claim with Wells Fargo, and after 10 days, I called back. They told me the claim was denied, due to me now knowing the other person. They did not care that theft was involved, and that upsets me that Wells Fargo even promotes a service like XXXX. I set up a fake XXXX account, and sent messages to the seller, who is still doing business. He said he never had a problem with anyone using XXXX, and I referred him to my real name 's transaction, and that a refund should be sent or charges would be filed against whoever he was. No comment after that, of course. I think Wells Fargo should help me out a little more with an investigation, or do a courtesy refund to me for {$470.00}, since they still offer XXXX. I have filed a report with the Internet Claims office. I have screen shots of all communication with the seller, even a phone number, as he called me once about the payment and texted me, too. XXXX is no help, as still have "" Old School Cars and Parts '' online, and there is no real way to notify of them of this seller, as he does not use their XXXX marketplace to sell from."
431,"Wells Fargo retirement acct transfer to XXXX in XX/XX/2020. 
I retired at that time and they deducted over {$2000.00}. for the transfer. 
I tried to talk to them and they couldnt support their rationale for such a XXXX  against my retirement monies! 
But I couldnt get them to make it right!! 
Please help since obviously they have practices that are very sketchy! 

Thank you"
432,I sent a wire in the amount of {$5100.00} on XXXX XXXX from my business account with XXXX XXXX to a subcontractors account at Wells Fargo. He never received the funds. After three weeks of tracing the wire. Wells fargo advised the funds where on hold on their side. They requested documentation from my subcontractor which I have provided. It has been over a week and I have placed multiple calls to my bank who then reaches out to wells fargos wire department and they have gotten no where. I recalled the wire a few weeks back and I still dont have my money!
435,"I received a text from Wells Fargo on XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX : "" Free Msg- Wells Fargo Fraud Alert- Did you attempt to do a XXXX transfer for the amount of {$1500.00}? Reply YES to authorize ; reply NO or 1 to decline transaction ''. I've received messages such as this previously, so I responded No and received the following text : "" Thank you for your confirmation case ID XXXX ''. Within minutes I received a call from a Wells Fargo phone number and the guy on the other end was able to convince me to go through with a a XXXX transfer of {$1000.00}. He made me panic and feel like my bank account and information was compromised! He truly sounded like a Wells Fargo employee and they had all of my information. I am young and savvy, use XXXX and XXXX, but I had never heard of XXXX before this day. I immediately opened a fraud case with Wells Fargo, which was denied, though I feel like I should have recourse under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. It is frustrating that it's impossible to know if the bank calls if you're being scammed or not! Further, I don't see any of the letters/ documentation regarding my claim on their online portal, which leads me to believe that they just want consumers to forget about it once denied. I have no idea what steps to take to recover this money"
436,"On XX/XX/2022, I attempted to buy a {$450.00} commodity online from a website called XXXX. After additional conversation regarding the exchange that was meant to occur, the seller barred me on the so-called website on XX/XX/2022, and it became clear that the whole transaction was a fraud. I immediately phoned my bank, since this is where the money transfer firm XXXX, with whom I made the transaction, was integrated. The bank filed a claim, which they regrettably had to close twice, since they believe I made the transfer and there is nothing they can do except wait for the seller 's bank to recover the funds. I understand the circumstances, but it is completely unjustifiable that they lack any kind of protection in this case. I was certain that if something went wrong, I would have some form of protection, given I had used my bank to transmit money. Neither the bank nor XXXX cooperated with me in resolving the problem ; I have images demonstrating that the whole transaction was a fraud, and the seller 's account was even suspended on the platform used, since there were likely many other people who reported it. I have not received an e-mail or physical mail detailing the status of the claim, and I have had to call each time for an update, just to learn that my claim was closed without adequate assessment or notification. You may be aware of the issues with XXXXXXXX XXXX lack of security against these types of situations, and I hope they can find a method to communicate this information to their users."
439,"On XX/XX/21, I paid a person on XXXX titled "" XXXX XXXX '' after I discovered a XXXX group called "" XXXX XXXX for Adoption '' with the admin 's name "" XXXX XXXX. '' I paid the amount of {$880.00} with the promise of a XXXX XXXX being shipped to me on XXXX XXXX XXXX at my nearest airport at XXXX XXXX. We were convinced this puppy existed due to several photos and video verification that he was a real dog. A shipping label was also given to us that tracked the puppy 's locations in-between flights. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX day comes and we arrive early at the airport to pick up the puppy at the baggage claim, but no flights were coming in at XXXX XXXX. 30 min after the promised arrival time, I get an email from the shipping service asking for {$1000.00} refundable customs fee to get past the Alabama airport. I immediately questioned this charge and after further discussions, I was blocked by XXXX on XXXX, kicked from his group, and got the shipping number erased from their website. It sucked to realize I was scammed, but I called my bank the same day and filed a scam/fraud claim about the earlier XXXX payment XXXX After 8 business days of waiting, I called and got told they found no scam or fraud and can not return the money. I am extremely frustrated this has continued to be ignored even as the facebook page continues to exist and scam more people."
440,I submitted a claim but my case closed. I sent in XXXX to a man over XXXX but the user is now listed as unregistered. The number the money was sent over to is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and this happened on XX/XX/XXXX.
441,"On XX/XX/2022 I transferred {$50.00} to XXXX XXXX through my bank Wells Fargo and the money transfer app through XXXX, called XXXX. XXXX XXXX scammed me and never mailed my order to me. I have been in contact with her and she does not intend to reimburse me as she says she already spent my money. Wells Fargo says they do not offer protection from scammers. Had I known that upfront, I wouldn't have used the app at all. I felt safe as it is available through my bank. It is the only money transfer app I used because of this reason."
442,On XX/XX/2021 I received a text message from what claimed to be Wells Fargo asking if I authorized a XXXX transfer. I replied no. Then a few minutes later I received a call from what was the exact Wells Fargo customer service number. I spoke with someone who claimed to be a banker and he stated that someone was taking XXXX in XXXX and that to stop it I needed to XXXX money to myself. I added my phone number and name as a receipient after verifying again that it was the Wells Fargo phone number on the website. I then completed the transfer after the banker told me that this was the only way to stop the theft. They hung up on me as soon as the money left my account and I realized I had been scammed. I called Wells Fargo right away to report it and since then they have claimed they have no obligation to help me regain my funds. I have escalated the case 4 times and have been denied every time because they claim even though it was coerced I authorized the transfer.
443,"On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX PM I withdrew {$1000.00} cash from a Wells Fargo ATM on XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NJ. The machine only dispensed {$560.00}, the remainder was stuck in the machine and could not be pull out. The machine erroneously printed a receipt indicating {$1000.00} was withdrawn. The {$440.00} was visibly stuck in the machine, it could not be extracted. There was no one in the branch to report this to it was closed. 

I immediately contacted customer service. They commenced an investigation and provided a temporary credit. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter advising the investigation was completed and "" determined there was no error. Your account was charged the correct amount for the transactions. '' They offer "" copies of documents used in making out decision ''. I expect that the transaction would be video recorded, this would provide ample evidence of the error. No paper evidence would show that the money was stuck in the machine."
444,My ID and debit card were stolen and my account was hacked l am trying my best to resolve the issue with my back. A cashiers check was authorized and took {$5200.00}
445,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I was a victim of fraud via Wells Fargo and XXXX. I filed a complaint with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX, claim # XXXX and XXXX. I filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission on XX/XX/XXXX, # XXXX. I filed an Executive Complaint with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX case # XXXX and with the CFPB # XXXX. Wells Fargo has taken the position they will not reimburse the funds {$1000.00} from my checking and {$2500.00} from my savings, totaling {$3500.00}. I am at a lost for words because Federal Law requires banks to reimburse consumers for this type of fraud through Regulation E. The Electronic Funds Transmission Act was implemented and amended for my exact scenario. It can also be found in the EFTA FAQ 's Errors and Resolutions item # 5. Why is it that no one is holding Wells Fargo feet to the fire and requiring them to reimburse the {$3500.00} that was stolen from me, by an imposter claiming to be a representative of the Bank. Wells Fargo relies on their loyal customers to generate billions of dollars in revenue for them but does not reciprocate the loyalty when vulnerable customers are preyed upon. I simply want to be reimbursed. I also want them to be held accountable to Federal Law the same as the consumer."
446,"On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a fraud claim through Wells Fargo Bank in person letting them know that someone used their XXXX # to contact me and trick me into believing that he was a representative from the Wells Fargo Bank. First, I was contacted via text about a fraud attempt, asking if I'd attempted a {$3500.00} XXXX transfer. After responding "" No '' I received a call from someone who spoofed the XXXX # on the back of my debit card. 

Before I knew it {$3500.00} was taken from my bank account and sent to an unknown XXXX Bank account. Wells Fargo Bank advised that the investigation could take up to XXXX business days. 

On XXXX XXXX I filed a police report ( XXXX XXXX with XXXX Police XXXX Report # XXXX ). As of XX/XX/XXXX, it had been XXXX business days and the bank informed me that their fraud investigation team came up with nothing and closed my case. They were waiting for XXXX to get back to them. {$3500.00} ( in two transactions ) was taken from my savings account on XX/XX/XXXX. I have texts confirming the transfer of the XXXX money and a case number which has been dropped by Wells Fargo Bank. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the bank informed me that they are unable to recover the money. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from Agent XXXX from Wells Fargo ( XXXX Ext XXXX, Claim # XXXX ) officially advising that Wells Fargo Bank is unable to help me recover my {$3500.00}. 
I am XXXX and having XXXX XXXX due to this horrific situation, struggling to pay my bills and have no one else to turn to. 

Your help would be greatly appreciated."
447,"On XX/XX/2021 I tried to transfer money from my XXXX account to my Wells Fargo account. For some reason the XXXX account did not link up with my bank account, Wells Fargo. So, I called the XXXX Customer Service line, which I found online. 

A man with a foreign accent, which I thought was a call center ( which made sense to me ), asked me for some information on my account. Then, he said he could help me transfer the money. I did as he asked. He said I needed to access my Wells Fargo account so that he could link up the XXXX account. He directed me to enter Server Codes into a XXXX transaction. He gave me the name and the code. At first, I was suspicious, but he said that I was not transferring money, I was merely helping him connect the two accounts, Wells Fargo with XXXX. 

The first attempt he informed me did not work. So we repeated the process several times. He spoke very fast and instructed me step by step to follow his instructions. But I suddenly became very suspicious. So, I asked him to wait a moment. 

Thats when I looked at the balance of my Wells Fargo account, just to check ( I was feeling something might be wrong ), and sure enough he had manipulated me to transfer him money NOT server codes. At that moment when I told him of my balance he hung up. I tried to call him back but the line would not pick up. I tried over and over again but nothing. I was panicking! I has just been manipulated to transfer {$2900.00} out of my account! 

I immediately called Wells Fargo to inform them what happened and they said they would look into it. They did say it did appear it was a case of fraud because I did not knowingly transfer money through XXXX but, rather, server codes. Wells Fargo assured me they would look into it and that they would very likely refund me my money. 

I also called the police department in my town. They sent an officer to my house and I filed a complaint. I have a copy of it, if you need it. 

Today I got a letter in the mail informing me that Wells Fargo will not refund me the money! 

Please, please help me. I am a XXXX and I am XXXX XXXX XXXX. This money that was stolen from me accounts for more than half my savings!!!"
449,"I contacted one ink on XX/XX/XXXX when my insurance company issued me a payment of {$3400.00} and went to a virtual card that is backed by this company. I tried to do a transfer to my checking account XXXX, XXXX XXXX doesn't do transfers to XXXX, I was only trying to get the funds into my checking account the easiest quickest way. We discussed it during the call that an acquaintance that was at my house, to have the funds transferred to his account, I was under the impression it would immediately be transferred. XXXX XXXX  took his information from me XXXX XXXX at first, but everything was very confusing and h ees took the phone gave them his information, XXXX XXXX, bank is XXXX XXXX, they knew I wasnt the account thg holder, but they put me as owner of account and made transfer without my initial approval, and they told me the time frame 1 to 4 business days after the transfer was made. Because of time frame I stated I did not want to make the transfer on the same call. I spoke to a supervisor and they said they could not stop it but there was no problems because I could get ahold of my adjuster and they can stop paymen. That was a Friday evening. I contacted American modern immediately, they sent emails to my adjuster and supervisor because my adjuster wasn't in until the following Wednesday. I contacted American modern all through that week, starting on Monday, they said they were putting a stop payment, there should be no problems. I contacted them multiple times, I could never get any phone calls or emails back from anyone. I found out they could not stop payment, and said I needed to dispute with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX had me as account holder XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX his name. My adjuster stated they where not supposed to transfer funds to a non insurer. So they initiated the transfer without my confirmation and they did not give me a time frame until after the transfer 1 to 4 business days. I told them I did not want to do the transfer. They said they couldn't back out of it. Now I don't have the funds, can't get ahold of XXXX XXXX, I've tried and tried, and I did not give it the final okay before they submitted it. I've tried to correct this, and would have never transferred, knowingly it was going to be days..."
450,"On Friday, XXXX XXXX I was searching for a dog through XXXX and after extensive research came across a post from someone who was located not that far from me. Because I found them on XXXX which is supposed to be a trusted website, I reached out to the seller. After talking all day, she made me feel like everything was fine and I would be getting a dog soon. Come time for payment she wanted to use XXXX as it is linked to her bank account. I was under the impression that because XXXX is linked to our banks, I would be protected and had nothing to worry about. I sent her half the amount for the dog of {$350.00} and would send the other half once the dog arrives. A few hours later she says she is getting him ready to be shipped to me and would need the other half of the payment. This raised a red flag and the person I was speaking to started sounding more and more suspicious. I refused to send her the other half and everything was supposed to be canceled and refunded. She showed me a screenshot of her sending my money back but it has been 2 days and nothing. I have tried messaging the seller and it has been silent. I can not get a hold of her now. I have tried contacting my bank, Wells Fargo, and so far they have not offered any solutions. If XXXX is linked to our bank accounts, I do not understand why we are not protected against fraud and scams. This makes people not trust the service."
452,I have been victim of XXXX scam ad XX/XX/XXXX all XXXX transactions are unauthorized as of XX/XX/XXXX on recorded I was told after submitting affidavits I will get my money back please help me
453,"On XX/XX/XXXX I paid cash to my Wells Fargo Bank for a cashiers check to pay my mortgage. Mailed a cashier 's check for {$1500.00} to my mortgage company the same day. By XX/XX/XXXX the cashier 's check still had not reached my mortgage company. I did talk to my mortgage company they told me to give it a couple days mail was slow because of XXXX. I then waited till XX/XX/XXXX to see if they received it they had not. That's when I went to my bank to have a stop payment put on the check. That cost me {$31.00} at my bank .The Wells Fargo representative that I placed the stop payment with told me that I would have to wait 30 days before the money would be refunded to my account, and that I would not have to come up to the bank personally. Now on XX/XX/XXXX my mortgage company sent a letter to me stating notice of return check for the sum of XXXX have been returned to us by your bank for the following reason stop payment. XX/XX/XXXX would have been the date for the {$1500.00} to be put back into my account which do not happen. I keep getting the runaround from the bank and my mortgage company. My bank keeps telling me I need the original check so they could refund my money and a mortgage company keeps telling me they sent my bank a photocopy because mortgage company destroyed the original check. Bank says pretty much photocopy won't work and it may take three years to get my money back do I have any recourse? thank you."
455,"I was using XXXX money transfer on XX/XX/XXXX and mistakenly used the wrong phone with the write name. Typed XXXX instead of XXXX. 
Wells Fargo said they can't help because the transaction went through. I tried telling them there was an error in the number and the money went to a person I don't know but they said they couldn't reverse the transaction. They expect me to call the person myself."
456,"I submitted a claim with CFPB ( case # XXXX ) a few weeks back. 
Wells Fargo has attempted to close out this claim and I am not satisfied with their response. 
I officially retired on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
WF indicates the XXXX XXXX XXXX took over XX/XX/XXXX which was almost a year after my retirement date! 
WF closed out my 401 k and transferred my monies to XXXX. Not XXXX XXXX. 
WF deducted over XXXX from my funds for transfer. 

I do not think their response for me to reach out to XXXX XXXX is appropriate. 

Thank you"
457,"This is the classic XXXX fraud that is happening everywhere. 
On Sunday afternoon, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a text using the Wells Fargo logo, stating that {$3500.00} dollars was authorized to be sent and asked if I recognized it. I texted no. After a few minutes, I received a phone call from the exact Wells Fargo number that is on the back of my Wells Fargo debit card. The person stated that my XXXX had been hacked and that I needed to send money to myself to stop the process. I followed his instructions and sent XXXX dollars to my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX email address ( XXXX ). I received notice in my XXXX email that I had received money. Then the person asked for other info, and I suspected fraud, so I hung up. I immediately called Wells Fargo and detailed the problem. They said they would investigate and that someone would call me on Monday. Nobody called ; after XXXX weeks, I called Wells Fargo and complained, and again, they promised me somebody would call ; nobody called. But I received an email, so I sent an email to the customer service rep, but no response. A few days later, I received notice that the case was close, for I had authorized the payment, so Wells Fargo could do nothing. 

I then notified Wells Fargo by telephone that they were violating a Federal Order, listed at https : //www.consumerfinance.gov/compliance/compliance-resources/deposit-accounts-resources/electronic-fund-transfers/electronic-fund-transfers-faqs/ I have still heard nothing. I lost XXXX dollars using the XXXX app that is part of the Wells Fargo phone app. I did not authorize these funds, and Wells Fargo is violating the Federal orders by not responding and not reimbursing me the money."
459,"On XX/XX/2021 I sent a wire to my attorney 's office XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I did not know that someone had hacked their email address and altered the wiring instructions. on XX/XX/2021 the attorney reaches out to me to tell me they did not receive the wire. It was at the moment we realized the wire instructions were fraudulent. The money had gone to Wells Fargo from XXXX XXXX. I immediately reached out to both XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo. XXXX XXXX was extremely helpful and began contacting Wells Fargo as well. 
Wells Fargo was NOT HELPFUL AT ALL and still is not being helpful. They will not even return my calls anymore, and the issue is not resolved. 
Myself and the Bank contacted Wells Fargo on XXXX through multiple channels... the wire department, the fraud department, a local branch, voice messages, emails, etc. When I finally was able to speak to someone they gave me a "" timeline '' of events and told me that we notified them on XXXX but that they did not start working on it until XXXX. Why would they wait that long? 
A friend in the banking industry had a contact at Wells Fargo who told me that because the name on the account was an individual 's account and the beneficiary of the wire was a business, this threw up a red flag. That admittance had me HOPEFUL. 
XXXX in the Fraud Department finally tells me "" on a recorded line '' that they are REQUIRED by Regulation J to accept a wire even if the beneficiary does not match. I have since found out that is completely false. They CAN accept the wire, but they do not have to as she stated. 
XXXX XXXX recalled the wire and Wells Fargo only returned {$200000.00} of the {$350000.00} that was sent to them. They said the other funds had already gone out including two large checks that were cashed, one to the account holder himself. They took absolutely no action to try to stop or get that money back even though they knew it was fraudulent. 
We are working with our local police department, and they have even told us how unhelpful Wells Fargo is being in helping solve the case and recover our funds. They have a search warrant that was provided to WF, yet still they are not helpful. 
I would like someone to CALL ME. Once XXXX told me the {$200000.00} was coming back, she was done with me. She will not return my calls or answer my messages and my questions about the remaining. 
I have never felt so poorly treated or dismissed by a financial institution. I feel like I am being discriminated against because I do not have a lot of money and am not a rich person who can make them a lot of income. Because they know {$350000.00} is my entire life savings, they could care less about me and my problem. If I had millions of dollars in their bank, I am sure I would not be treated like this."
460,"XX/XX/21 I initiated A transfer from my Wells Fargo account to my XXXX account for the amount of {$900.00}. The money was withdrawn from my Wells Fargo account but never appeared in my XXXX account and still hasnt as of today ( XX/XX/21 ). On XX/XX/21 I filed a claim with Wells Fargo and was told that I would be receiving a credit for the amount of money I was missing if nothing was resolved within 10 business days. I called again within the 10 business days to see if any information had been found and was told that nothing had been resolved, but again I would receive a credit for the amount of money I was missing if nothing was resolved within 10 business days. On the 10th business day, upon not receiving the credit for {$900.00} that I was missing, I called Wells Fargo and was told that I had been misinformed by both representatives I spoke to earlier and that I would not be receiving a credit. I was also told that the only inquiries done by Wells Fargo was an attempted phone call to XXXX on the ninth business day. I received a letter in the mail from Wells Fargo stating that my claim has been closed and I am still out of my {$900.00}, over a month later. Today ( XX/XX/21 ) I called Wells Fargo asking for clarification about the closing of my claim and asked if I was just out of the {$900.00} I attempted to transfer and they instructed me to call XXXX and give them a trace Number. When I called XXXX and explain the situation to them and told them that I had a trace number to give them, the lady was confused and said that its some thing that Wells Fargo should be dealing with since it is essentially a missing payment. Nobody can tell me anything about where my money is and I am still out of {$900.00} over a month later. I have had to take out a loan to be able to afford my rent, bills, and everyday necessities due to not having this money. After this is resolved I would like to close my account with dwells Fargo because this is ridiculous and I am never dealing with something like this again. I have been robbed."
468,I have been in touch with more than 1 month finally their executive assured me after submitting affidavits I will get my funds back it was on recorded line as of XX/XX/2022 but yesterday again they humiliated and refused to honor their on words Im feeling helpless
470,I have an account with Wells Fargo and I havent received any info regarding the law suit. I need to know if Im entitled to any money
471,"On XX/XX/2021 I wired transferred {$20000.00} to a Wells Fargo Account for XXXX XXXX with account # XXXX Direct deposit/Electronic payment # XXXX, this person XXXX XXXX was an associate of XXXX XXXX XXXX which I thought was helping me do my investments but it was all a scam. One thing is for sure this person XXXX XXXX in fact did receive the {$20000.00} I wired transferred from my bank XXXX XXXX XXXX  out of XXXX Texas with phone number XXXX XXXX XXXX. I tried contacting Wells Fargo to stop this transaction, I was on the phone for over 4 hours trying to speak to someone every time they answered they sent me to another person and so forth, they took over 2 weeks to respond to XXXX XXXX XXXX  over an email that they couldnt do anything about it because I was not on XXXX XXXX account."
472,"I received a call from a Wells Fargo phone number on XX/XX/2021 with someone who claimed to be a representative from Wells Fargo. He asked if I, or someone, had charged {$3000.00} in Minnesota from my account because there was a charge, even though I could not see it from my WF app. I told him that was not me and he sent me a confirmation text with a code to read back to him just like Wells Fargo does, making this fraudster more believable. He then walked me through the steps to XXXX myself the {$3000.00} saying that it would reverse the payment so the money was not removed. The money disappeared from my account and then he assured me that it would be back in my account within 24 hours. When it was not, I called Wells Fargo and they informed me that nobody from there had called me and it was fraud. I called the fraud phone number of Wells Fargo and each time they opened a claim it was closed for unknown reasons- nobody even notifying me that it was closed or that I wasn't getting my money back. I talked to someone in person at Wells Fargo who also was of no help because everyone was telling me this situation is not considered fraud. I received an email recently explaining this exact situation and to beware of fraudsters that will take money by XXXX and to call the Wells Fargo Scam & Fraud line ASAP. I did that many times and nobody is helping me! I can not lose this money and it is not my fault that someone was able to access my information and manipulate a Wells Fargo phone number to steal money."
476,As of XX/XX/2022 on recorded line customer service representative told me after submitting Affidavits I will get back all my unauthorized XXXX transactions but then they refused it I just want my hard earned money back
477,"On XXXX XXXX, 2019, I got scammed from a person named XXXX XXXX in XXXX asking me my account information to transfer {$490.00} through my WellsFaro banking account. 

After I realize its a scam, I contact Wells Fargo, however, they were unwilling to help and reverse the transaction of {$490.00} for me."

I took me a long time to delete this app. At XXXX I reported this to Wells Fargo XXXX they closed my account, and opened new one. They saw the wire transfer had gone to XXXX, and said they put in a request to rescind this transfer but said they are not hopeful.I was able to then check my emails and texts, all from Wells Fargo, asking me to sign on to my account and verify my mobile number.They then provided an Advanced Access Code to hacker and allowed him to add his name, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as an online wire transfer recipient.Other notifications were sent confirming that a wire transfer was made from my checking account. Wells Fargo apparently using XXXX to make wire transfers using mobile phone number.I am somewhat elderly, and this has rattled me very much!!!!

I have banked with WF for many years... I did not know they use XXXX automatically as I never would have agreed to this.

However, my father and sister had broken into his home in 2018 when he passed and had stolen all his finiancial records.

482,"I work internationally as a XXXX in XXXX. My school provides us with a large bonus of {$7100.00} XXXX or {>= $1,000,000} XXXX, which is a significant amount of my salary in XXXX. The money was deposited into my XXXX bank account on XXXX, XXXX. I went to the bank with a representative of my school and a few other teachers to wire transfer the money to our USA bank accounts so we can use our money while home for the holidays. I performed the transfer at my bank in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ). I was informed during this time that my bank.

I was ordered by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to stop communicating with the bank and a supporting letter was sent from the XXXX Department who previously refused to fully examine my concerns about switching my savings account with a withdrawal regulation to a checking account with unlimited withdrawals. The change ultimately resulting more than {$14000.00} drawn from the XXXX XXXX Account set up with Wells Fargo to temporarily pay some medical expenses. 

Since I was ordered to cease communication with the bank I am requesting our state become involved in the mediation process. I would like to go on record and state I have not accepted the check as any form of settlement in the unauthorized account change and want this complaint to clearly state the efforts made to honor the cashier 's check were fruitless and still have not cleared the Wells Fargo account.

I went into the branch made a claim after a couple days I called the banker that I made the claim with and she was able to give me a temporary credit until they could locate the checks and sort out the confusion. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX and they took the {$600.00} back and said that the claim specialist rejected the claim after two months!!!!! Two months?!?! During an epidemic where people cant work and are struggling to pay bills they decide to reject my claim?!?! They can offer me no information over the phone they can provide me with nobody that knows anything about whats going on and they cant return the checks.
493,"XX/XX/XXXX - I initiated payment using Wells Fargo 's bill pay system for property taxes to the XXXX XXXX ( FL ) tax collector in the amount of {$6200.00}. 
This payment was due by XX/XX/XXXX to qualify for a 4 % discount. My record from the bank shows it was sent on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - I checked with the tax collector to see if the payment had been received as it had not cleared. 
They had not received payment as of that date. I showed them a proof of payment indicating when the payment was initiated. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I again checked in with the tax collector. I spoke to XXXX XXXX? ) who said she would check with the person who was actually processing the payments to see if it had arrived. It had not posted yet. The person processing the payments is onsite. I was present during this phone call. The person processing the payments said my payment had just arrived. It was in an envelope with a number of other checks, the latest of which showed a date of XX/XX/XXXX. There was no postmark on the envelope as it was a commercial XXXX. 
My complaint is the bank debits the funds immediately from my account but does not send them when they say they do. Assuming my check, mailed with a number of others, was mailed on XX/XX/XXXX ( the date of the most recent check in the envelope ), that is two weeks later than they indicate on the proof of payment. When I call the bank, they just regurgitate the date that is on the check. I did file a complaint in writing and their response is they batch payments going to the same address and that's OK. Obviously, tax payments are time-sensitive and that makes this deception that much more egregious. I believe that their bill pay practices are deceptive as the implication with the proof of payment is that it is sent when the payer initiated the payment. It is not. Additionally, what are they doing with my money in the two weeks from when they debit my account to when the payee actually gets it? In my book, this is fraud. I don't have a problem with batching payments AS LONG AS THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME DATE AND ARE MAILED WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE MAILING THEM."

495,"On XX/XX/22 I was scammed online by individuals who led me to believe my online banking was hacked and that someone was trying to withdraw {$15000.00} out of my savings account. In order to save my funds I was instructed to go to my bank and withdraw my savings account and wire the funds to a security account that was opened at another banking institution to protect me. I went to my bank and wired those funds to the account information they provided to me which my bank did question me about this transaction. I had to pretend that I knew the person I wired the money to. The scammer made me believe they were from my security department because I gave them the phone number on the back of my card. They stayed in touch with me the whole weekend because the banks were closed for the holiday, When the bank opened on XXXX  they instructed me to go to the bank so they could tell me how to get the money back into an account for me. They were really sending me there to drain my checking account ( which I almost did ), but my brain finally clicked in and I realized I was scammed. I talked to my branch manager about this and I went to my local police and filed a report with them. I do not hold my bank accountable, however, I do question the other bank involved. I feel something was not legitimate in the way the account was opened or how the withdrawal was made."
496,WELLS FARGO BANK now you have the information to make this right. I know this is money laundering and if not corrected you are put of it.
498,On XX/XX/XXXX I was conversing with someone from XXXX on 3 tickets to the XXXX XXXX game on XX/XX/XXXX. We emailed back and forth regarding procing. I got a request via Wells Fargo from his account ( name and number of requested included in this request ). I sent the money and tickets never came. Then email responses stopped. I called the number that I got via XXXX and the person who picked up said they never posted an ad about tickets. He claims identity theft. I called my bank and told them that he money was transferred to an account via there app. They refused to help.
499,"On XX/XX/17 i Transfer {$1800.00} from my wells fargo checking account using XXXX. 
I add the recepient email address to send him the funds. 
The recepient receive the email confirmation that the funds where on its way but they never arrived and the curios things is that the email he received say that the funds where going to a different bank and to a different name. 
As soon as this happened that same day we contact wells fargo over the phone and also in person, they open a claim at the branch and one claim over the phone. 
After a couple of weeks i got a letter that there is nothing they can do because the funds went into someones account and the bank that receive it ( XXXX ) cant cooperate on providing information on the person who receive the funds. 
After this first claim i tried 3 more times opening new claims, and the answer was always the same."

XX/XX/XXXX. and then the XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX this will conclude my statement
503,I bank with wellsfargo and been with thIs bank for many years. I signed up with XXXX through my bank thinking I was protected if any fraud or scams were to occur. I made a payment in the amount of {$450.00} for a XXXX XXXX gift for my mom. I scammer never sent the merchandise and I am unable to get back in contact with them. I contacted XXXX XXXX   no help. Contacted my bank they told me there is nothing they can do. How could this be happening I asked? I used my bank account to access XXXX like I always do thinking Im protected when sending money. Unfortunately WellsFargo did nothing to help and the Representative saw the transaction and told me the payment was sent to a XXXX account.
504,"Back in late XXXX early XXXX I was moving apartments and selling some of my stuff on XXXX XXXX I had received some offers about purchasing some rugs of mine. The way the transaction was supposed to go down was through XXXX. I have used XXXX before though my Wells Fargo account and never had an issue. Was told that because this person had a "" Business Account '' they would have to wire me money first and then I would send back to them. Sounded fishy so I XXXX "" XXXX contact numbers '' and was given a number that looked official from a website which I now know was a fake XXXX website. 

When I called the number they told me I would have to make a couple of transfers to them which were 2 XXXX  transfers in order to make sure the transactions were valid. I noticed the money went out of my account but I didn't see it come back to my account. This happened within minutes and the date was XX/XX/22. I called WF within 10 minutes of the transaction and told them about it and was initially told they would probably cover it but received a few notices within 2 weeks that they would not refund my money. 

Had no idea that XXXX was a joint venture of some of the world 's largest banks and that they literally have no safeguards in place to rake care of their consumers with fraud like this. There is no recourse and it appears that anyone can open an account for fraudulent purposes."
510,"On XX/XX/2022, I was contacted by XXXX XXXX ; phone number ; ( XXXX ) XXXX through messenger. He pretended that he was a high classmate and from there, he mentioned about XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX run by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) XXXX.

At around, XXXX XXXX I went to my bank ; Wells Fargo Branch at XXXX and spoke to XXXX XXXX and I told him that I want a wire transfer of {$30000.00}. He wire transfer the money to XXXX XXXX XXXX and routing number of XXXX. At XXXX XXXX, I call the Wells Fargo customer services and I told them that I was scammed by XXXX XXXX. The banker representative told me that they could not stop the wire transfer because it happened at XXXX XXXX. They gave a case number of XXXX. Today, XX/XX/2022, they told me that the case was close due to not enough evidence."
512,On XX/XX/22 I was a victim of fraud to a impersonator of Wells Fargo. The person acted as an employee and called me with all of my information complaining they were from the fraud department. The phone numbers and all of the questions matched up and the impersonator got into my account and wired money to theirselves. My bank Wells Fargo refused to refund my money and said they were not liable for any wire fraud what so ever.
515,"I set up an online money transfer to my friend from  my Wellsfargo checking  account by using its  XXXX  function. On  XXXX  I got a letter from the bank informing me that "" You have canceled a payment to ( my friend name ) ... '' which I never did. I am currently out of the country for business trip until  XXXX , so I had to make  three  international calls today (  XXXX  -  XXXX ,  XXXX ,   XXXX   XXXX   ) talking to  Wellsfargo  customer service and online fraud dept trying to find out what was going on.     I gave them my bank account, SSN, online banking user name and answered couple questions they asked, then I was told based on the information I provided the only way I can do is to go to  a Wellsfargo branch with my picture ID and then call them again. I informed them my situation ( out of the country until   XXXX   ) and ask if any other info such as passport/driver License etc. I can provid e to prove my identity or I can even go to the nearby  US Embassy if needed, however they insisted that the only way they can help me is that I go to a Wellsfargo branc h. I feel frustrated and asked for the info of whoever in charge of the online fraud dept or talk to different dept to solve the problem, however the supervisor (  XXXX ,  XXXX   )  told me their dept is the only one and they already put a notice on my account so even if I talk to any other depts they will transfer me back to online fraud dept, so the only way they can help is, again, go back to  US, find a Wellsfargo branch, show a personal banker my picture ID, and ask that  person to call online fraud dept.     Something wrong here. Understand that   Wellsfargo try to protect customers ' interest, but not no flexibility with rude attitude. If this is Wellsfargo policy, a wrong policy.
I will not stop my critical business trip to go back to US now just f  or a {$1500.00} online transfer. I will just use my account from another bank to do it. Yes, I will still go to a local  Wellsfargo branch after I go back to the States, but what I will do is just cancel all my 4 accounts with Wellsfargo."
518,"I have been trying to fix a mistaken transfer with Wells Fargo for a year and a half. 
The wire transfer of XXXX  was deposited into the wrong account, as the sender ( XXXX XXXX which is my brother, and lives in XXXX ) committed a mistake in the account number of the recipient, nevertheless the name and address of the recipient were correct. 

Every time I talk to Wells Fargo ( at least 30 or more times ), they say that the originating bank in XXXX is responsible. 

The originating Bank in XXXX made a thorough investigation, and Wells Fargo Bank responded that the wire was deposited into another account holder of Wells Fargo Bank, and they couldn't retrieve it. ( Letter attached from Wells Fargo ) and attached wire transfer too. 
Wells Fargo keeps on saying they are escalating and escalating this complaint which has more than XXXX years and nothing gets resolved. 
I copy the letter sent by my brother to Wells Fargo which has all the corresponding dates : Dear Sirs : On XX/XX/2021, I instructed an electronic transfer ( wire transfer ) of US XXXX from my company account XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX to my sisters Wells Fargo Account. Attached a copy of the wire transfer instructions. 
Unfortunately, I incorrectly indicated as account the number XXXX, being the correct as indicated above, without prejudice to the fact that the name and address of the beneficiary were correct, this is XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Alaska. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, when I noticed that the funds had not been credited to my sister 's account, checking the wire transfer instruction I noticed the mistake, immediately informing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX so that they could initiate the pertinent steps to recover the funds. From then on, the executive of my local bank informed that they were going to make the necessary arrangements with Wells Fargo Bank to recover the funds. 
After 3 months, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, signed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX, attached, excusing themselves from all responsibility, since they had executed the order as indicated in the wire transfer instructions, with the wrong account number. In addition to this letter, my executive at XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX informed me that Wells Fargo Bank had executed the instructed order only taking as a reference the wrongly indicated account number and not the name of the true beneficiary receiving the funds a thir-party, owner of the account wrongly indicated. Also, they told me that Wells Fargo has requested to such third-party the return of the funds and that such request was denied. 
What seems strange and the reason to contact Wells Fargo Bank, is the fact that after the request of Wells Fargo Bank to the third party that received the funds incorrectly, XXXX denied its return, considering that those funds does not belong to such third party and therefore has no legal cause to receive and withhold them. In our banking legislation in XXXX, that third party is considered an illegal recipient of funds as there is no legal cause, not allowing to take advantage and appropriate such funds being returned in almost all cases. 
I would be very grateful if you could review this case again and analyze possible solutions, those funds are relevant to my sister, and we feel uncomfortable to accept that they have been illegally appropriated by a third party based only on a numerical account number error that may occur and not having a possibility of recovery. 
We also have in Wells Fargo joint owned account number XXXX, therefore I am also a client of Wells Fargo Bank. 
Your help and assistance is highly appreciated. 
Best regards,"
519,Wells Fargo wouldn't cash my first stimulus check. I mailed it back and still didn't get the money. {$1200.00}.
520,"On XX/XX/2021, I went to Wells Fargo branch in XXXX XXXX Texas with my young daughter. I was in Texas due to my mothers ' passing away. I went into the branch to do a cash advance from my unemployment card of {$480.00}. The individual was a female and a service manager. She asked if I was a member with a checking or savings account and I replied no. She asked, how can I help you? I said, cash advance off my card. She asked the amount and I said {$480.00}. I noticed that she had trouble with the computer as she was keyed in my drivers ' license. She asked why was I in Texas and I said my mother died. She then went into her draw to grab the cash and I turned around to look at my young daughter who was seated in the lobby to check on her. As I turned back, I saw only {$400.00} and couldn't see the rest and I asked that the money be out of the envelope. She placed it in the envelope and sealed it. I left the branch with my receipt and the envelope. It was late around XXXX XXXX  that I was at a drive through to buy dinner for my family and opened the envelope. I saw that it had only {$420.00}. I was so upset and wished that I could go back to the bank but it was after hours. Therefore, I tried going in the next morning when they opened. I approached a teller and told her what happen. I saw the same individual and she began to say I gave you the money yesterday. I told her that it was short by {$60.00} and that to pull the tapes. It became a he say she say because she started to count her draw as if the money would have showed up that morning when it would had been last night. I was so incensed at her unprofessionalism and her alledging that I lied to make more money. When she called the escalation team that is what she told them and it upsetted me. I want Wells Fargo to rectify this problem asap."
522,"I used XXXX to pay for an online service. Unbeknownst to me, there is no buyer protection, although its backed by my bank. The vendor turned out to be a scam. I called my bank and was told there was nothing they could do because I authorized the payment. This was the first time I ever used XXXX for an online purchase. Later, I found multiple complaints on XXXX  with similar experiences to mine. Wells Fargo should be more upfront about the risks of XXXX and make their customers aware. I lost {$500.00} and was left heartbroken."
523,"I had lined up a purchase through XXXX to purchase concert tickets. The individual wanted me to send money through XXXX, which I did through my Wells Fargo app. Upon completion of transferring the {$250.00} for the tickets, the individual stopped answering my texts. I called XXXX and spoke to them about my situation. They were not helpful and seemed to not be willing to help me since I went through XXXX."
524,"This complaint is based on a wire transfer from an international origination to Wells Fargo Bank here in the US. The originating country was XXXX and the funds relating to a real estate transaction dated XX/XX/20. 
On the day of this wire transfer I had checked on XXXX the current day exchange rate from Danish crowns to US dollars. I wanted to see what the amount was and to double check once the funds was transferred and posted to my account that the amount was correct. 
The property that was being sold was owned by myself, my Mother and my Sister, 1/3 equal share. The day funds was to be transferred it was going to 3 different banks, two in XXXX where my Mom and Sister lives and then to me here in the US. 
Once the funds was posted to my account it was significantly short of the expected amount, to the order of almost XXXX dollars. 
I called my Sister to see if she was facing the same dilemma, as it turned out her amount corresponded very closely to the actual exchange rate for that day. 
I proceeded to contact my bank and subsequently had a meeting with the branch manager XXXX XXXX in my home town, XXXX XXXX, XXXX We met on XX/XX/20 at the branch office. I explained the situation and told her I was obviously not pleased with this outcome and felt the Bank had basically stolen funds behind my back since no disclosure for this type of business practice was made prior to the transfer. I have been a customer of excellent standing with this bank for over 30 years and felt betrayed from this action. She was very understanding and literally was not aware of this type of practice with wire transfers. She told me she would look into this and get back to me. She phoned after a week and told me she had had several conversations with different people but said no one could commit and explain why I was given such a poor exchange rate internal to Wells Fargo. I was then directed to a different person that would help further and XXXX said she had done what she can from her end. I was then contacted by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/20 and was given an official case number XXXX, this was left on voice message. I called him on XX/XX/20 and was told this case had been elevated to the Executive Office and the person handling this was XXXX XXXX, phone XXXX. I called and briefly spoke to her, she was not at her desk and said she would get back to me. We connected on XX/XX/20 and had a fairly long conversation where she could not provide the answers I was looking for and I asked for her to please identify her superior and someone that had some sort of decision making ability, I was referred to XXXX XXXX, her direct report. 
I spoke with XXXX on XX/XX/20 and yet again faced with their attitude in no wrong doing and not willing to help and set things right. This was a long conversation and with me asking how this type of business practices can actually be legal. They basically say we will do a wire transfer for XXXX dollars and then they knowingly and covertly and on purpose do not tell you that on top of that they will skim the funds to the order of, in my case 3.3 %! After this type of verbal exchange she eventually offered me XXXX dollars as a onetime restitution that would not be offered again, I respectfully declined and told her she needed to do better. I informed her of some quick research I had done once I realized this is apparently a common normal practice with the banks here in the US. There are other options and avenues you can explore when it comes to International money transfers, several companies and organizations depending what your needs are, and with much more competitive exchange rates. I mentioned one of them, XXXX and said Wells Fargo needed to at least match their rates for me to be satisfied. XXXX basically told me that will never happen. I again asked for her superior to discuss this further since she could not make a decision on her own to solve this issue and retain me as a customer. She said she would elevate it further and have an upper management discussion. She got back to me a few days later and said their final offer of resolution was to meet me half way between the exchange rate that was going on the day of the wire and the amount they gave me, this amount rounded to XXXX dollars. I accepted this but said this is still not a resolution and I would explore this further and decide what direction to go especially weather Wells Fargo will represent me in the future. Everyone I have spoken to and given a quick synopsis has been completely unaware this goes on behind the scenes and literally shocked to realize this. Even talking to the different bank officials they have also indicated this practice should be modified and made more clear."
526,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was solicited online for an investment training program for building wealth. I learned about the program previously through social media outlets through which I was familiar. I was directed to establish an account via XXXX to submit bi-weekly payments and to have a portion of the payments invested. I established an account with XXXX  and submitted payments via this channel using XXXX from my XXXX account. I began making payments to XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX and continued through XX/XX/XXXX using my personal Wells Fargo Checking Account to transfer funds to XXXX  and then to the XXXX XXXX  address provided to me by XXXX. The XXXX  platform reflected my payments and showed a portion of the payments that were being invested and their current earnings. My XXXX  account balance as of XX/XX/XXXX was {$170000.00} when I requested to proceed with a withdrawal from the investment account. I never received any prompts or security concerns from XXXX despite the financial value of the transactions. I was instructed in order to receive my investment funds I had to pay additional fees on top of the bi-weekly payments I was already making. There were two wire transfers completed from Wells Fargo bank in the amount of {$25000.00} dollars sent to XXXX  between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I was told that there were multiple errors and upgrades that my account needed in order to proceed with the withdrawals and overcome the errors which were due to such a large dollar amount being transferred. These communications came from the XXXXXXXX  via email. I paid the additional fees to upgrade my account and still the withdrawal transactions failed to both my XXXX  and XXXX  accounts. After multiple exchanges via email, I was instructed to pursue a bank wire transfer to receive my funds. At this time an additional {$2500.00} was requested by the XXXX platform to carry out this transaction. Personally, I invested more than {$78000.00} from XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX. After not receiving the funds I tried to contact a representative via phone and I could not contact anyone. It was at this time I realized I had been scammed. Currently, my XXXX account still shows a balance which reflects the additional fees submitted above with balance XXXX. There was one attempt by XXXX to submit a deposit into my XXXX account, however the amount was negligible. This transaction occurred between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 
I made efforts to file complaints and claims with Wells Fargo and XXXX to recuperate the funds I had lost. Several high ranking employees of Wells Fargo Claims and Customer Service Department stated that since XXXX was the merchant of the XXXX transactions, that they hold the authority to settle this dispute and have nothing else they can do in this case. In terms of XXXX, I have received no investigation or formal response into the matter. I have filed complaints with the XXXX Police Department, FBI XXXX XXXX, SEC, XXXX, Wells Fargo, XXXX and several other regulatory bodies. Of note, XXXX has also inactivated my account online so I have not been able to communicate or conduct any transactions with their platform since the incident."
527,I purchased two XXXX. Cashiers checks XX/XX/2017 from Wells Fargo Bank. I was told that the checks didnt not expire nor is there an expiration date written on the checks. Approximately one month ago I tried to cash the checks and was told that Wells Fargo no longer had the funds and that the money was sent to a lost funds account. I have spoken to several bankers and was directed to different websites with no such luck of locating the money. The final straw was today when I was ask what do you want us to do? in a very disrespectful tone by XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX.
528,"I used the XXXX Transfer service provided by Wells Fargo when I log into my account to pay for a product. I purchased tickets XXXX. XXXX 2021 to a XXXX  game from this posting, https : XXXX on XXXX. It was fraudulent and the tickets were not delivered. I filed a claim with Wells Fargo within an hour and was given the following case number. XXXX. I followed up at the phone number they provided, XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and discovered the claim was closed. Wells Fargo files a claim with XXXX and then closes it. They only act as a messenger service for XXXX after that and they leave it their responsibility to investigate. XXXX has no motivation for pursuing a claim and Wells Fargo has no process to follow up or compel them to. I asked Wells Fargo customer service for a number to contact XXXX and pursue it myself and they wouldn't provide me with one. I contacted XXXX and they said I needed to pursue it through Wells Fargo. The Wells Fargo provided XXXX service is the exact same as sending cash through the mail. On the Wells Fargo site they compare it to using a check, but it has less protection than that. The customer is able to stop payment on a check or pursue legal action against the individual cashing the check. If Wells Fargo is not providing or supporting the XXXX service they need to transfer you out of a Wells Fargo site to prevent the misleading appearance that they do. It is totally unacceptable that a banking institution provides a service from the customers personal online account but not accept any responsibility for transactions that take place within it."
530,"Commencing on XX/XX/2022, I fell victim to a multi-layered scam operation run by XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX which involved me making deposits for a total amount of XXXX USD from my Wells Fargo account to the fraudsters."
532,I filed a dispute for a wire transfer for the amount of {$23000.00} dollars that I found out was a scam 2 days after I completed the transfer. I call my financial institution ( Wells Fargo ) and requested a swift recall with all the beneficiaries acct info and bank name ( XXXX XXXX  ). I notified them that this was a scam and I have all the supporting documentation for the transaction. The wire transfer was sent on the XXXX of XX/XX/2021 and I requested the recall on the XXXX of XXXX however my financial institution did not contact the beneficiarys financial institution until XX/XX/XXXX to request a recall on the funds.This was a total of 27 days and or 20 business days after I notified the bank that this was a scam and my money was being stolen. The bank dispute page shows all disputed transactions will have a resolution within 10 days and temporary credit to my account if the investigation would take longer. Wells Fargo did not fulfill its fiduciary dutys to me as a customer in a reasonable time frame in a attempt to recall my money. I supplied wells Fargo with the police report number and supplied my local branch with all the supporting documentation. I feel as if Wells Fargo would have acted in a timely manor then the chances of me receiving some or all of my money back would have been greatly increased.
533,"On XXXX XX/XX/2021, I submitted a wire transfer from my Wells Fargo savings account to XXXX XXXX for the amount of {$17000.00}. On XXXX XX/XX/2021 I contacted Wells Fargo and spoke to XXXX who filed a dispute/claim after I told him I needed to stop the wire because the item I was purchasing was no longer available. Today XXXX XX/XX/2021 I spoke to XXXX in escalation and she said there were no notes attached to my claim stating that anything has been done with the claim yet. I asked to file a formal complaint and speak with an executive with the organization. Ive yet to receive a call to discuss my issue with Wells Fargo. Im asking the Federal Reserve to please step in and hold this bank accountable to perform its duties and track the wire transfer down. Ive provided all the information they needed to include the account/routing number to the account it was sent to. I also provided the name and phone number to that account holder who is more than willing to assist in making this right. Ive spoken to that individual and nobody has made contact with him from Wells Fargo. XXXX XXXX  where the wire was sent has also stated Wells Fargo has not contacted them. Thank you in advance for your assistance in this matter."
537,"XX/XX/2020 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Dear Sir/Madam : The purpose of this letter is to seek your help in obtaining return of {$6200.00} that I had my wife to send by international wire transfer via Wells Fargo Bank on XX/XX/2020. Wells Fargo did not send the money yet refused to return the funds on the fallacious pretext that the transaction was not cancelled within 24 hours of placing the order. 

Indeed, in XX/XX/2020, I asked my wife who has an account at Wells Fargo Bank, XXXX, VA to send a wire transfer of {$6200.00} to XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX ( Attachment 1 ). Mr. XXXX XXXX, the Wells Fargo employee, who did the transaction told my wife that the money would arrive in 10 ( presumably ) working days, that is by XX/XX/2020. This ten-day delay came and went by. 

My wife sent a copy of the transaction paper ( Wire Transfer Services Outgoing Wire Transfer Request of Wells Fargo ) provided by Mr. XXXX XXXX to Mr. XXXX for follow-up with his bank, XXXX XXXX in XXXX. Mr. XXXX bank said that the information contained in this Wells Fargo paper was not enough to track the transfer. In particular, it did not show the international swift code. That code was essential for tracking the transaction. When my wife reported to Wells Fargo International Wire Transfer Department ( WFIWTD ) that an international swift code was needed, the staff Ms. XXXX, first said that there was no other number than the one shown on the transfer paper. Then, she said that Mr. XXXX who is in XXXX must ask his bank to contact the correspondent of Wells Fargo in the US without giving to my wife the name of the said correspondent, let alone the swift code. My wife reported to Mr. XXXX who, in turn, returned to XXXX XXXX XXXX to say that Wells Fargo asked that it ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) contact its correspondent in the US. XXXX XXXX XXXX responded that it has many correspondents in the US and could not contact any of them without any specific information about the transaction. My wife reported to the WFIWTD and it was only upon her insistence that finally the staff said that the correspondent of Wells Fargo for XXXX was the XXXX XXXX in New York. To facilitate the investigation and follow-up by the XXXX XXXX XXXX, my wife requested that Wells Fargo give her a paper showing that it sent the money to XXXX XXXX New York and that the latter acknowledged receipt, and that Wells Fargo provides the international swift code. The staff of the WFIWTD said without any explanation whatsoever that the bank could not release that paper to her, let alone the international swift code. 

Faced with this lack of cooperation from the WFIWTD, my wife returned to Wells Fargo XXXX and insisted on talking to the Manager. At that meeting which took place on XX/XX/2020, my wife requested a cancellation of the transfer and full reimbursement of the money. The Manager, Ms. XXXX XXXX responded that she would recall the funds and refund the {$45.00} wire transfer fee charged by Wells Fargo. 

On XX/XX/2020, Wells Fargo XXXX called my wife to say that the investigation was still in progress and that the funds would be returned to her. Since then, all efforts to collect the money turned fruitless. 

Under these circumstances, I sent the letter dated XX/XX/2020 to Mr. XXXX XXXX, CEO of Wells Fargo Bank to request reimbursement. 

On Friday, XX/XX/2020, a female staff of the Executive Office of Wells Fargo called my house at XXXX XXXX Eastern Time to speak to my wife. The summary of their exchange was that Wells Fargo would not return the money ( i.e. XXXX XXXX dollars ) because my wife signed a small-print form that precludes return of wire transfer funds unless the transaction is cancelled within 24 hours of initiation. That is a transfer made on XX/XX/2020, must be cancelled by XX/XX/2020 otherwise it will be forfeited even though the transacting company said that 10 days must be allowed for the money to arrive at destination. Mr. XXXX XXXX did not inform my wife of a 24-hour cancellation clause for refund. Assuming that such a clause exists, the Wells Fargo Executive Office caller provided no response to my wifes question as to how was  she expected to know that a transaction that she initiated on Wednesday, XX/XX/2020 and scheduled to settle by XX/XX/2020, would not settle so as to cancel it on Thursday, XX/XX/2020? 

The claim, after the fact, that the service must be called off before the deadline given by the contractor ( Wells Fargo ) makes no sense. Refusal to return the {$6200.00} in full is tantamount to robbery. I would most appreciate your help in assisting me to recover my money in full. The Power of Attorney of my wife authorizing me to act on her behalf is available for your information. 

I thank you in advance for your cooperation and look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Sincerely, yours"
538,"I initiated a wire transfer from my account ( other bank ) to go to XXXX XXXX. The wire was sent on XX/XX/XXXX/18 to Wells Fargo to credit my XXXX XXXX for {$1600.00}.

WellsFargo Bank has not been cooperative during this unfortunate process.

I've never lost my phone, debit card, OR given out my personal information on the internet bank to anyone. Please please help me.."
543,"Wells Fargo gave me false information, leading to a loss of funds. I have the name of the person that gave me that false information. Wells Fargo is not making good on their, now, fraudulent statement. 

Here 's a more complete description of the whole situation : Our daughter listed a desk and hutch for sale on XXXX. Someone contacted her via email, and said that he preferred to communicate via text. He said that they would send the {$320.00} plus {$30.00} additional to hold the desk and to take down the ad. He then sent another text saying 'The check will be made in excess which will cover the movers money, we'll need your assistance in paying them when they arrive. Thanks ''. "" The check will be in full amount of {$1800.00}. {$350.00} for you and {$1400.00} goes to the movers. '' They notified our daughter on Monday XX/XX/XXXX, that the check had been mailed. He tracked it and knew when it was received by us. 

After receiving the check on XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX the name on the Cashiers Check ) to confirm that it was legit. They confirmed that it was in fact legit. I deposited it into our Wells Fargo account and called them the next day to confirm that it cleared. 

XXXX XXXX from Wells Fargo confirmed that the check had cleared. I asked him a number of times if there was any way that the check could be taken back, and he said that our account shows that the check has cleared and that the money is available to us right away. He said that there is no way that the check could be revoked. 

I then called the XXXX office of the FBI, because I was suspicious of the whole thing. He could not give me any advice, but didn't see any real signs of fraud except that the guy was paying so much to buy. desk and have it delivered. He said that if both banks confirmed that the check was legit, and Wells Fargo said that it had cleared, that he saw no fraud. I contacted the buyer and the delivery guy and they both individually told me that the buyer was in the process of moving and that the delivery company was picking up a number of things, and we would be the first stop. 

Since Wells Fargo told me that the check was cleared, on XX/XX/XXXX I sent the delivery guy {$500.00} ( the maximum that XXXX allowed in a 24 hour period, I found out later ). He had asked me to send two payments for some reason, one of {$500.00} and a second of {$990.00}. He probably knew of the XXXX {$500.00} limit. I told him that I would send the rest in 24 hour. The next day, XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to send the {$990.00}, but was only allowed to send {$500.00}, which I did. XXXX hours later, I received an email from Wells Fargo saying that the Cashiers Check has been returned and a {$12.00} fee charged to our account. That's how I found out that It was indeed a fraud. I tried to stop payment on the 2nd {$500.00}, but was only given a case number. 

I have documentation of every email and text sent from the buyer and the mover. I have documentation of my calls and emails to and from Wells Fargo, including the name of the guy from wells Fargo that confirmed that the check had cleared and could not be revoked. 

As of Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo has been mostly unresponsive to our phone calls, after we were promised returned calls and more research. Bottom line is that Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX told us that the check had cleared, was not revokable and that we could consider it OUR money."
545,"Today at XXXX, XXXX 2019 at XXXX I sent {$100.00} through my Wells Fargo app ( XXXX thats on the Wells Fargo app specifically ) to a person. I realized too late about the XXXX XXXX it does not assist with fraudulent and repayments. I am very devastated due to that and wish for some assistance to receive that back."
546,"Please note that Under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, which oversees electronic payment services, if an unauthorized person removes money from my account with XXXX, my bank must reimburse me as long as I report the fraud within 60 days after receiving my statement. In my case, I reported the fraud immediately. As such, I request that my money be reimbursed. 

Failure on Wells Fargos costumer service end to advise on adequate fraud steps, such as immediately close my compromised account and change the bank account number is not the costumers issues. I spent over an hour at the bank and several hours on the phone and the step to change my account number was not taken until I requested it days latercall logs are recorded. In comparison, other competitor banks took this step immediately. Additionally, upon adequate investigation Wells Fargo can tell that Ive never made a XXXX  payment to a thirds party not under my name. The fraud is clear and Wells Fargo failed to take precautions necessary to protect its costumers. 

Please note that according to the EFTA, if a financial institution breaks laws established by the EFTA, I may sue for damages in court. That is, if Wells Fargo refuses to credit the money back since Wells Fargo failed to prevent the transfer when I reported the fraud and told them to freeze the account. In this case, I am entitled to the money lost and potentially punitive damages between $ XXXX {$1000.00} as well as court fees and attorneys fees."

Some years later, we got a letter about unclaimed property. I followed up with this by going in to a Wells Fargo branch and spending 3 hours there.

Wells Fargo facilitated this by allowing a very suspicious chain of events. Most egregiously the beneficiary on my wire was "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. The account that it went into was in the name of XXXX XXXX, opened a week earlier. 

Wells Fargo made a cursory fraud phone call to me but did not mention the discrepancy in account names or any other reason to suspect fraud. Nor did they ask any questions that might have alerted me to the possible fraud. 

Wells Fargo refused to talk to me about this. My local police served them with a search warrant for account details. They provided the minimum and were not cooperative with the detective."

565,"COMPLAIN AGAINST WELLS FARGO ON ITS FAILURE TO PROTECT ME AGAINST SCAM. 
This is to bring to your notice that a bank I trusted enough to open a checking account with had failed in one of  its statutory responsibilities of protecting its customer against scams and fraudsters. 
Up until XX/XX/2018 I had a robust relationship with the bank but an event which began on that day had left me traumatized and lost hope in the financial institution- Wells Fargo XXXX 
I got a priority mail on the XX/XX/XXXX with an offer of Secret Shoppers job. A check of {$1300.00} was enclosed ( please see paper marked X1 and X5 ). In my innocence I thought I had gotten a job and I followed the instructions on the letter to the latter. 
I did a report as instructed ( X3 and X4. ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an alarming alert that my account had been overdrawn to the tune of {$1000.00}, the alert came at about XXXX and throughout that night I was unable to close my eyes wondering what could have gone wrong. On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX I made my way to the bank and it was then the bank told me that the check I lodged in was reversed and that it was fraudsters that had set me up. The receipts of the purchases from XXXX and XXXX is marked X7 with the cards I sent to the scammers as instructed by them. 
I was advised to put up a claim and I did. A photocopy of the check was given to me ( X5 ) and I went to the police station in XXXX XXXX to lodge a complaint. Officer XXXX XXXX with badge number XXXX attended to me and he expressed that the occurrence is a very common one. 
My grouse however with Wells Fargo is why would it give me money that was not available in the account of whoever issued the check? Does that mean anybody can issue a check without money in their account to the detriment of the check receiver? I know banks in this country that would withhold check for 24 hours in order to be sure it is not a bounced check, why would Wells Fargo not do the same? 
The staff that attended to me at the bank also attest to the fact that the bank witnesses such occurrence all the time and the question is, what measure has the bank put in place to checkmate this fraud, does that means scammers will be left out there to have their way and subject innocent customers to trauma and heart breaking situation? I got the letter ( X6 ) from the bank few days later and a claim was initiated but I was informed by the bank after some weeks that the claim was denied. 
Few weeks later, I got another priority mail from the same people with the same instruction but a higher amount on the check ( please see X2 ). ( The accompanied letter is the first 2 pages on the scanned documents ).  Apparently they felt the first one had scaled through so they launched another attack. I went straight to the bank to show the check and the letter, the bank made a photocopy of the check and gave me saying they needed to withdraw the original. I also went back to Officer XXXX XXXX who advised that I should just ignore it. Now my take on this is that if the bank had done the needful and the first check didnt go through, the scammers will not have the audacity to send another check to me. 
I am concern about my own reputation and I think the bank should also be concerned on how customers perceive its services. The incident made me to close my account because I lost confidence in the operation of the bank. Recently, the bank has been calling me that I am in debt and that is why I am putting up this official complain to defend myself and for the bank to live up to its responsibility of protecting its customers. Leaving its customers in the cold in the hands of scammers is sending a wrong signal about the reputation of the bank."
566,"My XXXX XXXX  account was closing, so I decided to bank with Wells Fargo instead. I made my initial deposit of {$1000.00} to them ( {$500.00} for Checking, {$500.00} for Savings ). 
I was accepted and they took the money, and only later come to find out that they closed my account ( s ) down for no reason. 
The issue I'm having is, they didn't even give me a check for the {$1000.00} I put into those accounts or made an attempt to reverse the transaction. I've called multiple representatives at Wells Fargo and I've told the same thing over and over, that the {$1000.00} was never put into the account. But this is a bold-faced lie. I have the Transaction Confirmation from XXXX XXXX  telling me differently ( with tracking numbers from with Wells Fargo 's name in it ) and they unlawfully took {$1000.00} without attempting to reach out and give it back to me. 
So in short, Wells Fargo owes me my missing {$1000.00}."
567,"On XX/XX/XXXX I used my Wells Fargo online banking to transfer {$1900.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) to Wells Fargo Bank. The transfer was successful and posted to my Wells Fargo checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX I received an email titled, "" Bank-to-Bank Transfer Unsuccessful from Wells Fargo '' The email stated the transfer was not successful with a reason of, "" XXXX Insufficient Funds ''. 

My first call to Wells Fargo was XXXX minutes and XXXX seconds ( of my time ) to tell me their system shows XXXX 's system rejected the transfer due to insufficient funds. They let me know there was nothing they could do to help and referred me to XXXX. 

I reached out to a family member to loan me money to avoid my mortgage payment being rejected. This caused additional stress and embarrassment. 

I reached out to XXXX  via chat. Their first response to my inquiry was, "" I show that amount being withdrawn from your account on XX/XX/XXXX. I do not show record of it being returned. If you would like I can provide you with the trace number that you can give to them [ Wells Fargo ] to research with! '' The representative then provided me with this tracer number. 

I then called Wells Fargo back. This call was XXXX minutes and XXXX seconds ( of my time ). The first representative let me know there was nothing that could be done and that her system was showing it was rejected. I ended up asking for a supervisor. She did not get me a supervisor, but instead, escalated me to her, second level of support. I spoke with XXXX more individuals insisting that I had the money in XXXX and that XXXX was insisting they did not reject it. I offered the tracer number XXXX. Finally, the last individual I spoke to offered to file a research claim. My confidence is low that this will resolve the issue. 

As of today, the money is not in either of the accounts. I would assume it will show back up in XXXX and I will have to spend more of my time to get it back to Wells Fargo due to scheduled payments that will be coming out. 

At this point I do not know if the error was on Wells Fargos end or XXXX."

On XX/XX/17 I looked on my online banking and saw that they did put that amount in and so swiped my credit card that Wells Fargo did not catch this security breach of my identity and allowed a card that technically had the amount in it by was not cashed yet. XXXX supports legal rights of the banking company to dispute all charged, fees, and loss of my personal money that was In their. Wells Fargo states it 's impossible for scammers to get my online banking login information, without me telling them! I have supported documents to prove that statement false by XXXX. I 've talked to many Wells Fargo reps, been in store with managers, made police report, made lawyer aware and still they refuse to budge. Stating that i did give the scammer my login information which is a accusation that is discriminating with no facts to support Wells Fargo Accusations. I had to call wells Fargo yo find out my account has been overreacted the amount that I saw was available. Also I did not know it was sent through my online banking because no alert was made and figured they wired it to my account, which is why I made sure the funds were in my checking that were authorized and to run my debit with pin knowing my card would n't go through if the check did n't because of having only {$200.00} in my checking at the time. They corrupted my credit score to retired and false work information that prevents me to get any other credit line since that 's what I needed in the beginning before I became more XXXX for lack of security attention."
579,"On XX/XX/2021, my small business account at Wells Fargo received a wire transfer of approximately {$31000.00}. I then used these funds to complete a purchase for the customer. On XX/XX/2021, Wells Fargo debited my account, emptied out all the funds, without my knowledge or consent. If they had any doubts, they could have contacted me when the funds were received. Having the wrong account name but the correct account number, is not a reason for them to return the funds without contacting me, or obtaining my debit authorization. 

Under Uniform Commercial Code 4-A-207, if a beneficiary 's name does not match the account number provided on a payment order received by the beneficiary bank, and "" the beneficiary bank does not know that the name and number refer to different persons, it may rely on the number as the proper identification of the beneficiary of the order.

In Wells Fargo Wire Transfer agreement, "" if a wire transfer request describes the person to receive the wire transfer ( the "" beneficiary '' ) inconsistently by name and account number, the wire transfer may be made on the basis of the account number, even if the account number identifies a person different from the Beneficiary. If a wire transfer request describes a financial institution inconsistently by name and identification number, the identification number may be relied upon as the proper identification."
580,"On XX/XX/2021 at XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX I attempted a withdrawal at an ATM ( XXXX ) for {$350.00}. It asked me whether I wanted it in XXXX  or XXXX  dollar bills. I requested for 50 's however when the machine dispensed the money it gave me XXXX  XXXX dollar bills as if they were XXXX dollar bills giving me {$140.00} dollars instead of the {$350.00}. 

Immediately after on XX/XX/2021 at XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX I attempted to retry and withdraw again since I really needed the money. This time I attempted to withdraw {$400.00} but with the intent of requesting XXXX dollar bills however when I clicked on the amount I wanted to withdraw it DID NOT allow me to choose how I wanted to receive the requested amount ( If I wanted XXXX or XXXX dollar bills ). It gave me XXXX  XXXX dollar bills for a total of {$160.00} instead of the {$400.00}. In total I received {$300.00} but was short {$450.00} from my account. 

I called Wells Fargo immediately at XXXX XXXX to see what could be done because nothing like this has ever happened to me. Since it was XXXX customer service told me the only thing they could do was file a claim and wait 5-10 business days. On XX/XX/2021 I received an email notifying me that my claim had been settled. When I called they told me that they found no error and that my claim was denied. I requested to appeal the claim but I was denied that as well. 

I called customer service and their claims department numerous times, six to be exact. Each time telling me there was nothing they could do. They were able to get a supervisor to talk to me and all they could do was file a complaint about customer service. Eventually they told me that another supervisor from the claims department would call me and see what they could do in the next 24 to 48 hours. I waited and I have yet to get any call from them since. 

I asked for an appointment with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2021 on Sunday XX/XX/XXXX since it was was the earliest available date. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX a personal banker at XXXX and XXXX  tried to help me and see what actions I could take to resolve this matter. When he called they told him that they only checked the cameras to see if I was the one who authorized the transaction and sent someone to count the ATM to see if it was short. Since I was the one who authorized the transaction and they said the ATM was not short they concluded that there was no error. 

My issue with this however is that while I did authorize the transaction that is not what I am disputing here. I counted the money in front of the ATM both times and the camera will very clearly show not only me counting the money but also show that they were in fact XXXX dollar bills instead of XXXX dollar bills. Also since I received less than the requested amount the ATM would be over not short."

Unfortunately, I am not aware if Wells Fargo business practice does this but once the funds was return in my account, Wells Fargo immediately did a bank withdrawal reversal on XX/XX/2021 and sent the XXXX dollars out of my account without my authorization back to XXXX XXXX 

I submitted a claim to the Wells Fargo online department and spoken to several representatives about the matter, after their investigation I receive several letters that appear to be conflicting about the transaction error. The letters states that were no account errors on my end and the transaction was done correctly. Another letter I receive is states I did not have the funds and is very misleading and conflicting. I continue to call and request detail information, such as an financial audit transaction, but have not receive it. From my conversation and understanding, Wells Fargo assure me there was no error of insufficient funds on my part and confirmed the funds requested for bank to bank transfer were in my account. I am concerned after speaking to XXXX XXXX they confirmed that their bank return the XXXX funds on XX/XX/2021 but has not receive the second transaction from Wells Fargo reversal process. Can someone please assist me in this matter, its been over 2 months and I have not gotten this issue resolved.

This fraudulent agent said someone was attempting to send {$3500.00} through my WF AppXXXX , and that the way to ensure we prevent that was to XXXX myself and "" reverse '' the transaction. The fraudster accessed my mobile banking app without my knowledge and was sending one-time text codes to my cell phone and asked me to read the code back to them. This is a known Wells Fargo authentication practice used with me in the past, and I was under the impression at the time I was speaking to WF representative. The fraudster had me push through the {$3500.00} transaction, then asked me to change the recipient to his bosses name to reverse the payment. I attempted to do so, and was limited to a {$500.00} transaction. I started to become suspicious that this was not in fact Wells Fargo, and hung up the call. I called the fraud department back the following day to follow up and was told I was speaking to a fraudulent representative. Wells Fargo has denied three claims I have submitted attempting to recover the funds, though they sent out a mass email to all WF users on XX/XX/XXXX identifying this as a popular scam on the rise, called the "" Pay Yourself '' scam. This is a known issue and scam, and I am still being denied any repayment by Wells Fargo. Timeline with case details, dates, and WF representatives involved can be found below.

Another text came reading the following : "" Wells Fargo Bank Fraud Dept : Thank You No Further Action Is Needed A Customer Service Representative Will Be Contacting You Shortly @ XXXX ''. Shortly following this message, the call came in, I answered and a man who said he is a WF representative explained that there had been unauthorized transfers from my checking account using XXXX to a XXXX XXXX XXXX account. He then told me to sign on to my online banking account, register my and phone number to be a recipient in XXXX, and then send the money back to myself to reverse the unauthorized transfers. I did so, first, in the amount of {$1500.00} and again in the amount of {$1000.00}. After doing this, I went back to my checking account and noticed that the amount was gone and asked the rep what happened to my money and that I didn't understand what was going on. The rep then got his "" manager '' who told me I needed to make another transfer because the other two may not have gone through. At this point, I realized I was being scammed, hung up and immediately called actual Wells Fargo to report the scam. They opened up a claim for each transaction amount and told me they would investigate and if the claims were substantiated, they would provide me with a credit for the amounts in 10 business days. I heard nothing after 10 business days, so I called this afternoon ( XX/XX/2022 ) ( business day 11 ), to check the status of my claims. That is when the WF fraud rep told me that the claims were investigated and that I authorized the transfers so they would not be giving me a credit despite being a victim of an apparent and well known scam. The rep then explained the only thing they could do was request Bank XXXX XXXX send back the money, and if XXXX agreed, WF would issue me the credit. I then asked to speak with someone in WF 's escalation division and was connected with another rep who explains the same info as did the previous rep. He eventually offered to file a customer complaint on my behalf with WF about the bank 's policy on erroneous XXXX transfers, and informed that letters were being sent to me regarding the outcome of WF 's investigations of my claims."

Apparently someone had opened an account with the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and had my money from Wells Fargo transferred to that account.They told me it would take 10 business days to investigate my claim. I called everyday to stay on top of this and to get additional information as to how this could have happened. Finally on the 11th day I called Wells Fargo as no one had contacted me, it was then that they informed me that my fraud claim was closed and denied. Claiming it was done by me through my device based on the IP address. Obviously my phone was hacked because i did not authorize or do this, nor does anyone have access to my accounts. It clearly states on google that that your IP address can be hacked and your device can be taken over. I am single parent and this was the money I was saving to fix my furnace, why would I transfer all the money i had to an account in XXXX and leave myself with nothing? I just do not know what to do at this point? Any assistance you can provide me would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

On XX/XX/XXXX I realized I had been a VICTIM of theft. I contacted Wells Fargo immediately. I even went to a local branch BEGGING someone to help me. 
Instead of helping me, Wells Fargo let their criminal customer walk out the door with {$140000.00} of my hard earned money before they did anything to stop him. Wells Fargo hasnt even been helpful to the police department who has a search warrant. 
Wells Fargo does not care about poor people like me. They only care about rich people and criminals."
602,"I have 4 stolen checks that were deposited likely using some kind of mobile app, to a Wells Fargo account. The checks were made out to 4 different persons or entity, and successfully cashed through  Wells Fargo by a person named XXXX XXXX. 
There are no bank markings, deposit stamps, or any form of identification on the checks that were cashed. It appears these checks were deposited using a mobile device app offered by Wells Fargo [ and I understand also XXXX offers this "" convenience '' ]. There is no positive i.d . required. So the thief just puts the money in his account, waits for the check to clear, then draws it out. This system of making deposits MUST STOP. It is not going to work. I have not been unable to get any cooperation from Wells Fargo in tagging the thief, which they can easily do. Perhaps there is someone inside the bank working with him. 
I have filed all the reports I can locally with the County and DA. You need to pick this up and get Wells Fargo to cure this easy fraud. Anyone can do this, any time, any where. This is a very BAD situation for us as account holders issuing paychecks and payments on account by check."

607,"Back in XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo speaking to a XXXX XXXX about applying for a new 0 % APR promotional card. I was asked to call back in XX/XX/XXXX as last years promotion was still applied to my account ending in XXXX and would not be able to process the promotion until then. I called on XX/XX/XXXXt and spoke with an XXXX XXXX at Wells Fargo. I asked her to check and make sure 0 % APR would be approved if I applied for a card. I was told yes. We applied for the card over the phone and was approved for {$5000.00}. I wanted to increase the limit of the card to {$15000.00}. XXXX and I moved money around from my other cards ending in XXXX and XXXX and was able to raise the balance to {$14000.00} on my 0 % APR card ending in XXXX. We closed account XXXX to absorb the total limit into my XXXX account. XXXX and I were told that I would have to wait until I received and activated the card to continue the balance transfer. Later that week in XX/XX/XXXX I received the card and activated it. I called XXXX at Wells Fargo and did a 3-way call between her and the Credit Bureau. The woman we were speaking to kept misunderstanding what accounts we were trying to transfer from and had to correct her multiple times. Enough times that even XXXX, my banker, was getting fed up with this other associate and stepped in for me to clarify what needed done. In the end the balance transfer request goes through. XXXX offers to call me back on the XX/XX/XXXX to follow up and make sure the transfer went through. For a week and a half I see no balance transfer go through. I call XXXX on the XX/XX/XXXX to see what happened. Wells Fargo Credit Bureau tried doing a balance transfer from account XXXX instead of XXXX and since the account is closed no money was transferred. I told XXXX to let me look through my letters and see if I can find the super checks that I assumed were sent for XXXX. I found some and told XXXX I would just take these to the bank and write the Supercheck myself for {$13000.00}. I go to my local bank and have the check deposited into my checking account. The following business day I transfer money in my checking account to other Wells Fargo accounts to bring other balances down which brought my checking account approximately down to {$2000.00}. All is good. On XX/XX/XXXX I receive and e-mail at XXXX stating my account has gone negative {$11000.00} and some change and overdraft fees were assessed. I call the bank immediately and ask what's going on. I speak to customer service rep who can't figure out what's going on with my accounts. The accounts aren't showing 0 % APR and he has to involve his supervisor. His supervisor says he has to create a ticket for this as the Executor has to look into why account XXXX doesn't have the promotional offer. I receive a call the next day stating that I shouldn't have received a 0 % APR offer and it will have to go through another customer service branch at Wells Fargo to be resolved. I speak to a XXXX and I was told this can take days to resolve. I have bills due on the XX/XX/XXXX and a house payment due on the XX/XX/XXXX of every month and stated this to them. My checking account of negative {$11000.00} pulls 3 overdraft fees of {$35.00} by XX/XX/XXXX and I have to pull on my personal line of credit for {$13000.00} to make sure I have enough funds to pay bills and house payment. I've had one overdraft fee in the 10 years I've banked with Wells Fargo and that was about 10 years ago. XXXX called me on XX/XX/XXXX stating that Wells Fargo will honor the 0 % APR promotional offer on the card ending in XXXX but will only pay for half of my overdraft fees because the Supercheck was written by me even though I tried to do a balance transfer over the phone which was done incorrectly or not at all and I took the initiative to take this to a local branch which was looking at my accounts when the Supercheck was wrote and proceeded to transfer money from my closed account of XXXX to my checking account."
609,"I am a customer associated with the Wells Fargo Bank.

610,"On XX/XX/2018, Someone from a forum offered me to a pair of shoes for {$400.00}, I sent {$200.00} to the person via XXXX using my Wells fargo checking account as initial payment, and I will pay the rest once I have the valid tracking number for the shipment in the afternoon. That person told me that the package has been dropped off at UPS. I checked the tracking online, but nothing shown up yet, the person told me to wait for one day. so on XX/XX/18, I checked the tracking number online again, nothing shown up either, so I figured out that the tracking number was fake, it was a scam. and I tried to contact the person, but he never answer my text message or any contacts. I called my bank which is the Walls Fargo to stop the payment, and their representative informed me that the payment can not be stopped because it was finalized already. I told him that I was got scammed, needs to stop the payment to protect myself. he refused and said nothing they can do at this point. I was very frastrated, and asked Wells Fargo agent at least twice about XXXX  transfer, he told me that I will not get my money back. the bank disconnected the call."

After being on the phone with them for 2 1/2 hours they are saying an investigation has to be done and we will not have our money back until it is complete. HOWWW are they allowed to do this when it was reported to them that her identity was stolen and they did not take the proper measures to protect our account! This has to be an inside job!!! How is this even allowed!

But there has been no contact from XXXX XXXX since I asked for a refund. When I called Wells Fargo, I was told that there was no guaranty that I would get the money back The supervisor was super rude and hung up on me when I asked why XXXX is in their app if they don't back it"

I have made complaints to Wells Fargo, both in a Wells Fargo bank as well as through the consumer financial protection bureau, who failed to uphold the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), Regulation E, and denying me reimbursement under the false pretenses. The entire interaction and results falls under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), Regulation E which grants me the right to be reimbursed by Wells Fargo to cover the loss."
618,"Looked for one ticket to purchase for the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Found a post on XXXX. Used text messaging to contact the person. He then proceeded to tell me he has two tickets. I happened to find two posts on XXXX with the same description inside of the post, yet different phone numbers to contact. Person told me that's his girlfriend 's post. 
He texted me a picture he took on his laptop with the g-mail email pulled up of the XXXX XXXX order ( order # XXXX XXXX ) .I asked for proof of drivers license or ID. He sent me a "" selfie '' holding up his California DL with address blacked out. I did the same, sent him a DL selfie with my address blacked out as well. His DL name matched the name on the email he previously sent the picture of to me. 
He asked what bank I use, I told him Wells Fargo. He gave me the email to add him so I can transfer money through XXXX online on Wells Fargo. 
He asked for half money upfront. I agreed, sent {$250.00} first. 
About an hour later his girlfriend used his phone to text me a picture of the same email order showing the XXXX XXXX Tickets with just my name changed on top. I asked for another better picture showing the date/time on the laptop and they sent that image as well 10 mins later.

It didn't seem right but she said she doesn't want to get scammed and she will send me the confirmation email once I send the second half of the payment. I then proceeded to send another {$250.00}. I waited 30/40 mins and all he/she could text me was "" Still waiting on the Wells Fargo email that you sent the money ''. 
I then told them I had to go to sleep I work very early in the morning and I trust that I'll wake up to the text and email confirmation that the ticket has been transferred. 
I woke up with no email or text from them. I then proceeded to do even more research about XXXX transferring XXXX XXXX tickets. I called Wells Fargo in the morning, they could not provide me any information about the person. I called XXXX and there's nothing they could do either. I reported this incident on IC3.gov as an internet crime. I reached out to XXXX and they don't take responsibility because I went through Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo blames XXXX and so the cycle continues with no resolution."

The person who initiated the transaction never delivered the tickets and stole my {$200.00} and stopped communicating with me. We then checked from a different phone number to see if he still "" had tickets '' and of course he offered the same deal to our request- continuing to scam other people.

Please file a police report. '' And they also gave me a case number that they said we could use to check up on. We created a police report and have yet to hear anything about it. So we waited, called Wells Fargo back, and then were told that, "" The person who gave you that information was wrong, and there is no such case number with our fraud division, it looks like you made a money movement claim.

624,"Case statement Good afternoon on XX/XX/2020, I requested to make an international electronic transfer ( International Wire ) through Wells Fargo Bank ( I have a savings / debit account at said bank ) for a total sum of {$20000.00} US dollars to a bank account ( XXXX XXXX ) in XXXX on behalf of my brother. 
Once the request for the operation ( international Wire ) was processed with my bank details and those of my beneficiary, I requested a printed document specifying the Exchange Rate or monetary equivalence of the Dollar = XXXX XXXX to know how much I should receive my beneficiary in your bank account. To which the Advisor / account representative gave me a printed format with the amount in dollars ( XXXX ) and the fee for the operation charge ( XXXX dollars ) but the exchange rate only wrote it to me by hand ( XXXX dollar = XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) for which my beneficiary is supposed to receive a total in XXXX XXXX  of {$430000.00} for the total of {$20000.00} dollars. Failing that, my beneficiary received only {$390000.00} pesos, that is, I lost {$36000.00} pesos ( the loss in dollars at the exchange rate that the lady told me of XXXX XXXX XXXX  for each dollar would be : {$1600.00} dollars ). Something that seems excessive to me given that I also paid a fee of XXXX dollars for the service. 
I insisted that he provide me with this type of change printed and not handwritten by the Account Executive who attended me, but she told me that her system did not produce that report, to which I told her that earlier this year I accompanied a friend to carry out a similar operation for {$13000.00} dollars in another bank ( XXXX XXXX ) and they did give him a printed sheet ( I have a photo of said document ) specifying the amount in XXXX XXXX that the beneficiary would receive for that amount of dollars. And indeed, the beneficiary did receive that amount. Without any variation, respecting the exchange rate at the time the procedure was carried out. 
Situation that I expected to happen with my case in Wells Fargo. Unfortunately it was not like that. 

The transfer was reflected in my beneficiary 's account on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, but since the amount did not match what he was supposed to have received ( and in what we tried to determine if it was my transfer ) Later days ( Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX ) I went to the branch again to try to clarify with the lady who attended me when making the transfer the reason why I had received such a lower amount and she only told me that at the time the Wire passed the guy The exchange rate had dropped ( to XXXX pesos for each dollar ) to which I told him that for that reason I had requested by printed document the amount that my beneficiary would receive. And she alone wrote it to me by hand ( Exchange rate XXXX pesos x XXXX dollars = {$430000.00} XXXX XXXX  ) And given that "" logic '' that it had been because the exchange rate fell, I told him what would have happened otherwise. What would have happened if the Exchange rate would have risen? Soon the bank was going to deposit more money than the XXXX that it was supposed to receive, to which the lady told me that that would never happen. 
To which I said : that is to say that I can lose XXXX dollars for the operation but in case the exchange rate had increased and therefore the money that my beneficiary would receive then there they would adjust to the exchange rate set on the document, the one for {$21.00}? It does not make me fair at all, it is more I consider it an abuse. 

And I left the bank branch thanking the attention. 

For your attention, I am grateful."
630,"My father, who has a Wells Fargo account, wired me me {$5000.00} USD two times into my Wells Fargo account. Once on the XX/XX/XXXX and once on XX/XX/XXXX. Only one {$5000.00} transfer was completed, and the other one has not yet arrived as of XX/XX/XXXX. 

It is not an error on our part, such as typing in the wrong information, as the information was already saved in Wells Fargo 's system. And as additional proof, one of the {$5000.00} arrived promptly and the other {$5000.00} was sent using the exact same information. This is obviously an error on Wells Fargo 's part. 

My father contacted Wells Fargo and are very uncooperative. They've initiated a trace, but whenever we contact they are very dismissive and try to brush the issue aside. They are also unwilling to refer us to higher ups who can answer our questions. Since the money was transferred from one Wells Fargo account to another, tracing it should be very easy. I needed this money a long time ago and the longer I wait, the more damaging it is to me."
631,"On XX/XX/2020 I authorized XXXXXXXX XXXX, custodian of my Health Savings Account, to pull {$3000.00} from checking account at Wells Fargo Bank.

These two micro pulls were immediately refunded back to my checking account The next day, XX/XX/2020 {$3000.00} was pulled from my checking account with ACH transaction # XXXX and applied to my HSA account. On XX/XX/2020 I received an Email from XXXX XXXX stating. 

"" Please be advised that your deposit amount of {$3000.00} made to your Health Savings Account on XX/XX/2020 has been debited from your account. The funds were debited, as funding to cover this deposit was not received from the bank on which the check was drawn. '' I immediately called Wells Fargo. On XXXX they provided me with the ACH transaction number which I then provided to XXXX shortly thereafter. My bank statement for that time period clearly shows the {$3000.00} dollars being pulled from my checking account. 

For months I went back and forth with XXXX about where the $ $ ended up. Finally on XX/XX/2020 I received the following email from XXXX. 

"" Our Finance Team has confirmed that the transaction in the amount of {$3000.00} was manually rejected due to NO external bank account at the time of the transaction. From the research, it was determined that the transaction belonged to you.

I am finally giving up on them and submitting this complaint hoping that the CFPB can force the two banks to talk to each and find my {$3000.00}.

Upon research I realized it was a scam and called my bank however they said the wire had already been sent to Wells Fargo but they would put a freeze on it and all my accounts and for me to go to my bank 1st thing the next morning and explain and close all my accounts and re-open new ones, I did this and was htere for 3 hours then returned back to my office and spent another 4 hours filing a police report, reporting identity theft and reporting it to the credit bureau. On XX/XX/2022 XXXX  from Wells Fargo called me to confirm wire and specifically told him "" DO NOT SEND THIS IS A FRAUD '' He said the money had not been sent and gave me a reference number but my bank had to request the funds back in writing.

He put me in touch with XXXX XXXX the purported head of the Anti-Fraud Department at XXXX XXXX. He confirmed that XXXX hackers had infiltrated my XXXX XXXX accounts, and that I needed to sell all of my stocks and securities, and make a large transfer to my Wells Fargo account. They would maintain high security on this account, and by moving the money we would thwart the hackers. XXXX claimed they did this all the time, and it was nearly always successful.

The small branch bank didnt have that much cash. XXXX said to try to get {$6000.00} instead. While talking to the teller, I mentioned the wire transfer attempts. The manager told me there was no indication of any wire transfer attempts that morning. This made me highly suspicious. I bought XXXX with the {$6000.00} and transferred it to a XXXX XXXX  provided by XXXX XXXX. I thought about all of this, confronted XXXX XXXX by text, and called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX and reported in detail that Id been the victim of fraud on my debit card, on my checking account, and at two branch banks where I had made cash withdrawals in service of a massive and brazen fraud I was the victim of. 

XXXX was a smooth talker, seemed to be acting on behalf of XXXX, his explanations were artful and I trusted him, until I didnt anymore and called Wells Fargo XXXX let them know Id been the victim of an Authorized Push Payment fraud. It is not clear what if anything Wells Fargo will do to reimburse me for the various aspects of this fraud. I think the XXXX, XXXX XXXX, gift cards, XXXX etc loss was about {$7000.00}. I think the transfer of funds from XXXX to Wells Fargo and subsequent cash withdrawals from banks and conversion to XXXX placed on XXXX XXXX XXXX wallets loss was about {$33000.00}. My total loss from this 2-week fraud, and the total amount I need to be reimbursed for is about {$40000.00}. I cant afford to lose this money. I am retired and I need all of it to live on.

I contacted XXXX, they said there was nothing they could do because they processed and sent the funds. No one is able to help me. XXXX confirmed that they have not received a notice from Wells Fargo regarding any returned transfer."
655,"I was trying to purchase a dog for my mother that she found on line, the price of the animal was to be {$600.00} with shipping from allegedly Montana. I was speaking with the guy over the phone trying to gauge some sort of authenticity about him. I checked the website also trying to avoid being scammed. Since I was not sure or trusting I reached out to my banking institution, Wells Fargo for some clarity and assurance about making said transaction via XXXX on XX/XX/2020. the gentleman that I spoke with told me that my money would be covered if I did not get what I was purchasing after I explained what my issue was with the seller. After I was assured by my bank that I was protected I proceeded with the transaction over 2 days time sending {$500.00} on the XXXX of XX/XX/2020 and {$100.00} on the XXXX to XXXX XXXX. Shortly after I started getting the run around about the dog. Then I called Wells Fargo to dispute which went well, they told me give it 7 to 10 days for the matter to be resolved. I then reached out to them again and now they are telling me it is nothing they can do because I initiated the transaction even after talking to a supervisor. They also apologized for the first guy giving me false information but its out their control. My issue is had I not been given the assurance from them the transaction would not have been made because I was already suspect of fraud. So now I'm out of {$600.00}, can someone please help?"
656,"In order to close on our home purchase, went into local bank to send a wire transfer. After waiting and worrying we find out that the bank sent the wire without an account number. Told us what we needed to do, and we sent another wire successfully. We still have not received our money back from the initial wire, and the bank and employees arent offering any solution to tell me where my missing $ XXXX are. Can not get an update other than we arent sure"
657,"On XX/XX/2021, I got a message from a number claiming to be Wells Fargo, detailing that someone had committed fraud on my account. This number was XXXX. Upon answering NO to if it was an authorized transaction, I got a phone call from what appeared to be Wells Fargo from the caller ID. I heard the automated Wells Fargo message and was connected to a representative by the name of XXXX XXXX. He explained that in order to secure my account, I needed to transfer funds to myself. I transferred {$3500.00} as well as {$500.00} for a total of {$4000.00}. Once I had realized what had happened, I brought this up to my bank. I had an understanding that due to Regulation E, customers were still entitled to a refund or compensation even when tricked to give personal information. They have denied my claim, even though after reaching out to others, I found out that a similar scam happened to a friend using XXXX and was able to get his money back in a week."
658,"On XX/XX/18 I sent a {$500.00} transfer to someone using XXXX through my Wells Fargo account. I agreed to buy concert tickets from a XXXX ad and the seller did not transfer tickets to my account as promised. I have the listing and all documentation saved for this transaction. He sent me the confirmation as "" proof '' of the tickets. I had suggested using XXXX to do the transaction but the seller said he preferred using XXXX as this was done directly from bank account to account and there would be no issues. After money was transferred he explained to me that he had transferred the tickets electronically to my XXXX account. I did not receive anything and the seller stopped responding and blocked me. I called Wells Fargo within minutes of making the transfer. The Wells Fargo website says that transfers could be cancelled as long as they were still in the pending status. My account said the transfer was still pending so I talked to a representative but she said it was too late to cancel the transaction. She told me that there was really nothing she could do at that point. I asked her what she suggested I do as I believed this to be fraud and she had no answer for me. I have an email address, phone number and name for the seller but have not received any help in this matter. The seller answered a message from my cousin just minutes later saying the tickets were still available. I would just like help from the bank in this situation to get my money back from this thief as they clearly have this persons personal information. I was obviously not the only victim."
659,"Over the course of two weeks I sent money to a unit manager who was renting an apartment in DC through XXXX. I was sent a renter 's application and lease. These forms seemed legitimate and I went ahead and signed the lease. This decision was made without seeing the apartment because of the stay-at-home ordinance placed due to COVID-19. After receiving the signed lease, the unit XXXX requested wire transfers for the cost of rent, deposit, and renter 's insurance. The total amount of money sent was {$11000.00} and was sent to two accounts, one with XXXX  XXXX XXXX and a second with XXXX XXXX. After receiving the payments the unit manager requested additional payment for rent. When I requested to speak over the phone regarding the latest request, they no longer responded. I found a phone number listed under their name online and called to find the unit manager was impersonating the unit manager of the apartment. I realized I was scammed and immediately reached out to the local police department to file a report. I reached out to Wells Fargo to file a claim. Wells Fargo has since denied my claim and I am waiting for the resolution of the police investigation."
660,I made a wire transfer from my account with Wells Fargo to a XXXX car dealership in XXXX on XX/XX/2020. The transfer was supposed to be complete by XX/XX/2020. It is now XX/XX/2020 and the transfer has yet to be completed. An internal investigation with Wells Fargo has been started ( case # XXXX ) but have not heard anything from my bank.
661,"I withdrew money from my retirement account with XXXX XXXX. I was issued a check on XX/XX/XXXX, it was received signed and mailed to my bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( not located in my state ). Placed in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX in a priority mail envelope. XXXX made aware check was not received by my bank abd iwas told it was cashed. Check was stolen in the mail. USPS police notified. XXXX then sent copy of check to me and affidavit of forgery was filed. From thence i was told it could take up to 120 days to hear from Wells Fargo. I followed up with XXXX every one to two weeks and informed that "" Wells Fargo has not responded ''. I called today XX/XX/XXXX to find out the status and was told that as of XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo denied the claim because the check was endorsed by me originally. I was never notified by XXXX. I was given the phone # to Wells Fargo Fraud dept. XXXX. I was told Wells Fargo was unable to help me because I do not have an account with them, however they did inform me that this was not handled properly and that XXXX should re-file because it is illegal to cash a dually endorsed check. Can you please help me with this process."
662,"I was scammed into believing that I was being helped. I bank with Wells Fargo. 

A man had written me a check for {$2200.00}. He said I could keep XXXX of it as long as I sent the remainder to a "" colleague '' through XXXX. On XX/XX/2020 I had sent over the first transaction for {$500.00}. Then the next two days I had also sent an additional {$500.00} both days totalling {$1500.00} for all three. On XX/XX/2020, the check that I had deposited was marked item returned unpaid and my account was down in the negatives. I immediately filed a claim with wells fargo. For a week, I did not hear from them. Then I was receiving all of these emails and notifications for bank fees, during which I had no money. Then today, XX/XX/XXXX, I was locked out of my online banking. For hours, I had to gain access to my account again. During a final phone call of the day, the woman on the phone with wells fargo had told me that there was nothing they could do since it was authorized through XXXX. I do not find this to be fair or just that a scammer can get away with my {$1500.00}. I had asked if I could at least get all of the bank fees that had occured due to not having sufficient funds on my account, but I was not granted so."
664,"On XX/XX/XXXX I used XXXX XXXX to wire money to a friend to place an order. Later that day I was informed by my friend that he could not place the order so he returned the money using XXXX XXXX. I was alerted by XXXX XXXX that I had the money in my account. I selected to have the money transferred to my bank ( Wells Fargo ). When checking my Wells Fargo checking account a week later I noticed that the money was not in my account. I then requested that was Wells Fargo look into this matter, so I put in a Claim with Wells Fargo. I received a formal letter from Wells Fargo stating that there's nothing that they can do and that they claim was closed. I requested a from XXXX XXXX to speak to a person on the phone as to receipt of posting the money to the Wells Fargo account and I received nothing from Wells Fargo. I made several attempts to reach XXXX XXXX XXXX  by way of email phone texts and I have not received anything from them. I also reached out to my friend to provide proof that the money was taken out of their account and wired to me by way of XXXX XXXX. the proof that I currently have is text messages back and forth to my friend and documentation provided by XXXX XXXX on my cellular phone. I also have documentation where Wells Fargo withdrew the money the next day but did not provide me a refund on my account.

665,"I purchased cosmetics from XXXX by Wells Fargo debit card in XX/XX/2017. And I cancelled the debit card in XX/XX/2017. But I returned cosmetics to XXXX and XXXX refunded money to Wells Fargo my cancelled account on XX/XX/2017. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo confirmed it has received my refund money from XXXX but failed to locate the money. I filed 3 claims to ask wells fargo to give me the refund money back to me. But wells fargo closed my claim by other irrelative excuses. I kept calling wells fargo claim center 5 times after my claim was closed. The claim customer representatives promised me twice to send me the check of refund money but they never put on actions. Last week I called wells fargo claim representative again and was told my money has been transferred back to XXXX in XX/XX/2017 and I should call XXXX. But the fact is the transaction records wells fargo transfer money to XXXX in XX/XX/2017 are my original purchasing cosmetic from XXXX not the ones Wells Fargo return the refund money to XXXX. Wells Fargo doesn't have any evidence to prove it returned money to XXXX but also doesn't want to give my money back to me just solely telling me XXXX has my money."
666,"I am a customer of Wells Fargo bank. I have been scammed by a person named XXXX XXXX who is also a Wells Fargo bank customer because he sent me a XXXX request of {$450.00} on XX/XX/2019, and in the description of the money request, they put "" XXXX XXXX ''. In my XXXX activity the scammer has requested 2 times {$900.00}, but were not satisfied. However ; I have never ordered anything online, neither a laptop. So the transaction was processed. I checked my emails the following day and saw my transaction report and immediately called Wells Fargo for Fraud alert since I did not make the transaction. Wells Fargo also denied my request and never refunded me anything. I sent them 3 mails. And they replied me with no change on the denials. They did even further investigate, like trying to reach out the Scammer.  I, in my side got the number of the ser through the XXXX report, called the number. The 1st time, it ringed, but no answer. The 2nd time, it was not going through. The person has shut off their phone. Here is the phone number of XXXX XXXX : XXXX. It is a Michigan code. So they might be from Michigan. After this incidence, XXXX had delivered to my address a box which was in which there was 100 piece of screws. The box weighted 2.30lbs on XXXX label. I still have the box here, and will send you photos and everything. 
Here is the detail on the box delivered by XXXX to my address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Michigan, XXXX Weight = 2.30lbs 183 12 x 6 The sender of box is XXXX XXXX XXXX who is totally different than the name on my XXXX transaction report. That person who toke the {$460.00} out of my checking account is XXXX XXXX. 2 persons involved in this case. It looks it is an group of scammers who are doing this. 
When I received that box, I realized that someone was smart and scamming me with a fake box. So, I immediately called Wells Fargo Fraud department to report that. Because for me, there is a correlation between my XXXX Scam and the box full of screws that I have received. 
After that I sent a letter to the bank, they responded again with a denial of refunding me my money. I am a XXXX Personnel, I will not tolerate to strive to serve the country and some scammers will be stilling my money in my bank account. The bank did not care. 

So, after investigation in my side, I realized that one of old friend has used my old computer and logged into my account and got scammed in a laptop purchase through "" Let 's go app ''. The scammer used a fake identity and fake number using "" XXXX XXXX '' to hide their phone number. However ; I got the exact phone number where my money went which is XXXX. 

So what I need is my money back from Wells Fargo bank since they have all the information of the sacammer who is XXXX XXXX, so that they can reach out them. 

Sincerely,"
668,"I recently got off the phone with my previous employer, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, on XX/XX/XXXX in attempts of starting my rollover process only to find out that they closed my account. I spoke to XXXX, the current holder of my 401k, prior to this conversation to begin the process and had everything done and finished with them. The representative was so kind to even guide me through their website, helping me make any adjustments necessary to match my needs and start my rollover. I only needed to speak to Wells Fago. 

So I spoke to Wells Fargo. Again. 

I actually spoke to a representative on XX/XX/XXXX to begin the process, but the representative wasn't very willing to help me out. Only a few minutes was spent on the call as I explained to the representative that I was unable to log into my retirement account. I've tried logging in multiple times but each time it would spring up as an unknown error and to call the representative. When I called, the representative told me to simply go onto the main webpage and enroll there since I didn't officially have any Wells Fargo accounts. I only had a team member account, one that I quickly realized that I no longer have access to. 

Without further help on the matter or any attempt to help start my rollover right then and there, she disconnected and I went online to register. I ended up being unable to register due to some technical error in the system, I ended up doing the same thing that I'd attempted to do earlier, and even now the issue remains unresolved. 

I decided to try again and give Wells Fargo a call again today, XX/XX/XXXX. After being transfered from representative to representative, I was able to talk to someone who was able to pull up my account, although it wasn't very much of a conversation. She told me that I was issued a check just a few days earlier, XX/XX/XXXX, a week after my attempt to begin my rollover with the other representative. Informing me that my previous balance was now cut by a few hundred dollars and that I will be charged penalty fees for not meeting the deadline that I was never informed of. 

I remained patient and willing to wait as she looked up my files and asked her if there was anything I could do to get the rollover started since I've spoken to the representative before and had issues logging in but the representative remained stern and gave me no further options. At the end of the conversation, she had the audacity to ask whether or not I was willing to start a retirement account with Wells Fargo and that she'd be happy to help me start one. 

Throughout the entire process I felt as though I received no help at all from Wells Fargo on the matter, I was only turned to opening new accounts with them each time. Unaware and uninformed, Wells Fargo stripped me of the money that I've been building with them as a dedicated team member."
669,XX/XX/2018 - I was informed that non-account holders can no longer deposit cash into Wells Fargo accounts per Wells Fargo 's policy
670,"On XX/XX/2020 I transferred {$250.00} from my Wells Fargo checking account via XXXX through the mobile app to my own XXXX  XXXX XXXX account. I called XXXX   XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX  on the morning of the XXXX to see if it was anything I could do and if the transaction would take a little time to come through. XXXX  XXXX XXXX informed me that the transaction failed and they never received the money from Wells Fargo. So I then contacted Wells Fargo at about XXXX XXXX to start my claims process to get my money back. Wells Fargo informed me that since my rent payment was due the following day that they would mark my case as urgent and I should hear from the person on working the claim shortly. Fast forward, I called every business day to get a resolution. On Friday XX/XX/2020 I called in to check the status and was told my claim had been closed and I was just out of my money. I immediately went to the Wells Fargo branch to speak with a personal banker. I went into her office and she called the customer service or claims department to check and see if my claim had indeed been closed and they informed her that it hadnt. I showed her my bank statement from XXXX   XXXX XXXX and she verified that the deposit of {$250.00} had not been deposited in my XXXX  XXXX XXXX account and relayed that info to the customer service rep. Still no resolution. They told her it was nothing they could do and I would still have to wait 10 business days before a resolution could be made. I called in this morning XX/XX/2020 and now they are telling me that still no resolution. Ive been patient and given them all the documentation needed to verify that I never received my own funds that I was transferring between MY personal accounts as if Im a criminal and it wasnt MY money to move. This is unacceptable and extremely unprofessional."
676,"An unauthorized amount of money {$170.00} was taken from my account and put in XXXX to a an unknown user, XXXX XXXX, at XXXX on XX/XX/18. My bank account has faced several security breaches in the past, including an unauthorized XXXX charge in XX/XX/2018, an unauthorized XXXX Charge in XX/XX/2018 totaling about {$20.00} each. As soon as I realized a huge sum of money was missing from my account I called Wells Fargo and asked them to freeze my account so the funds would not be transferred, and I explained to them that this transfer was not initiated by me, and must be a hack consistent with the other security breaches. They shut down that bank account completely and I opened a new one. However, they refused to freeze my funds or return the money to me, and said that through XXXX, payments can not be cancelled and that I must have authorized the transaction. I was in dire need of that money as a student and it was stolen from me. I have not had any new charges of fraud since opening this new bank account, so I believe my old one was just completely compromised and the final scam attempt was their big one. I feel duped and ashamed that the money I worked hard for at only XXXX years old was snatched from me. I called Wells Fargo and they said they could do nothing at all for me, and that if I wanted to file an appeal, it would be a complex process of scanning documents, a handwritten letter sent by post to California from my Florida address. I felt as if it was disingenuous and intentionally designed to discourage me. I did not have such resources. It is only in doing research recently that I realized I could file a grievance with the Consumer Finance Bureau, which I tried to do right away."
677,"On XX/XX/18 I deposited XXXX into a Wells Fargo savings account to a person who posted an ad stating they were renting out there property for a vacation rental. The person who created this account is a fraud/scammer and since the deposit the account has been closed or there are no funds available. I have filed a report with with Wells Fargo bank in XXXX CTwith XXXX XXXX and the Wells Fargo fraud Dept. I also filed with local police in the town where I reside. I have a case number also. I went to Wells Fargo in XXXX CT to report that I was scammed and I would like to get my money back from the branch I made the cash deposit to in XXXX, CT. Wells Fargo did not issue my cash deposit money back. I also have my receipt of that transaction."
679,"On XX/XX/XXXX I found a XXXX post for 4 tickets @ {$100.00} each to the XXXX playoff game XXXX XXXX vs XXXX XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX. I texted the contact phone number for the listing and the person said the tickets were still available. He asked if I was familiar with quick pay with XXXX and XXXX. I said I knew XXXX, but not familiar with XXXX. I found out that Wells Fargo had XXXX incorporated into my account, which made me comfortable that I was using a namebrand bank to support this in case something went wrong. So, I transferred {$400.00} via XXXX from my Wells Fargo bank account to his email : XXXX I actually spoke to him and he said his name was XXXX XXXX and that he had tickets for his kids, but wasn't able to go. So, I transferred the money and confirmed he received the money via text. 

He then asked for my email address to transfer the tickets. He said they would come momentarily, but they never came and no further response my repeated calls and texts. 

I called Wells Fargo IMMEDIATELY to stop the transfer and report the fraud. They said they would get the process started, however I just received a letter from them that they had done an investigation and discovered that their transfer was not in error. I hadn't asked them to investigate that, but rather informed the agent that I was scammed and needed the transfer to be reversed IMMEDIATELY, but they said they would have to complete an investigation first. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter stating that the investigation was complete and they would continue to investigate. When I called the Wells Fargo Help Number the kind women stated that they investigated the transaction to determine if Wells Fargo or XXXX had made a mistake. I stated that I was submitting fraud or theft and they said I should contact my local police department as XXXX didn't have that function. What!!!??? a namebrand bank doesn't protect users from Fraud or  Theft? Needless to say, I am upset. I submitted a case to XXXX as well and want to file a complaint to CFPB as this type of Fraud seems to be increasing at an ALARMING rate and that Wells Fargo should inform its users so that they aren't victimized like I was and many many others. 

Summary : XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX for Football Tickets ( XXXX XXXX vs XXXX   XXXX ) contacted user at @ XXXX Transferred {$400.00} to XXXX Seller on Friday XX/XX/XXXX Upon confirming funds were received, I requested the tickets Seller asked for my email address, which I gave No tickets were transferred to my XXXX account and no response to any of my texts or calls that night"
680,"I was told that "" billpay '' takes 6 working days guarenteed. It took 26 days. Called through out the time to try to get people to make sure soemthign was happening but the bill pay check didn't arrive until it was too late for me to stop what has happened since. Wells Fargo the bank I have a complaint with did nothing and to resolve it said that I was not the sender of the money so had no right to complain. Yet I was the recipient waiting for the funds to go to an escrow account to complete a property transaction. That has cost me tens of thousands of dollars as a result of being 20 days late and NO ONE AT WELLS FARGO CARES. dismissed me as irrelevent. 
What is a Guarenteed payment time if no one cares when it arrives and the persobn recieving is told they do not count as part of the transaction."
682,"On XX/XX/2019 I purchased ( 2 ) tickets in the amount of {$450.00} from a XXXX user. I sent the money through my bank, Wells Fargo using the pay app XXXX to user XXXX. The user sent me a confirmation screen shot of the payment to XXXX XXXX account number ending in XXXX. I was told the tickets would be in my XXXX account on Thursday XX/XX/2019. On the morning of the XX/XX/XXXX I was messaged from XXXX under phone number XXXX to let her know when the tickets were in my account. I waited all day and when I got home from work I began messaging XXXX to say they are not in my account. XXXX again said she was going to call the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX she then stated that nobody was answering the phone and that I could try calling. The time now was after XXXX XXXX and the ticket office was closed. XXXX stated that if they had not transferred by Friday XX/XX/XXXX to call her and that she would refund my money. I called the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX on Friday XX/XX/XXXX to see if there were any tickets being transferred to my email of XXXX and the agent stated that there was nothing transferred or pending for that email account. I then reached out to XXXX again at XXXX via text and call and there was no response. I called my bank ( Wells Fargo ) that evening and was told that there was nothing they could do and to try to reach out to the seller. I emailed XXXX XXXX customer support to find out anything and to see if my money could be returned and that went without answer."
683,"I was contacted by a "" friend '', XXXX XXXX, on XXXX and he asked if I saw his post that you could earn money. He told me to contact XXXX and she would help me to earn money. I contacted a mutual friend and he confirmed this opportunity was real. XXXX asked me to send {$1000.00} via XXXX ( XX/XX/22 ) which I did and she said let 's continue talking via XXXX. Next she said congrats you can withdraw the money but first I needed to join XXXX I created an account and then they started sending emails. At this point I saw money they deposited to my account, {$1000.00} and they sent a code to my email but it didn't work. I contacted XXXX and she told me I needed to send {$1500.00} in order to get my money out and this would put me on a higher "" level ''. I talked to my friends and they confirmed this was "" so real ''. I'm thinking this really is my friends and didn't realize my friends had been hacked. Since the code didn't work, XXXX told me to go an ATM and send the money through XXXX. The machine didn't work so a friend helped me by letting me deposit into his account and then send the {$1500.00} through his XXXX Then I called my friend XXXX through XXXX and found out it was NOT him and that several of his friends went through the same thing. I continued to receive texts to send more money but I did not send any more. I realize now that because I need money it was easy form them to play on my emotions."
685,I made a money transfer using the app XXXX through my bank which is Wells Fargo. I was purchasing a XXXX puppy from XXXX   XXXX  supposedly in XXXX Texas. The money was received by the so called breeder but I never received the puppy. I then got an email from the company that was supposed to be the courier that would be delivering my puppy saying I had to pay them XXXX for an electronic thermal crate because the crate the breeder used was not safe. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX is the name of that company. I sent them numerous emails because I started to feel like I was being scammed. They told me I would have to send the funds by debit card only by XXXX XXXX and the fee would be returned to me when my puppy reached my door. I knew then something was up. They told me that my puppy was being held at their facility until they received my XXXX for their crate. I refused to send the money and they said my puppy would be held there until they got the money so they were in on the scam as well. I simply feel that my bank should not support a company like XXXX when they know what XXXX 's policies are and if something happens the customer doesn't have any recourse through XXXX or even my own bank. I have been a customer with Wells Fargo for over 20 years and for them to treat me this way is just horrible in my opinion. I called them the minute I realized I had been scammed and they said there was nothing they could do for me and that I was just out the {$550.00} I paid for a puppy I never received. They said that using XXXX is like just sending cash but that can not be true because it still has to go through the bank. I just feel the bank let me down and they should not allow XXXX to be a part of their business practices.
686,"XX/XX/XXXX, I was in the XXXX XXXX XXXX and a girl sent me a check for her security deposit. However, she sent over {$3000.00} and claimed it was also for her leasing car. So I transferred {$1800.00} since my balance was showing the authorized transaction of {$3000.00} already. However, after 12 hours, I looked back, the bank revoked my check, and I lost that amount of money that I transferred. The bank here is Wells Fargo. However, I believe the situation is universal to all banks. They will deposit your check right away, and scammers use this way to try to make you transfer the money before the check got bumped out. And Wells Fargo did not try to help me since it was my act to transfer the amount. However, the check was cleared on their system, only after then I transfer the money. This is a flaw that should not be in the banking system at all."
687,"I rented an apartment through XXXX that turned out to be a scam. I did my due diligence as well as I could, but transferred {$3000.00} to the scammer through XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. When I arrived in XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, the apartment was not even owned by the scammer in question. I reported it to the police in XXXX XXXX. I assumed that XXXX had fraud protection, since it was sent through Wells Fargo, my bank, but it didn't. I looked into how to get the money back but since it went through before I knew it was a scam, there is no way to dispute it."
688,I made an international transfer from the XXXX to XXXX with wells Fargo as the intermediary bank on XXXX of XX/XX/2020. Wells Fargo has held up the funds for no reason and re not responding thereby delaying XXXX for my cousin
690,"The attached letter to Wells Fargo explains the problem in detail. When this letter was sent to Wells Fargo, it was initially ignored. It was sent again, with help from a local news station, and this time I received a response from the bank stating that they will never refund me any money from this."
691,"On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX pm : voicemail message from Wells Fargo Bank Fraud alert department. XXXX pm : email message for fraud alert of an attempted transaction from my checking account with Wells Fargo. I called to say it was not authorized by me but the wait time was an hour. Within that hour, a call came in from the same Wells Fargo number : ( XXXX ) XXXX. I was asked if I had made a transaction for {$110.00} at XXXX XXXX. I asked how I could be sure the caller was from Wells Fargo. He said the number on my caller i.d . was on the bank 's website. That was true. I did not authorize the {$110.00} attempted transaction which was reimbursed instantly to my online account. I turned off my ATM card myself online and securely logged off. 
The caller said he would set up alerts on my account. He sent me text messages during our call. Each one had a code that I read back to him. Each one said : Wells Fargo will NEVER call or text you for this code. DON'T share it. Enter code XXXX online to change your password. I was not online and did not do this. 
Next, came a message that I had added a new XXXX recipient, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I do not know this person. I told the caller. He said that was one of the alerts I had not seen previously. 
Next two text codes, XXXX and XXXX, said to enter online ( I was not online ) to send {$290.00} and {$300.00}. I did not approve this, and I did not go online to do this transaction. Not then, not ever. The caller said Wells Fargo would send me an email link within 30 minutes to change my password and account information. We hung up. 
Then another call came from the same Wells Fargo XXXX number. I verified it was me but was abruptly cut off. Immediately a call came from ( XXXX ) XXXX. I recognized the same caller by his foreign accent. He said he needed to add XXXX more code XXXX by text that had the same Wells Fargo warning and directions : enter the code online to send {$300.00}. I was not online and did not enter this code or any of the other codes. Ever! I never went to my online account during the phone call. 
The link from Wells Fargo did not come. An email alert came that my account had fallen to $ XXXX money stolen had been a direct deposit earlier on the same day from social security XXXX XXXX source of income at age XXXX. 
Immediately, I called the XXXX department XXXX Wells Fargo. It took XXXX hours to close the account, and file a claim that I will hear the results of by letter within 10 days. Wells Fargo will not take responsibility for my loss from their banking institution though I am a twenty-year account holder. 
I filed a complaint with the "" resolution '' department because Wells Fargo did not stand behind me the account holder. I asked to speak to an official. I have been placed in a call back queue and have not received that call. While I was filing the complain over the phone, an email came saying that I had changed how I want to have my statements delivered. I did not request a change from online to mail. The statements will go to someone other than me, I suspect. 
Note : The New York XXXX reported on this fraud in a news report a week prior to this happening to me exactly as described by others in that news story. 
XXXX is supported by XXXX major banks that have added it to their online banking platform. These banks are not standing behind their clients when illegal wire transfers are made from the accounts they hold as fiduciaries for others. 
This is a clear case of fraud. It is wire fraud. It is a crime."
695,"I don't know really how to begin. Please tell me there has to be a better way. 

My spouse died 3 years ago, an estate was established in his name. To my regret we did not have a will. 

Thru the help of attorneys and probate court the estate is established. Estate of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX cant remember all the details, but this is what I do remember. It has been such a long and drawn out process. 

The estate is established, and after it is completed I get an email from the bank Wells Fargo, that states do you want to go paperless or hard copy. I ask initially for hard copy. I find a bank account with my husbands name on it. I have to go back to the attorney and go go back to probate and establish and amend a 706 form. 

I tried to go back to the bank to close the account, dropped it after I felt like I was meeting obstacles. It was emotionally exhausting. I proceed to pick it up again about a month ago. We have been customers of Wells Fargo for over 20 years. I have now been at the bank, visiting it weekly. Each time its is something else that I need to provide to prove that I am the wife of the deceased party. 

With each visit, the branch starts with conversations with the Estate department of Wells Fargo, and each time they want information that they have. They ask for his death certificate, and they had it. I submit the 706 form and they now tell it it is old and the fiduciary status is expired. I explain to them that if this was accepted a year ago this would of never been an issue. And i am upset, because not once was i told what I needed to assist to resolve the issue. i decided to bring in all and any legal paperwork that would prove that I am the wife of the deceased individual. 

We get no where. The branch manager, escalates the issue. I decide to call and speak to someone in the Estate department of Wells Fargo and they tell me to bring an updated fiduciary form into the bank. I do what they tell me and with each visit branch speaks to their estate department. With each visit the bank tells me that their Estate department is asking for another process. 

With one of the visits, the bank finally processes a check and I cant deposit. it The check is made out to the Estate of XXXX XXXX, and now the Estate is closed at the bank because it is in my name.

I return this past week and now am being told they can re open the Estate, but I need a tax id number. The bank manager asks me if I have one, and i never knew there was one on the account. They have to reopen the estate in order to put the check into the account. Who knows what steps I have to do next? The check is in my bag, and I cant do anything with it. The check is in the amount of XXXX dollars. 

My frustration is from multiple issues. I am the one who found the account after I asked for all hard copies be sent to me. When the Estate was being established, the search by the bank should of found this account in the first place. I still have my husbands name on my checking and savings account and have not removed it. I would think that the powers that be should be able to see that I am not a person trying "" steal '' the money. I actually dont know what the bank is thinking.

I want the check deposited into my bank account without reopening the estate. I dont think this can happen, so I will be making another appointment with the bank, providing an EIN number. Oddly enough, the Estate legal department cant see that i have the death certificate, 706 forms, cremation bills, and continue to have his name on my checking/savings account, and they cant process or close the account or write the check out to me. 

There has to be a better way? A way that can ensure a smoother transition for an event such as this. This is has been a very difficult arduous process. I write this to hopefully helps someone else who is processing this situation. I have left the bank, each time, emotionally exhausted. All for processing a check for XXXX. 

The bank has every piece of paper in their hands to show that XXXX was my spouse. I never thought of providing my marriage certificate, perhaps they would need that as well, after all why would I own his death certificate."
696,"On XX/XX/XXXX, My husband and I did a wire transfer in the amount of {$57000.00} from XXXX XXXX  with a Personal Banker by the name of XXXX XXXX.

My last 3 phone calls were on Friday XX/XX/XXXX in which I get them the  XXXX Wire  transfer number so that they can pull the payment and apply it to the loan. I haven't gotten any guidance on the time it will take to find this money and pay off the mortgage and now I am worried as to where the money is. The XXXX customer service team has not been able to help me find these funds or provide a timeline for payoff. I have asked to speak to a manager and they told me that one will call me in 24/48 hours. I am worried that now there is a late fee assigned to this loan and also if I make the mortgage payment for my father in law that this will throw everything off. 
I need help and am not getting anywhere. One customer service rep XXXX NMLS ID when asked she would not provide this for me. What can I do to find this money, avoid any more fees and get some guidance.

The XXXX account I used, as I'd later learn, can receive funds from the US only, which means the fund at Wells Fargo will be returned.

She didnt send me the item but received my funds through XXXX app. Im trying to recover my funds which amounted to {$500.00} on XX/XX/20. I made a claim with my financial institution and they denied my claim. I wasnt able to retrieve the information I needed to file a complaint to the recipient bank. Because the recipient bank is affiliated with the XXXX app. They stated that they dont work with online app transfer of funds. I am filing a complaint to receive the funds that have been wrongfully taken from me. I also spoke to a representative from XXXX to try to recover the funds but they were not able to assist. Please help!
703,"Dear Sirs. 
A XXXX citizen permanently resident in XXXX contacts you. I have a conflict with Wells Fargo bank regarding my {$4000.00}, which I ask for your help in resolving. The essence of this conflict is as follows. 
I am a law-abiding citizen, a XXXX and a XXXX person, regularly pay all taxes. The amount of {$4000.00} is very large for me, and I have been saving it for more than three years because it is equivalent to my net income for one and a half years. At the end of XX/XX/2019, in order to purchase XXXX presents for me, I wanted to transfer this money from my dollar account in XXXX to my friend in the USA on his current account with Wells Fargo bank. But due to technical errors of the employees of my bank in XXXX, the operation was performed in the amount of XXXX zlotys from my other current account. Accordingly, the amount was sent about 4 times less than I wanted. After discovering this error, my bank, with my consent, returned this amount of XXXX zlotys to my current account in XXXX, and on XX/XX/2019 I again sent the correct amount of XXXX dollars to the USA. But for some reason, this money was not credited to my friends bank account in the USA for a long time. I began to worry and on XXXX demanded through my bank a refund of this amount of XXXX dollars. However, the return was not made within a reasonable time. Therefore, on XX/XX/2019, I wrote an email to Wells Fargo bank in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX, Senior Executive Vice President, Community Banking and Consumer Lending. But as a result of XX/XX/2019, I received a completely empty answer from another employee of this bank with a proposal to call her on the phone. I am a XXXX  citizen and XXXX, I dont have money to call the USA. Therefore, on XX/XX/2019, I filed an appeal with my bank and, just before XXXX, on XX/XX/2019, I received a response from my bank instead of a gift, which simply shocked me with its contents, that according to information received from the correspondent bank, the Wells Fargo bank refuses to return the money. Thus, Wells Fargo bank, with which I do not even have partnerships, has appropriated all my savings in more than three years. An employee of my bank in XXXX recommended that I contact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for help."
704,"On XX/XX/2022 my husband was tricked by a scammer to send {$490.00} via XXXX. During the phone call, he realized what was happening and he hung up and immediately called our bank, Wells Fargo. The hold time to speak to someone at Wells Fargo was 40 minutes. By the time he was able to tell a Wells Fargo banker that he did not authorize the transaction, he was told it was too late. The banker took down all of the information and said he would open an investigation. On XX/XX/2022 I called the bank because the {$490.00} withdrawal was still in the "" pending '' section of our bank account. I wanted to make sure Wells Fargo was aware that we did not want this transaction to go through. I was told an investigation was underway. On XX/XX/2022 I called Wells Fargo to inquire about the process and was told the investigation was closed, no fraud had occurred as my husband authorized the transaction. On XX/XX/2022 we received two letters from Wells Fargo saying they had completed their investigation and there was nothing they could do. On XX/XX/2022 I contacted Wells Fargo corporate office and on XX/XX/2022 I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating that she would be looking into the matter. On XX/XX/2022 XXXX called me on the telephone and stated that there was nothing Wells Fargo could do, the money had already been transferred. I asked what measures Wells Fargo has in place to protect us in this type of situation. She said XXXX transfers are instantaneous. I asked why there have been no protection measures put in place when it has been publicized in the news that the banks have set these transfer processes up themselves. I also asked why we had to wait on hold for 40 minutes when if Wells Fargo 's customer service had answered in a timely manner they could have stopped the transaction. She responded that they are busy and they are dealing with a lot of scams. On XX/XX/2022 I asked that the denial be put in writing. On XX/XX/2022 XXXX XXXX sent me an email apologizing for the lengthy wait time and providing me with information to learn more about how to avoid being scammed in the future."
708,"On XX/XX/2022, I was scammed out of {$3100.00} through XXXX. The scammer text me, and then called me from a "" Wells Fargo '' number, and pretended to be a Wells Fargo bank representative, and scammed me out of my money by getting me to transfer money to them. I immediately reported it to Wells Fargo, who investigated, confirmed the scam, but refused to return my money to me. They stated that the transfers were authorized by me, and closed my claim. I researched EFT Act and found Regulation E. I called back and mentioned Reg. E to them, but they still refused to return my money, claiming that my situation is not considered an unauthorized transfer and doesn't fall under Reg. E. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , my case meets the Reg E. definition of unauthorized transfers. Wells Fargo has continued to deny this, has given me the run-a-round about my claim, and has continued to refuse to return my money. By law, I'm supposed to get my money back, but they are refusing to return it. Please help me."
711,"On XX/XX/2018 at XXXX XXXX, I sent {$0.00} to XXXX through XXXX. I then sent {$190.00} to the same address at XXXX XXXX. The money was sent to pay for concert tickets. I authorized payment in order to receive the tickets. Once receiving the tickets for the XXXX XXXX concert on XX/XX/18 at XXXX, arriving at the venue, finding out the tickets were fraudulent, and talking to police I called my bank at XXXX. The bank proceeded to tell me that they were unable to do anything due to me authorizing the transaction and I should only use XXXX between family and friends. The only way I was allowed to send money to receive the tickets I thought I was purchasing was to authorize the transaction before my entire transaction was complete. There was no way of knowing that I was being scammed before authorizing the payment."
713,"Complaint Against : Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX Issue : Fraudulent Refund Check for Expired XXXX XXXX Money Order I mailed an expired {$500.00} XXXX XXXX Money Order to XXXX XXXX with the XXXX XXXX refund form. 

I received a {$470.00} Wells Fargo check as a refund for an expired {$500.00} XXXX XXXX money order. 

I deposited the check into my Wells Fargo checking account on XX/XX/2019 and it was returned, unpaid, on XX/XX/2019. 

I am requesting a 100 % refund of the {$500.00} paid with a Bank/Cashier 's check. 

There has been no reply from either XXXX XXXX or Wells Fargo. 

It appears that both XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo are in a conspiracy to not pay refunds for expired money orders."
714,On XX/XX/XXXX I purchased 4 tickets to the XXXX  vs. XXXX game. I paid the seller the agreed amount of {$500.00} via XXXX through my Wells Fargo app. As soon as I sent the money via XXXX the seller came back and said I owed an additional {$100.00}. I immediately contacted my bank to notify them of the fraudulent transaction. They opened a case ( Claim # XXXX ) and assured me they would handle it and I would hear back within 10 business days. This morning I followed up to check on the status and was told my claim was rejected. I find this extremely disheartening especially since I called Wells Fargo within minutes of making the transaction. XXXX must have a record of the sellers bank account and should be able to recoup these funds. It's horrible that these predators are able to take money without any repercussions. It is illegal and should be handled appropriately!
715,"On XX/XX/2018 I transferred {$1500.00} to my daughter 's Wells Fargo account registered on my Wells Fargo mobile banking app. I received a confirmation email to this effect. Days later up until a week my daughter didn't receive this money, I called Wells Fargo customer service to figure out what the problem was and they told me the money was in XXXX XXXX XXXX. I told them my daughter does not have a XXXX  XXXX XXXX account so I was a bit worried as to what was going on. I asked them to investigate, they checked, traced it and told me the money was in an account in XXXX XXXX XXXX with the same FIRST and LAST NAME as my daughter 's. I wondered how this was possible and told them to investigate further so they helped file a claim. 

On XX/XX/XXXX they sent me a letter saying they determined if the error was on their part but it wasn't and it was on my part so they are closing the claim. We confirmed the email registered on the account and it was the same email address as my daughter 's but without the last name ( my daughter 's email address ; XXXX while the other customer in XXXX XXXX XXXX is ; XXXX ) This was when we realized I made a mistake because bear in mind they both have the same first and last name. I am XXXX years old with XXXX XXXX and sometimes I am in excruciating pain so I do make mistakes sometimes like we all do, even the Bank does too. 

In another letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo promised to help take necessary steps to service this claim one of which was ; Attempt to  contact the financial institution involved and provide a financial institution with information they need to locate the transaction. 
So I decided to call the bank again the day I received the letter, we were going back and forth, the Customer Service agent was very rude, I had to give my daughter the phone to speak with the lady so she could understand me all to no avail. I called again and spoke to another person who was able to furnish me with a tracing number for XXXX XXXX XXXX and asked me to call XXXX  XXXX XXXX. 

This customer service agent also further investigated and realized I had sent {$150.00} to this same XXXX  XXXX XXXX customer which I didn't realize, the same way I thought I sent money to my daughter no wonder my daughter never got that money ; I had no choice that to send another {$150.00} to her using her account number ( I have proof of all these transactions ) this customer service agent called my attention to this. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX and they told me to ask Wells Fargo to contact them based on Financial institution to Financial institution that they can not give me any information on a customer in their Bank. 

The following day I went to a Wells Fargo branch to speak to a Banker, he was willing to help and he opened a new claim for me this was first week in XX/XX/2018. on XX/XX/2018 Wells Fargo sent another letter to me closing my claim saying there is nothing they can do about it. I called the customer service asking them to try to contact XXXX  XXXX XXXX on my behalf after all even though I made a mistake the money in question still belongs to me and the bank should be able to help me retrieve this money from XXXX XXXX XXXX being a customer with Wells Fargo for a long time. They still kept on saying there is nothing they can do about it. My question to Wells Fargo and any other person who works very hard and pays taxes is this ; Can you let {$1500.00} and {$150.00} of your money go into someone else ' account by mistake and not do anything about it? 

I am really in need of money I had to borrow for my daughter to pay for her certificate online now I am in debt and all I am asking Wells Fargo to do is to please help me retrieve my money back from the account in XXXX XXXX XXXX. This is the reason why i am asking CFPB to help me."
716,"On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, one unauthorized transaction occurred on each day. The first unauthorized transaction had a sum of {$500.00} and the second transaction had a sum of {$300.00}. Both transactions were accomplished through XXXX to a completely random email. I called the very same day to dispute the transactions with my bank ( Wells Fargo ). They told me they will file a claim and the issue should be resolved within 10 days ( Both transactions at the time were pending ). I called the next day to have my account number and online banking account replaced to prevent any more possible unauthorized transactions. I also mentioned to the specialist to make note my email that is tied to my online banking account has been under multiple attempts to sign in from other people besides me ( I have the XXXX alerts ). The specialist said this would benefit my case as this can mean my account was hacked. After 14 days when I first made the claim ( today ), I called to see what was going on with the claim. That is when they told me my claim was denied for I made both transactions and I was trying to trick the system. The account that received the amount is now unregistered with XXXX which makes it even more suspicious that it was not me who approved the transfer."
719,"On XX/XX/2017 morning, I went to the Wells Fargo Branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX. I deposited a $ XXXX check to transfer money from my XXXX checking account to my Wells Fargo saving account. It took 10 mins to get done. After that, I went to the XXXX branch next to Wells Fargo branch in the same plaza. I deposited another $ XXXX check to transfer money from the same XXXX   account to my XXXX saving account. 

On XX/XX/2017, $ XXXX was deducted from my XXXX account. XXXX was great and I immediately saw the $ XXXX new money in my XXXX saving account. However, Wells Fargo was keeping holding my $ XXXX money for extra 10 days. Until ten days later, I finally saw the new money in my Wells Fargo saving account. 

During that ten days, I reached out to Wells Fargo local branch and also the corporation representatives. None of them gave me a solution. I clearly felt that they just tried to hold my money as long as possible. 

Conclusion : Wells Fargo cheated and took advantage from consumers. More importantly, I am not the only case, the same activities are still happening on my friends. I want to make this issue public so that other consumers won't be trapped by Wells Fargo."
720,"Part of the letter I sent to Wells Fargo Bank in an attempt to resolve the issue : I am writing to you regarding the above matter in which Wells Fargo Bank apparently held/diverted money I deposited into the account of XXXX a customer of Wells Fargo into Collection. The above {$1000.00} was purposely deposited into this account to be used to fund a youth sports team in my home country The XXXX who needed financial support to travel overseas for a competition. They needed help at the last minute because the funds they were expecting got entangled in the bureaucratic government web. I received a call from the team leadership frantically asking for my temporary support until they can get things hatched out. The team was set to travel within a few days. 
Out of love for my country and concern for the youth who would have been devasted had the trip been canceled, I asked for an account in which to deposit the funds through XXXX. The account number of XXXX was given to me by one of the teams managers and we tried to reach out to him to verify details. Once I was given the green light, I disbursed funds from my own account at XXXX  as you already know putting on hold a very important project I was working on. 

It turned that the account holderXXXX owed Wells Fargo some overdraft fees in excess of {$1000.00} and that the account was either suspended or closed. For Wells Fargo to have total disregard of my situation and hold on to these funds because they were deposited into a closed account or one in Collection shows the type of corporation Wells Fargo is. It is illegal to hold my money hostage in a dispute that doesnt involve me. Wells Fargo doesnt have a very reputable name in the public domain and I intend to send my complaint to a reputable news outlet if this situation isnt amicably resolved within 30 days of this letter. {$1000.00} is a lot of money and it was through hard work that I got this money."
722,"This is an addendum to CFPB complaint # XXXX RE : CFPB Case # XXXX CFPB Case # XXXX In regards to the complaint about Wells Fargo filed XX/XX/XXXX, I believe the second case # ... XXXX may be the same complaint forwarded from the Federal Reserve Consumer Help, although I'm not sure. I would like to add onto the complaint as I'm worried that Wells Fargo is going to again make an unauthorized transfer from my sister 's account. They keep sending letters to my sister 's address in XXXX XXXX but they eventually get forwarded to me. They know I'm power of attorney over her financial affairs but insist upon keeping me out of the loop, especially when it comes to her VISA account where much of the fraudulent activity seems to originate. My sister called Wells Fargo when we visited her recently to take care of some paperwork and told them she approved and wanted me to be able to access her VISA account in order to monitor it. They have continued to ignore both the legal POA document and my sister 's spoken directive. 

My sister is a retired XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX County and has a XXXX state pension and Social Security, but no nest egg due to unauthorized transactions/fraud that have occurred to her account over many years. She has no children to monitor her physical or financial well being and I've been brought into the picture late in the game as her only surviving relative. In the meantime, I am trying to assess the damage done and put a stop to fraudulent activities in order to pay for her medical bills. Wells Fargo has been anything but helpful, to put it mildly. 

I keep getting letters forwarded from Wells Fargo, addressed to my sister, which reference case numbers that I have not heard of nor has anyone spoken to me about them ( attached letters ). This is making me nervous they're going to attempt another unauthorized transfer of money to her VISA account. They did the {$7500.00} unauthorized "" transfer reversal '' on XX/XX/XXXX, referencing XXXX Case # XXXX, which I have not seen nor has any paperwork been sent to my sister. When questioned they said they did it because of my complaint and they were not required to notify me or my sister. The letters attached ( dated XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX ) show complaints about the {$5000.00} unauthorized cash advance from VISA on XX/XX/XXXX and the subsequent fraud by XXXX XXXX XXXX . There is no reference to a {$2500.00} unauthorized cash advance. I don't know if this complaint was manufactured for cover to tap her account for {$7500.00} but it's troubling that we were not notified nor aware of these actions until we saw it on her bank account transactions. I now have a forwarded letter to my sister, dated XX/XX/XXXX, from Wells Fargo referencing an inquiry into her VISA dated XX/XX/XXXX, case # XXXX. I also have an email from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/XXXX, case # XXXX, referencing another inquiry into her VISA. I have no idea what these are about. My sister has been in a XXXX facility during this time so, if I wasn't physically present to facilitate a phone call, she would not have made these inquiries, whatever they are. Without visibility into her account, I'm afraid this could be a setup for more unauthorized "" transfer reversals. '' BTW the {$7500.00} Wells Fargo took from her account was there because we had to sell her car in order to provide a financial cushion for her extensive, and as of this point unknown, medical needs. It's totally sick that they took that and then had the gall to say they didn't have to tell me, the only person she has trying to safeguard her health. 

I hope this gives you a fuller picture of where we stand on this matter and, hopefully, something can be done before my sister is out of money and options. 

Thank you for any help you can provide. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX P. S. : As a result of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau notifying Wells Fargo about this complaint, we got a call today from Wells Fargo, XXXX XXXX. in XXXX XXXX.

The following Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo gave me a call and said there was fraudulent activity on my debit card of {$15.00} and they wanted to alert me. That transaction was blocked and they cancelled this debit card immediately. Right after, I called the XXXX precinct in New York to file an official report and they said that could not be done because where the crime happened ( via my phone and computer while I was at work ) was not local. I called the XXXX precinct ( area where I was working while I paid via my phone ) and no one picked up, so I left a voicemail, and they did not get back to me. I called my financial advisor and he told me to call XXXX. I called XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and I could not even get on the phone with a real person because they insisted it was an issue with Wells Fargo and not them personally.

On Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to send money to a friend of mine in the amount of {$85.00} using XXXX. When I hit submit, it prompted me to validate my information. 

The same problem happened back in XX/XX/XXXX. I have already validated my information. I have had the same phone number and devise for over five years now, and nothing has changed. 
I called Wells Fargo, and nobody is taking accountability on this issue. As far as they are concerned, once the ticket is open, I will have to wait for ten days to get it resolved. Most likely, no one at the bank will call or follow up with me, and I did all the follow-ups. So, the ten days to solve their technical glitch is not valid. 
I am the one who does all the follow-ups. Otherwise, the bank will not let me know if they solve this issue or not. The bank must take the accountability and make sure the XXXX programming issue on the backend is working to avoid the same issue repeatedly. 

This is my XXXX XXXX # : XXXX. This was opened on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I appreciate you looking into this matter. 
Please advise.

739,"YOUR COMPLAINT To give you the general idea, my mother was conned into making a large wire to her "" boyfriend 's '' overseas friends. They used fake identity 's to pick up the funds. This is covered under regulation XXXX 's error procedures, specifically a fraudulent pickup of a wire transfer. This complaint specifically concerns Wells Fargo 's misinterpretation and mishandling of the situation. The availability date on the wire was XX/XX/XXXX. The confirmation page we received along with supporting documentation is attached. We informed Wells Fargo of the the fraudulent wire on XX/XX/XXXX. They attempted unsuccessfully to recall the funds. I believe under regulation e a fraudulent pick up is covered under the error procedures and Wells Fargo is required to refund the total funds. The following is the specific comment on regulation e that I am referring to. 33 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( iv ) Failure To Make Funds Available by Date of Availability Proposed 205.33 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( iv ) generally defined an error to include a remittance transfer providers failure to make funds in connection with a remittance transfer available to the designated recipient by the date of availability stated on the receipt or combined disclosure, subject to two specified exceptions, discussed below. The Board proposed comment 33 ( a ) -4 to provide examples of the circumstances that would have been considered errors under proposed 205.33 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( iv ). These circumstances included : ( i ) The late delivery of a remittance transfer after the stated date of availability or non- delivery of the transfer ; ( ii ) the deposit of a remittance transfer to the wrong account ; ( iii ) retention of the transferred funds by a recipient agent or institution after the stated date of availability, rather than making the funds available to the designated recipient ; and ( iv ) the fraudulent pick-up of a  remittance transfer in a foreign country by a person other than the person identified by the sender as the designated recipient of the transfer. Fraudulent pick-up, however, did not include circumstances in which a designated recipient picks up a remittance transfer from the providers agent as authorized, but subsequently the funds are stolen from the recipient. Several industry commenters objected to the inclusion of fraudulent pick-up as an error. These commenters suggested that the remittance transfer provider should not be responsible for fraud that results in the pick-up of a remittance transfer by a person other than the designated recipient where the provider is unlikely to know or have control over all the intermediary institutions involved in the transfer or the final institution that will make the funds available to the designated recipient. Other commenters, including the OCC, suggested that this error might result in friendly fraud where a sender claims the amount was not an authorized pick- up when the pick-up was actually legitimate. The OCC was also concerned that the exposure to remittance transfer providers for this error may be aggravated in situations involving large dollar remittances and because of the long period of time that a sender could assert this error. One industry commenter noted that while there may be certain instances when fraudulent pick-up should be considered an error, there may be other  circumstances when fraudulent pick-up should not be an error. In particular, this commenter suggested that where the name of the person picking up the funds does not match the name of the designated recipient set forth in the receipt, the sender should be able to assert an error. However, if an individual presents fake identification in the name of the designated recipient, this commenter stated that this fraudulent pick-up is outside of the remittance transfer providers control and therefore, should not be considered an error. Industry commenters also believed that a remittance transfer provider should not be liable for a fraudulent pick-up when a provider and its agent has complied with fraud and risk management policies and procedures. As the Board noted in the XX/XX/XXXX Proposed Rule, treating fraudulent pick- up of a remittance transfer as an error is consistent with the scope of unauthorized EFTs under 1005.2 ( m ), which includes unauthorized EFTs initiated through fraudulent means.See comment 2 ( m ) -3. Although identity theft can present a challenge to remittance transfer providers, financial institutions face similar challenges with respect to unauthorized EFTs and bear most of the risk. Moreover, similar to remittance transfers, the entity in the best position to verify the identity of the person initiating the EFT ( for example, the merchant at a store who initiates an EFT using a debit card ) may not be known or controlled by the financial institution, though such entities may have agreed to abide by system rules ( e.g., payment card network rules, ACH system rules ). However, under current laws governing EFTs, whether the financial institution knows or has control over that entity ( e.g., a merchant ) does not affect whether an EFT could be an unauthorized EFT. Similarly, the Bureau believes that whether a fraudulent pick-up should be considered an error should not be affected by the relationship between the remittance transfer provider and the entity distributing the remittance transfer to the designated recipient. Furthermore, the Bureau agrees with the Boards reasoning in the XX/XX/XXXX Proposed Rule that it is appropriate to treat these circumstances as errors because the remittance transfer provider, rather than the sender, is in the best position to ensure that a remittance transfer is picked up only by the person designated by the sender. For example, in some models, remittance transfer providers could require or contract with the entity distributing the funds, if it is not the remittance transfer provider itself, to request and examine identification from the person picking up the funds. The Bureau believes that including fraudulent pick-up as an error would better align the remittance transfer providers incentives to prevent this occurrence with the interests of the sender. I would like a refund of the amount remitted, as required in the error resolution procedures."
742,"On XX/XX/2022 a Wire Transfer from my Wells Fargo checking account was initiated to XXXX XXXX account. The transfer did not go through.

752,"I was involved in a XXXX scam in where a criminal posted a AD for concert tickets on XX/XX/XXXX going by the name of XXXX XXXX. The criminals phone number in the AD was : XXXX. To exercise caution I called the phone number on the AD and requested that the seller meet me in person to exchange the tickets for the funds. The seller said that there was no way they could meet due to not having an available vehicle and mentioned they could send e-tickets instantly to me if i could send payment ( {$200.00} ) through XXXX to pay for all three concert tickets that I wanted to purchase for a concert on XX/XX/XXXX. I was speaking with them on the phone about the transaction and they said if I could send 1/2 the payment for safety first they would send two of the tickets and i could send the rest of the payment and they would send the remaining ticket. I sent the money ( {$100.00} ) through XXXX ( via Wells Fargo bank ) live with them on the phone and when they received it they said they were going to send the tickets and then hung up on me. To give them the benefit of the doubt I thought the phone disconnected but when I called back over times times they never picked up. This is the book definition of digital theft/wire fraud and they perpetrator and in any nationwide justice system the criminal would do jail time if persecuted. I received a message from the scammer a day filled with curse words and they said they did not know what I was referring to. This is a case of complete wire fraud, criminal theft and unethical behavior in the utmost manner. 

I opened a fraud case with the Wells Fargo XXXX Banking department on XX/XX/XXXX and I just found out today ( after contacting wells fargo ) on XXXX that they absolutely refuse to pursue the matter and contact the bank in where the criminal received the money or give me absolutely anything back. 

Specifically, I spoke with a manager in the Wells Fargo XXXX Banking department about the matter and they were extremely rude and short with me and very rudely said that they can not do anything about this matter and I am on my own and that I should have been more smart not to send this money."
753,"Please note that I provide consent for the CFPB to publish this description, with the request that the CFPB remove or blank out my personal information ( name ), the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the name of the XXXX XXXX XXXX person XXXX XXXX.

I am the person was injured as a consequence of XXXX XXXX allowing the check to be cashed. 
Wells Fargo has done NOTHING and non-responsive despite multiple attempts by my XXXX XXXX and myself to contact them to resolve the matter. 
II. Here is a summary of the sequence of events : 1 ) I used XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank to send out two cashier checks, each for {$5000.00}, on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX respectively, payable to Hope Today c/o XXXX XXXX, at the address XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX.

III. Wells Fargo is either inefficient, incompetent, purposely stalling to cover up its negligence in allowing the checks with invalid endorsement to be cashed."

I then called Wells Fargo where the fraudulent account was, to stop acceptance of the payment, and they refused to speak to me since I do not have a Wells Fargo account. XXXX XXXX XXXX reviewed my claim and said I made the transfer, there's nothing they can do. I only used XXXX as it is on the XXXX XXXX XXXX website, so assumed ( wrongly apparently ) it was a safe manner to transfer the money.

So I decided to call XXXX XXXX XXXX and ask them to once again review my claim based on Wells Fargo 's reimbursement and they again refused to help me."
755,"I was attempting to buy concert tickets from a listing on XXXX. He suggested to use XXXX since it was involved with the the major banks of XXXX XXXX  XXXX, his bank, and Wells Fargo, my bank. He told me he would electronically transfer the tickets to my XXXX account upon receiving the XXXX XXXX, and I would get an email of the notification. No such email was rec 'd by me. He called me a few minutes later to tell me that the XXXX transfer did not go through because we haven't done it before with each other, and I needed to call the bank to confirm the transfer.This was my first time using XXXX. I called to file a fraud claim with Wells Fargo, they said the transfer had indeed been completed. I told Wells Fargo that they are facilitating fraud with other banks if there is no mechanism to unwind an unfulfilled, fraudulent transaction. It's simply wrong in this electronic age to allow banks to facilitate a fraudulent transfer of money, since two step verification with a security code can be installed to protect the sender and receiver in multiple steps of a transaction. 

The amount in question is {$200.00}."

As a result my refiner wired XXXX US dollars into that account.

Wells Fargo opened an account in my business without doing any due diligence, let a large sum of money to be wired into an account off shore with no due diligence. 

Wells Fargo was absolutely no help with any of my questions and told me the only way to get the XXXX back was to take them to court."
766,"I initiated the bank to bank transfer with Wells Fargo to transfer {$1800.00} from   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   to Wells Fargo on   XXXX    XXXX , 2017. On the morning (   XXXX   XXXX   ) of  XXXX   XXXX , 2017 I called to cancel the web transfer, and was told by a Wells Fargo customer representative told that the transaction would be cancelled.

In the meantime, the funds were not appearing in my Wells Fargo account or back in my   XXXX   XXXX   account. On  XXXX   XXXX , 2017 I received a fax confirming that funds were transferred to Wells Fargo. I then called Wells Fargo because the funds were still not showing in my account, and had to start another investigation. I was told it would take up to 10 days to research my claim. That amount of time is unacceptable, as I do not understand why they are unable to find my funds relating to this transfer."
770,"Approximately six weeks ago, we ( my wife and I ) became the victims of a group of individuals posing as agents of XXXX, XXXX who would help us secure our account which they claimed had been breached. We had been in contact with them by phone almost daily. During the ensuing weeks, they had withdrawn small amounts from our accounts which were reversed almost immediately. They told us that this activity was necessary to secure the accounts and to monitor them. 

On XX/XX/2022, I noted that there was an unauthorized wire transfer from our Wells Fargo joint checking account to XXXX XXXX XXXX  in the amount of {$4100.00} plus a {$30.00} fee. I contacted Wells Fargo Fraud Department informing them that the transfer was unauthorized by us. The wire transfer was posted on XXXX. We received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that because the wire transfer was made using our user id and password, Wells Fargo will not reimburse us. Note, I notified the fraud department prior to the wire transfer as per Well Fargo procedures regarding wire transfers. Furthermore, we were never notified that the wire transfer was completed. Their regulations are vague regarding how they were to notify us."
772,"On or about XX/XX/2019, I consented to the wire transfer of {$11000.00} of my retirement savings to what I believed was a XXXX XXXX account held through Wells Fargo. Since the time that wire was completed, I have been unable to access or fully trace those funds. I believe that I consented to an erroneous wire transfer into a Wells Fargo account that I did not intend. I have repeatedly requested, through various communications, that Wells Fargos assist me in tracing these funds, and recovering them from the unintended Wells Fargo account holder. 

On or about XX/XX/2019, I submitted paperwork to XXXX XXXX ( the custodian for my 401 ( k ) plan ) to accomplish a rollover to my XXXX XXXX IRA. Following some back and forth to complete the required paperwork, XXXX XXXX initiated a wire transfer of {$11000.00} on or about XX/XX/2019. I had instructed XXXX XXXX to wire the funds as follows : Wells Fargo Bank NA XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX Account No. : XXXX XXXX  No. : XXXX I contacted XXXX XXXX on or about XX/XX/2019 to follow up on the wired retirement funds. XXXX XXXX confirmed that Wells Fargo had received the wire, but that the money was in an account to which I ( and presumably XXXX XXXX ) did not have access. I then sought to initiate a service recall of the wired funds on XX/XX/2019 through XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo, in turn, required a debit authorization from me to allow the recall. When I later called Wells Fargo to provide such authorization, Wells Fargo refused to speak with me about the account since I was not the account holder. 

Since XXXX of 2019, I have sent a letter to Wells Fargo 's Board of Directors and have had a number of follow up phone calls resulting in Wells Fargo taking the position that they have contacted the account holder, into which the funds were transferred, and they have not received any response. Wells Fargo has indicated that they will take no further action, will not disclose the account holders name, or recover the funds that they know do not belong to their account holder, without further legal action. 

Wells Fargo was provided overwhelming evidence that my retirement funds were erroneously transferred into the wrong account. They have repeatedly indicated that they have reached out to this account holder and informed the account holder of the erroneously transferred. Wells Fargo has not received any response from their account holder to these requests. What is clear is that Wells Fargo 's account holder has stolen these funds and does not intend to return the money. I believe that Wells Fargo, by their inaction, is assisting their account holder in the theft on my retirement funds. I also believe that Wells Fargo has violated the law and the "" Know Your Customer '' regulations by failing to protect my money from theft by their account holder. Wells Fargo should have notified law enforcement and other agencies when it became clear that their account holder had stolen my retirement funds. The wire transfer, although containing the wrong account number, clearly indicated the funds were being transferred for me and the funds were to be placed in my XXXX XXXX account."
773,"XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX- my Wells Fargo business account was drained with 63 individual charges at XXXX  

transaction. There was nothing left, but an overdraft. I attempted to fix the issue- using the phone number referenced on the account. I was told I would be getting a refund due to a system glitch, and they wanted to see the charges from my bank statements.

I use XXXX transfers through my Wells Fargo account pretty regularly and this is the first time I have ever been scammed.

The seller claimed to only want to use there chase pay or XXXX account attached. I had no idea this could happen.

Three checks were dated XX/XX/XXXX, and deposited exactly 6 months later on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Because the deposit was through the atm, Wells Fargo treated it as deposited the next day, and charged a fee for deposited a stale dated check. ( {$36.00}, which was {$12.00} times three. ) The {$36.00} fees were assessed XX/XX/XXXX. 

Wells Fargo should refund the {$36.00} fee because it incorrectly told me I had 6 months to deposit the check in the ATM, which warning that it was really 6 months minus one day."

Wells Fargo sent a generic letter that they could not refund my {$210.00} dollars, even though I had proof of the scam from the XXXX convo, and the person on XXXX deactivated their account after they got my money!!! This is very disappointing that Wells Fargo will not help me, nor punish the scammers. I demand my money back!"
784,"I was involved in an online scam week and half ago involving XXXX I paid for the dog online using XXXX and a cash app. Didnt realize until after the transaction was made that this was a fraudulent transaction. I tried to resolve with my bank, Wells Fargo and they told me there was nothing that they could do, couldnt even pull up information regarding the transaction so I could make a police report and take legal action. My bank is supposed to protect any fraudulent transactions on my account And at this point there is they have told me theres nothing that they can do. I find this hard to believe. This was money I sent on my account and I am not entitled to any information regarding this? I feel like Im at a loss, and would love any help I could get. I have all the information from the breeder emails, copies of transactions, Or any other information you need."
785,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I am writing to you, as I was a victim of wire fraud during a real estate transaction recently, and I was unable to get information regarding my claim until an email was received today from Wells Fargo, with incorrect information and stating that I would not receive my money back. Prior to today, XX/XX/2022, every time I called I am transferred a minimum of 7 times, and everyone states that they can not help me and need to transfer me again. After an hour of this or more daily, I hang up. I also have had Wells Fargo employees telling me different things, and some who have stated that they can not find the claim. I have emailed the Board of Directors at Wells Fargo last week, and still not one of you has had the decency to contact me regarding this matter. Today, I spoke with XXXX XXXX. To follow up on the email I received and explained that I had wired the money on XX/XX/2022, and on XX/XX/2022, I reported that the title company that the money was sent to, just notified me that they didnt receive the money and report that the wire instruction email was intercepted by fraud.. XXXX stated that the records show that it was reported that I notified them on XX/XX/2022, and there was nothing else they could do to help me. That {$18000.00} was my entire savings and I am currently homeless, have no money and in a state that I recently relocated to. I have been in tears daily, explaining this over the phone or in person to Wells Fargo employees, and nobody will help me. I was initially told by your Wells Fargo that I would receive my money back in a maximum of 10 days, and that was on the day reported, XX/XX/2022. however, It has been much longer than that and I can not even receive an update. The FBI was notified after I was aware of the situation too. This is ridiculous and horrible customer service, and I need I am definitely going to remove the little bit of money I have in Wells Fargo and transfer to a better bank ; Wells Fargo has been incompetent and not following their own CODE OF ETHICS. Why would anyone want to have their money in your bank when this is what happens. Banks are supposed to protect customers and treat them with respect and as a human being and protect their money when things like this occur. I have spent so much time and energy on this issue and have not received any further information than was given to me the day that I reported the claim. This situation is extremely stressful, and Wells Fargo has just made it much worse than it needed to be and they are not assisting me with this situation. I would appreciate anything you could do to help me or guide me in the right direction, as I lost my entire savings. 

Thank you XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"
786,"On XX/XX/21, I had a cashiers check in the amount of {$220000.00} issued from funds in my Wells Fargo Bank account. I mailed the check to the payee via certified US mail. The post office lost the check and suggested I put a stop payment it. On XX/XX/21, I went to a Wells Fargo branch and put a stop payment on the check. When doing so, Wells Fargo informed me that I would have to pay a bond of 5 % of the value of the check if I wanted the funds returned to the account right away. Wells Fargo stated that absent payment of the bond, I would have to wait 90 days from issuance of the check to get the funds returned to my account, unless the check was eventually found, whereupon I could take the original check to a Wells Fargo branch and the funds would be returned to my account immediately. I did not pay the bond, hoping that the post office would soon find it and deliver it to the payee. Eventually, the post office found the check and the payee received it. The payee then wrote void across the check and mailed it to me, as, in the interim, I had paid the payee the funds she was due via wire transfer. Today, XX/XX/21, I presented the original cashiers check to Wells Fargo Bank and requested that the funds be redeposited to my account. Wells Fargo refused, stating that because the payee had written void across the check, the check was, for all intents and purposes, destroyed. Wells Fargo stated that the only options for redepositing these funds to my account are to wait the full 90 days from issuance or to have the payee complete an affidavit attesting that the check had never been in the payees possession and for me to pay the bond. Given that I presented the original cashiers check to Wells Fargo, I believe Wells Fargo is required to redeposit the funds to my account without further ado, and that it is unlawful for Wells Fargo to continue holding onto my funds any longer."

I went to my bank to get my money on XX/XX/2020, when I didn't receive what I had paid for and did not receive my money back. They looked into it and even though the guy who scammed me was clearly impersonating another person ( Wells Fargo said their accounts didn't match up ) they would not consider it fraudulent. I Lost XXXX dollars in this exchange. Attached is my fake lease and emails that I though were going to lead to my new home. I need that money. I don't know who else to go to."

A couple of days later he texts my phone saying they are going to back out from the deal and wont pick up the table and chairs I had listed on XXXX. And wanted me to XXXX him XXXX $ from my account to his zelle email he provided. Fast forward to today XX/XX/21 Wells Fargo had not only overdrawn my account by XXXX $ but theyve have also decided to return the check today instead of actually holding it when it was deposited on XX/XX/21. Now Im negative in my account have no money to help pay for things my child needs.

But of course, it was a scam and it worked unfortunately. The transaction took place on XX/XX/21. Im really hoping I could get these funds back because losing half a grand isnt fun."

Two days later, with no reason given, I was texted the words that the contract was null and void, and the money was going to be demanded back. Shortly after, I received a message from XXXX that I owe them {$1000.00} and a {$15.00} dollar fee. I contacted XXXX, they provided the information that the payment was made through a charge card with Wells Fargo bank. I disputed the charge-back, providing objective evidence of the non-refundable nature of the deposit. I tried to resolve this with XXXX, they said it is an external issue with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo says it is an issue with XXXX. Neither has any interest in resolving this. In the meantime, XXXX has threatened to send the information to a collection company.

The transactions were attempted through XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX {$300.00}, the XXXX {$1000.00}, the XXXX {$1000.00}, XXXX {$1000.00} and the XXXX {$500.00}.

By XX/XX/2019 I still had not received any merchandise from them even though I was told it was 5 to 10 processing days plus 2 day shipping. Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I have reached out to the company over and over again to try and see if my merchandise was on its way if I were going to be receiving merchandise or if I was just going to get a refund. The company and I finally decided that I would receive a refund between 7 to 10 business days and I still have not received anything from them to this day! I reached out to my bank Wells Fargo to see how they could help me with this transaction since I sent my money through XXXX through Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo told me that there was nothing they could do to help me because they see it like a cash transaction even though there's proof that I sent the amount of {$280.00} to the company. I reached out to Wells Fargo once again to see if they could help me with this transaction and I have an open claim with them now for the second time! I really feel like that I'm not getting any kind of help with any of this so I'm coming to you to see what we can do to resolve this.
812,"On XX/XX/XXXX at about XXXX XXXX, I received an email from Wells Fargo stating that there was something suspicious on my account. I denied the transaction that they were questioning. I also turned off my card at the time via the Wells Fargo app. When I woke up the next morning there was another phishing transaction that was reversed. There were also three XXXX XXXX transactions amounting {$7300.00}. I immediately called Wells Fargo, they turned off the card that I already turned off and started an investigation. I filed a police report with my local department on or about XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received two letters stating that they were denying any liability and would not be returning my funds to me and were considering the cases closed. On XX/XX/XXXX I spent about 4 hours on the phone with countless people at Wells Fargo, not a single person can tell me why this is denied. I asked that they please send me the investigation paperwork, the first person I spoke with said they couldnt do that even though the paperwork specifically said that they would send all of that if I requested it. I then called XXXX XXXX. They said they turned off the profile that was used to send the money but they arent willing to do anything further. I am not sure why all of these people expect me to forget that {$7300.00} was taken from me and no one seems to care. My family NEEDS this money. It is Wells Fargos responsibility to fix this for me. I dont know why I am trying to complete my own investigation. I dont have the tools to do so, the bank does."
815,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a text message stating "" Wells Fargo Fraud '' asking if I had authorized a {$2000.00} transaction, and if not, reply "" NO '' I replied no and almost immediately my phone rang. The person identified himself, asked again if I had verified this transaction and an additional transaction for {$1500.00}. I stated I did not. He asked if anyone else had access to my bank account, to which I replied my husband does but I know he did not authorize this. He asked if my husband  was in XXXX, Georgia where he claimed this transaction originated. The previous week my XXXX account had been used for a purchase in Indiana, and I had requested a new Wells Fargo debit card in case my number had been obtained. This man then proceeded to tell me I could recover my funds immediately if I used XXXX to send them to myself. I did ask if I could call back at a better time as I was at a playdate with my kid, and he said that if I wanted to have the funds immediately available instead of the 3-6 weeks it would take normally, I had to deal with the issue immediately. He proceeded to walk me through the steps of adding myself as a new XXXX recipient on my XXXX account. I input my own name and phone number, so I thought surely I can't be sending money to anyone else as this is my information. XXXX then texted me a code which he asked for, and unfortunately I gave him. He had me send the money in 3 transactions, the first for {$1000.00} each and the final for the amount that remained in my account, which he was able to see as XXXX. He then instructed me to make sure I changed my password on my Wells Fargo account and we hung up. I finished up the playdate quickly and headed to a local branch of the bank. The man who had I had spoken with did call back and asked if I had changed my account password, to which I stated I had and we hung up again. There at my local bank I spoke with a banker who informed me that this was a scam and directed me to call the help center for fraud. I filed my complaint with the WellsFargo fraud center, and they said they would investigate and inform me of the outcome at the end of 10 business days. They did ask if I had any accounts at XXXX XXXX  to which I did not, but they encouraged me to call them to ensure that no one had fraudulently opened an account in my name. I called XXXX and this had not happened. I called Wells Fargo back after approximately 6 business days and the agent said he could not update me, that the claim was being worked and I needed to give them more time. After the end of the 10 business days, I received a letter ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) in the mail stating they had researched my complaint, but since I authorized the XXXX transactions, they would not be refunding the money. Wells Fargo said that "" as a courtesy '' they had reached out to the receiving financial institution ( XXXXXXXX XXXX  ) to see if they could recover the funds. I called upon receiving this letter to complain about the handling of the case, they stated they would escalate it and someone would call me back in 3 business days. No one ever called. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX to speak to someone. This time an agent named XXXX did at least explain the process more in detail so I could know how the investigation was done, but she stated that XXXX had also been unable to recover the funds and had closed the case. I asked to again escalate my case as there should be better handling and consumer protection. The manager over XXXX called, and offered no additional help. I also received an email on XXXX XXXX from the escalations department stating they were looking into the case, but no phone call from that department. I received an additional email XX/XX/XXXX from the escalations department stating the case had been handled appropriately, listed the XXXX customer service number and stated there would be no further action on their part. When I called that number a recording states that if you are using XXXX through your online bank they do not have access to your account and to hang up and call your bank. At this point, it seems I have exhausted my options with XXXXWells Fargo to recover the money."
816,My cash app not receiving balance on time as needed
818,"On XX/XX/XXXX I wanted to buy a nice meal for my family on XXXX  and contact this lady and she insists on using XXXX to pay her {$180.00} and said I am in front of the post office and will send you the tracking number for the shipment right away. I was hesitant but noticed it was available through WELLS FARGO WEBSITE, so I figured it must be a trusted app and that WELLS FARGO BANK would stand behind anything that is available right there in their WEBSITE! Right after I sent my payment, the seller stopped responding to me and would not answer any phone calls or texts, and the thanksgiving food as promised. 
I called well Fargo to stop the payment and refund me the money. they said we can not help you. As of the time of posting, WELLS FARGO BANK has not helped me get my money back. 
As I am reading now these are not isolated incidents. The banks are doing nothing to help victims of XXXX scams and seem to have no legal obligation to do so. Instead, theyre saying because the buyer authorized the transaction, theres nothing they can do to help recoup the stolen money. 
Scammers know people arent aware of this because XXXX is brand-new. They also know that people will choose to trust XXXX because its backed by their bank and because its a feature within their banks own website."
819,"I received a Wells Fargo Bank Transfer statement in the mail. I called Wells Fargo and told them we had cancelled my application in XXXX 2020. I spoke to my bank credit card department and was told that the {$56.00} purchases and adjustments they charged me would be cancelled and there would be no balance transfer. I received a bank statement from XXXX XXXX  that Wells Fargo did a balance transfer. The amount was never discussed and I had not approved of this transter. I called Wells Fargo and was told there was nothing they could do, today, XXXX XXXX, 2020. 
I do not want Wells Cargo balance transfer. I told Wells Fargo unless I can get the entire amount {$2500.00} paid in a balance transfer, I would not agree to their transfer."
820,"On XX/XX/22, I received a text from Wells Fargo stating there was a zelle transfer for {$3500.00} trying to process and we it me. I sent the no response and shortly received a phone call from Wells Fargo. The caller ID said Wells Fargo and the phone number was the one of the back of my debit card. So when I answered the 'representative ' told me about this transfer trying to complete from Idaho was it me. I denied the transfer and he said they were going to do a zelle transfer of all of my current funds to myself. So my account would look like it was empty. He explained this would put a block on my acct for XXXX hours so no other transfers would occur. On XX/XX/22 I checked my account and still no money but I had previously scheduled debits out so of course an overdrawn account. I called Wells Fargo and they said it's a scam and they filed the claim. I was told to call back XXXX business days later for the result and here we are XXXX business days later, and Wells Fargo is starting it was an authorized transfer and no need to give me my money back. The bank acknowledged these scams are going on, they conveniently sent out about email to customers about XXXX days after this incident happened to me to warn customers but failed to say it is not their problem."
821,"I was making a transaction with a seller and he told me to pay through XXXX since it was the most convenient option. I went through with this payment method since my bank provided it, only to be scammed out of my money, which was more than XXXX . I have tried contacting the seller but have received no word. I looked to see how this issue is fixed but have seen in forums that my bank provider, Wells Fargo, does not honor protecting people through XXXX. I need to get my money back because I have payments coming up. I need help ASAP"
823,"On XX/XX/2021 Tuesday at XXXX am, I had a gentleman by the name of XXXX ID # XXXX call me on my cell and said he was calling from Wells Fargo Fraud ( the number that he was calling from, I looked it up online as I was talking to him and that day it was a legit Wells Fargo Number ) and had asked if I made 2 purchases. One in the amount of {$1000.00} and the other in the amount of {$2500.00} I said no and he said that we need to XXXX my money back to me. So he sent me a code to put it in XXXX, typed my name as the recipient, but it actually went to him at XXXX XXXX. As I hung up I knew I fell for Fraud so I immediately called Wells Fargo, they put a claim in and said I had to wait 10 days to see if I get my money back ( Which the transaction was pending that day in my account and when I looked the next day, Wells Fargo had put it through ) So when I called on the 10th day Wells Fargo had told me my claim has been closed because there is nothing they can do and it is what it is. Well I do not beleive it is what it is. I have all documentation showing that I had called them, reported fraud, also Wells Fargo stating that if I didn't send this money or if it is fraud to please call them and I did within 2 minutes of it happening. I have emailed XXXX, FBI, talked to Wells Fargo and contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I think they should refund my money."

I was still on the clock at work so I was stressing over not having time to deal with this. I hurried and called XXXX number provided in e-mail. I told them I made no such purchases please stop payment. He said ok I will do best to help you. He said sign on to my bank ( Wells Fargo ) account that is connected to my XXXX account first to see if charge has been taken. I was rushed and didnt suspect anything because he knew a lot personal information. When I logged on I was relieved the funds hadnt been taken yet. He then instructed me to open an application so he could possibly stop transaction. This app. provided him control of my screen I guess. He then transferred funds {$830.00} from XXXX app. he said it would be returned. I was confused but he gave me his extension so I could call him as soon as funds were returned. I did what he said because I had to finish working. I called him back because the funds werent return yet. I checked my XXXX credit account and saw {$460.00} had been charged. I called him back and asked he answered so I was suspicious but thought he wouldnt be answering his calls if it was a scam. I asked him is this a scam he said most definitely not. Then asked if I had any other credit cards. He told me to hold. While on hold I hung up and called Wells Fargo to tell them I think Ive just been scammed and to please stop payment on the fraud payment of {$830.00}. They said they will transfer to someone that can help me. I told the next person the situation they said they can not stop payment and transfer me to someone else. I am fully stressed and crying. The next person said they will note it and be in contact. I said shouldnt we close the card in case they can still get more funds? They said we can do that if you want? I said absolutely because the work paycheck was going to be deposited on XX/XX/XXXX. They said dont worry the fraud dept. will contact me for for details of claim. They never called. I called because I didnt want to answer calls I didnt know in case of more scams. They said we understand and my claim is under investigation they will notify me by mail. I said no one ever called to get the details of scam. They said not to worry your funds will most likely be refunded and to watch for that and wait for letter by mail. I received a letter XX/XX/2022 saying it is still under investigation and they will keep me updated. I called again and again and finally someone told me case closed. They said a letter was sent. No letter was sent of notification of that. I said I want to make complaint she said I will put a concern on my account and someone will contact me within XXXX hrs. No one called! I called back they put me on hold, after XXXX minutes on hold the phone disconnected. I called back and was on hold waiting in line again. Then I had to tell the whole story again. Then transfer again. Then they said oh I need to get you to the online fraud dept. I had to tell them what I was calling about. I gave them the claim number. They said we are so sorry for your frustration but the funds will most likely show up in your account. They have notified XXXX of the fraud and Wells Fargo has done there part and when XXXX completes their investigation and return the funds we will return them to your account. I complain to XXXX. It is now XX/XX/2022. 
The only thing that has been done is a new warning posted of Wells Fargo about XXXX connected scams and beware. No Help. 
Thank you, XXXX XXXX"

826,"I have a checking account with wells Fargo. Due to my XXXX being stolen, several XXXX  transactions went thru for the amount {$580.00}. I disputed the transactions on July 3rd. Due to other fraudulent activity i was told to file a separate claim for the XXXX  transactions which i did on july 19 and was given the provisional credit. On july 21st i got a letter stating that the investigation was completed and that the provisional credit will be reversed since they say the XXXX transactions where approved by me, which is untrue. The claim # i have with wells fargo is # XXXX. I did not make the transactions it was just by a push of a button on my stolen XXXX and if wells fargo honored the other fraudulent transactions totaling {$9700.00} ( claim # XXXX ) they should honor this as well."
827,"Location XXXX, PA On Monday XX/XX/, {$120000.00} was deposited into our Wells Fargo Bank by my lawyer which was part of a settlement from a well known insurance company. This was a week ago today. The money is still not available for withdrawal ( which we didnt know this until we had overdrawn our checking account and couldnt get anythiing to go through ). We have talked with the XXXX XXXX  ( title is banker II ) on Friday and we can't get this money made available even 5 days after deposit. XXXX is the other bank that is the sender of the money to XXXX 

I am XXXX and live on a very small amount of money and need this money to help pay some bills. Can your organization help? I feel like XXXX is using my money for however long they want to do their own business.. 

In talking with XXXX we have not discovered any reason for them to suspect they will not get the money from XXXX or havent already. We are not habitual overdrafters on our account. Aren't there limits to how long banks can hold people 's money when they want it. WF released {$4800.00} on day 2 after the deposit and say the  remaining amount won't be available until XX/XX/XXXX!! This seems excessive The banker is XXXX XXXX at XXXX we can be reached at XXXX or XXXX or XXXX or my cell XXXX."

831,"Wells Fargo employees stole my ID and applied for loans in my name from the SBA and open accounts at their facility. I was forced to freeze my account and cards. Wells Fargo refused to contact the credit bureau to remove the inquiry from my report.

This has prevented me from using my accounts to buy gas or opening any other credit"
833,Recently I was scammed for buddy pass tickets for XXXX XXXX. The scammer had me use XXXX through Wells Fargo which I believed to be secure but indeed is not. The bank incorporates XXXX in their mobile app and make it seem like it's a transfer feature between people with the same bank. They make it seem secure and trackable. The bank does.not care that this is happening nor are they cooperating. I did a lot of research on the identity that the scammer used. I eventually got in touch with the real person who's identity the scammer was using. He claims it's a huge on going investigation and he gave me contact info for a Detective XXXX XXXX. The banks should not be backing XXXX. It is misleading by having it incorporated in their mobile app and they seem not to care whether I told them I was scammed. They should reverse the payment and also provide the receiving account details to the Detective.

Wells Fargo also charged me a {$30.00} wire transfer fee. The wire transfer was never received by the recipient bank. Wells Fargo has not contacted me at all to say if there was a problem or if they needed more information. Wells Fargo is just holding my funds. I have spent many hours on the phone with customer service, online customer service, online claims, the wire transfer department, customer advocacy and even went into a bank branch. I have sent several emails to various departments that I thought might be able to help. I have been informed that Wells Fargo is holding my money but none have been able to resolve this problem or have the funds either sent to the intended recipient or returned to my account."

The money was transferred from XXXX   XXXX XXXX to Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo alertly caught the exact dollar amount and froze the account that the money was put into. The problem is, is that Wells Fargo is not releasing the money to me, nor are they being communicative with the XXXX XXXX people.

One person contacted me on XXXX and asked me to send text to her husband 's mobile number about one of the items i had put on sale. The person wanted to buy this furniture item from me and agreed to buy all items I had put on in app for selling. He sent me Cashier 's check which included amount for furniture items I had put for sale and charges to be paid to Mover for movement of these furniture items. He asked me to deposit this check and once the amount is deposited to my account, make {$1500.00} payments to Mover with email ID through XXXX app. I insisted that I dont want to make any payments and hold his money as my move out plan was postponed due to travel restrictions. He asked me to make Mover 's payment and agreed to pickup furniture items once my travel plan is finalized. I deposited the cashier check and waited for it to be processed and next day it was processed and amount was available in my account.

I called Bank representative where my account is, but they said they can not help and I asked them to cancel XXXX transactions so that I can get my money back but they said since I initiated these transactions, they cant help.

Then today, XX/XX/XXXX, I call again and they tell me that they can't do anything because Wells Fargo has the money. I call Wells Fargo and it says I have to call XXXX  XXXX XXXX. So who has my money? Neither of the two banks solve my problem.

I was then asked to wire the money to the broker representing the buyers. I set up a wire transfer through Wells Fargo and it immediately came back with a flag requesting I contact XX/XX/XXXX and validate the identity of the broker 's name I was to wire the money to. Bottom line Wells Fargo did not send the wire. I was advised my {$2200.00} was seized and would be sent to the Department of the Treasury. I was dealing with the death of my son during this time and put this matter on hold until I was able to get my head clear enough to go after whom ever I need to get my money back.

I received a notice from Wells Fargo that the transaction took place along with a phone number to call Wells Fargo if there were any questions. I called Wells immediately ( within 5 minutes after the transfer ) and they said there was nothing they could do to help with this fraud. 

On Wells Fargo 's website it says Online Security Guarantee covers XXXX transactions when initiated from Wells Fargo Online or Mobile. This is NOT BEING HONORED. 

My teenage daughter worked very hard for that money PLEASE HELP her get her money back."
850,"I went on XXXX to purchase an item. The item was listed for {$2.00}, but in the description of the item the seller said they only accept payments from XXXX or XXXX. I have a Wells Fargo checking and savings account and I used XXXX from the Wells Fargo app. The seller wanted {$550.00} for the item and they sent me messages through eBay I have all of the messages on my XXXX account.

What I thought was concert tickets being purchased turned out to be scam. Because I was directed to pay through XXXX, which I thought was a secure, traceable means of payment, I felt confident this wasn't a scam. Even if it was, there has to be a way for my Bank to track down/stop payment from going through, right? Wrong! 

After getting suspicious after a short amount of time ( 20 minutes ) after I completed the transaction, I immediately called Wells Fargo to put a stop to the transaction. After being put on hold for hours, speaking with multiple representatives, being transferred multiply times, being disconnected when being transferred, and being told there was nothing they could do, I felt helpless. The many Wells Fargo associated didn't seem to have an answer or they either said they could do something and then never did. 

I should have listened to my gut, but the fact that this was THROUGH a service provided by MY BANK, I felt reassured and confident this wasn't possible to do from a scammer end considering a bank account needed to be attached to the name/account I was transferring money to. 

Thank you for your service and thank you in advance for reading this."

856,"On XX/XX/2020, I sent money with the service XXXX, through the use of the Wells Fargo application. I had contacted a XXXX user who would sell me a phone for {$250.00}. She asked me to pay through XXXX, which I was not very accustomed to. I thought it would be a safe way of completing the purchase since the service, XXXX, was backed by the bank. This led me to think that the transaction would be completed safely. Upon sending the money, the user blocked my account so that I would no longer be able to contact her. After realizing what had happened, I contacted Wells Fargo that same day in order to learn about what I could do under these circumstances. I spoke with a representative that helped me dispute a transaction ; she informed me that I would be contacted with more information about my dispute. I was never contacted and have been waiting for further assistance to understand what I could do to receive the money I lost. I also contacted XXXX which was able to successfully remove the user from the service on XX/XX/2020. I attempted to contact XXXX but I never heard back from them.

Several months later i'd noticed the funds were not on my IRA Account and called Wells Fargo again to let them know what happened.

When i called the bank for my IRA account i was to to request evidence from Wells Fargo showing the Date, Amount, Bank Account, and Routing # to do an investigation. I called Wells Fargo again to request the evidence and a call back from a supervisor.

They asked my credit score and had I been evicted. Then stated if I was really serious and sent them XXXX they would take the house off the market. He told me to do a XXXX  transfer. I thought because I was doing it through my bank I would be safe guarded. I was only able to get XXXX thank goodness. I tried to stop the processing but it was too late.

864,"On XX/XX/XXXX my Wells Fargo Bank checking accounts were hacked. An unauthorized/fraudulent online transfer was made in the amount of {$20000.00} from one of my checking accounts to the other resulting in a loss of {$19000.00}. I was sitting at the desk of Wells Fargo personal banker, XXXX XXXX, at the XXXX XXXX, CA branch when he informed me that an online transfer was made that day. I immediately told him that I made NO ONLINE transfers that day, yet he failed to correct or reverse the transaction. I told him within minutes of it happening that I made NO ONLINE transfers that day. I also received an alert on my XXXX when I returned home notifying me of the {$20000.00} online transfer. The notice said, "" If you do not recognize this transaction or need assistance, you can reach us at XXXX, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week or by secure mail ''. I immediately returned to the bank, which is about 3 minutes away, and again told the bank teller that I DID NOT make any online transfers that day and that it was an unauthorized and fraudulent. All this happened within an hour on XX/XX/XXXX. I sent a letter to Wells Fargo Bank Manager, XXXX XXXX, requesting that the funds be returned and received no response. I sent an email to Wells Fargo 's XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX requesting that the funds be returned but received no response. I met with XXXX XXXX, Wells Fargo Regional Bank District Manager on XX/XX/XXXX about this matter and the matter of the wire transfer funded by the unauthorized/fraudulent transfer resulting in the loss of {$19000.00}. The wire transfer was investigated under a related complaint to CFPB reference # XXXX. Wells Fargo 's response to that complaint only addressed the failed attempt at the wire recall but no mention was made of personal banker, XXXX XXXX 's, failing to protect my funds by reversing the transaction after my telling him of the unauthorized transfer within minutes of the transaction occurring and before the wire was initiated. The part that was not properly investigated was the original unauthorized/fraudulent online transfer. In all my efforts to discuss the unauthorized/fraudulent transfer, which was what funded the wire transfer ; an open, transparent discussion and investigation did not take place which would have included personal Banker, XXXX XXXX, who should be held responsible for not reversing the transaction immediately. In my discussions with XXXX the Assistant Branch Manager, XXXX XXXX the Branch Manager, and XXXX XXXX the Regional Banking District Manager, they never included XXXX XXXX in the meeting to confirm his lack of action to protect my funds. I told them what he did and did not do but they brushed it off and focused only on the wire transfer and warned me about the pitfalls of wire transfers. 
I properly and promptly notified Wells Fargo verbally with in minutes, in writing and email within 10 days of the unauthorized/fraudulent online transfer per my Customer Account Agreement requirements but nothing was done. The first thing I asked XXXX was were their sufficient funds in the checking account being used for the wire transfer. He confirmed there was. I asked did those funds come from outside the bank? He replied that an online transfer was made that day to this account. I immediately told him that I made NO ONLINE transfers that day. He did not pursue my response or reverse the obvious unauthorized/fraudulent transfer. He went to talk to XXXX, the assistant bank manager, then returned to say the funds were available for the wire. I assumed that he realized that he was mistaken, and the funds did come from outside the bank. As a precaution and confirmation that the funds in this checking account did not come from my other larger balance checking account, I stated to XXXX that I wanted to make sure no funds being wired came from the larger balance checking account. XXXX could see on his monitor that the funds in this account did come from the larger balance account, but he did nothing about clearing up an obvious serious matter of a {$20000.00} unauthorized transfer and he didn't immediately reverse it but proceeded to wire those funds out."
865,"On XX/XX/2023, I cashed a check drawn from Wells Fargo bank at Wells Fargo bank branch XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX. I was told that I would be charged {$7.00} to cash the check. I argued that the check was drawn on Wells Fargo. The clerk refused to cash the check unless the {$7.00} was paid. The clerk informed me that they passed the cost to the consumer because the company that prints the checks would not pay a fee for processing the check. I had to cash it because Im from out of town and dont want to use check cashing companies. I feel that there should not be any fee for cashing a Wells Fargo check in a Wells Fargo bank. XXXX, Florida is where this branch is located."
868,I went to the atm to withdraw the money it told me i exceeded my daily limit. That was impossible because I havent even token cash out of this account that day.i tried to withdraw XXXX dollars today from the atm and I couldnt. But I magically got charged the money and Wells Fargo will not refund my money. I even got a paper from the business saying the transaction failed on there end. Wells Fargo is a bunch of crooks.

On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo alleges that the loan was paid off. On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo suddenly dismisses the lawsuit which is the second foreclosure lawsuit Wells Fargo has dismissed on the home since XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX A payoff statement was ordered from alleged to be XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Wells Fargo sends a letter to me in XX/XX/XXXX stating congratulations the loan was paid off with a release of mortgage. Wells Fargo has never disclosed how the loan was paid off or why the Foreclosure was dismissed. I had an attorney at the time XXXX XXXX who I was paying a monthly bill to help me save my home. I thought all the loans on the home were paid off after my wife passed away on XX/XX/XXXX through the probate of a wrongful XXXX. However, a XXXX Home Equity line of Credit was taken out in XX/XX/XXXX. My Last payment was in XXXX with the real mortgage company XXXX before they closed. Out of no where a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX alleges to have received assignment from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX which is about 6 years after my last payment. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX was calling me asking me to send documents regarding a previous loan with XXXX which I did not understand why. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX filed a foreclosure on the home without my knowledge or being served in any lawsuit. Wells Fargo filed a foreclosure XX/XX/XXXX. When I found about it the foreclosure with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX it was XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX stated to have no record of the home or involvement with XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. It appears that XXXX XXXX XXXX using the name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  as a decoy to hide XXXX XXXX  XXXX from any involvement or liability with the foreclosure lawsuit. In the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, I also discovered that documents were forged in my name as if I made appearances in court when I was working at the VA at the time. Then I hired an attorney on XX/XX/XXXX after that and not sure what happened next until now. Wells Fargo XXXX to have sold the loan in XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Wells Fargo claims it was paid off on XX/XX/XXXX it can not be both. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is alleging that it paid off the loan from Wells Fargo. When it was alleged to already been sold off. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX instead alleged to have consolidated the loan to avoid Wells Fargo foreclosure on the home that would have wiped any second liens on the title. I dont believe any loan was actually paid off to Wells Fargo XXXX Wells Fargo or XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is refusing to produce any payment information or wire transfer as to who, when, why or where this alleged payment was made. Now XXXX XXXX XXXX is claiming that it alleged to have paid off the loan, and added Wells Fargo loan to the old XXXX loan. I never knew anything about this at all. I have never signed anything or applied for any, new loans, refinance, loan modifications, Deed, in lieu, forbearance or reverse mortgage, confirming consolidating anything with XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Nor have I applied for loans above with any other lenders regarding the home. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX claims to have been paying extra home insurance on the home, Taxes, Wells Fargo transferred loan adding taxes to this amount. The amount Im alleged to owe with Bank XXXX XXXX is over XXXX on a home that is under water and worth less than XXXX. This is fraud, because I did not do any of this. Im being harassed by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX for money that I do not rightfully owe. I also recently discovered that Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX removed my name on the loan documents, and placed my former attorneys name to receive my loan billing statements. In the end my attorney claims to not know anything. Then later my former Attorney stated that he thinks XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX paid it off. I was never informed by my former attorneys that anything was paid off for me to have to pay it later with another lender, or servicer. Wells Fargo had me sign a loan Modification that originated by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX loan that I had on the home in XXXX. The loan was alleged to be acquired by Wells Fargo in XXXX. However, this can not be confirmed. Because Investors Saving Bank Received Government Assistance Failed on XX/XX/XXXX. The loan was created in XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX secured loan. In XXXX Wells Fargo pressured me to sign a loan Modification changing those terms of the original loan from a XXXX loan to a regular Mortgage without informing me of that. Wells, Fargo also did not get any approval from the XXXX to change the terms of the loan which was higher well above my income amount. Which now have me in the situation XXXX in today. Then soon after the loan Modification was completed a Bank called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX filed a foreclosure less than XXXX days later after alleged to have signed a subornation agreement with Wells Fargo. Now Im in a process to be evicted from my home by alleged to be XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. I believe its XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX using the name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  to Evict me from my home. XXXX XXXX XXXX also allege that I owe over XXXX to them that I know nothing about as well. I feel I have been a victim of Elder financial abuse, consumer fraud and fair debt collections act practices and mortgage foreclosure scam by hired law firm. It does appear that XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo were working together as this is connected with the National Mortgage Settlement ( XXXX ). Wells Fargo filed the first foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Illinois XXXX XXXX. I was also informed that the alleged judgment by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is invalid. The Eviction case on the home is XXXX. However, the eviction case was dismissed in XX/XX/XXXX. Whomever is working with alleged XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is still trying to pursue the Eviction case despite being dismissed for want to prosecute on XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX case was not refiled within one year  or vacated. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is Threatened to sue me for debt not owed. I also have reason to believe that additional lawsuits have been filed against me By XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX that Im not aware of. Nor was I served by anyone regarding any new lawsuits. Seeking assistance with this matter. Wells Fargo filed a foreclosure XX/XX/XXXX. I hired an attorney in XX/XX/XXXX after that and not sure what happened next until now. Wells Fargo XXXX to have sold the loan in XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX  XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo claims it was paid off on XX/XX/XXXX it can not be both. Docket one- This XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX says that I made payments when I have not made any of these payments to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I feel that someone took out a loan in my name and identity with XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX for me to pay it back later which is fraud. Im also a victim of identity as well since XXXX. XXXX XXXX This a document that was Submitted to the XXXX with false claims that the home was vacant. When the home was not Vacant to have me restricted from accessing the home and my property removed from the home. Despite a wrongfully filed Eviction case against the home during the Illinois Eviction moratorium in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Who is really XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX? XXXX XXXX has been XXXX  us at the home and her husband for years. I have proof that she has been disparaging us with random people while claiming to be the realtor of the bank. Then she seems to not be sure what bank she is alleged to be working with. But have uploaded old outdated documents from XXXX  XXXX XXXX. The XXXX document has XXXX  XXXX XXXX on it as well. 

This is wire transfer fraud scam that wired money to my former attorney for a settlement that I did not receive any money from. This is not about the false statements by Wells Fargo claiming the loan was paid off. The loan was forgiven for wrongdoing by Wells Fargo. Well 's Fargo is working with XXXX  XXXX XXXX as well. The amount that was alleged to be paid to well 's Fargo from XXXX  XXXX XXXX are totally different payment amounts.

882,"On XX/XX/XXXX I deposited a check of XXXX by a gentleman who owed me about XXXX as part of a consent order. 
The check was dated XX/XX/XXXX. 
The gentleman issued the check from his account at Wells Fargo Bank in Georgia and I was informed that when my check was cashed there was enough money in the gentlemen 's account. 
My bank, XXXXXXXX XXXX in Arizona did not accept the deposit and when I called XXXXXXXX XXXX  I was informed by the customer service that I had to deposit the check at the teller of my XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX since the check was older than 30 days. I did that on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Apparently the gentleman who wrote the check had by that time overdrawn his account at Wells Fargo and on XX/XX/XXXX I was informed that the check was returned. 
I was upset because of three things. 
1. Non payment of a legal obligation.

2. The fact that XXXX customer service informed me in one call that a check that is older than 30 days had to be presented in person ( I could not find that in any agreement ) 3. The fact that XXXX customer service in a later telephone call inform me that a check gets stale after 3 month ( my understanding from XXXX documentation is that it is 6 months ). 
4. That XXXX charges me XXXX for a uncovered check. 
When XXXX had just processed my deposited check I would not have been out of the XXXX and would not have to pay the XXXX 
I would appreciate if you could tell me if my understanding is correct. I am sure that neither Wells Fargo ( who is known for not always proper behavior ) neither XXXX will give me the full story."
884,"Hello! 

There was a fraud on my debit card 3 times on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, {$700.00} each time, which equals up to {$2100.00} in money that was stolen from me and that I haven't received back. I made a claim with my bank ( Wells Fargo ) and they denied it. They stated and sent documentation on why they denied me and they stated : The transactions were made using your card and Personal Identification Number ( PIN ), we found to was made by you or someone who had your permission, please consider your claim closed '' I have never lost my card, never my phone, never given anyone any bank information, so I don't understand how that's possible. I've just filed a police report as well in order to prove that I'm the real victim who's a XXXX XXXX  and desperately need my money back."
887,"I have been blacklisted on XXXX, a cryptocurrency exchange, for trying to use my debit card to make a purchase. Wells Fargo, for whatever reason, flagged my activity on the site as fraudulent behavior and rejected my purchase. Now my card is blacklisted on the site. This would not be as big of an issue if XXXX was n't one of the only legal US cryptocurrency exchanges. XXXX is doing their job and keeping their customers best interests in mind to protect them from scammers. Wells Fargo is acting outside of their domain and interfering with legal personal activities in which they do not have the right or jurisdiction to do so."
890,I received a call from Wells Fargo suspecting fraud and I confirmed but Wells Fargo transferred the funds to an unknown company and refused to talk to my bank XXXX or to me.
891,"I was supposed to receive a transfer from a friend for {$160.00}. Normally the transfer would be instant ( as my friend also uses the same bank - Wells Fargo ), however, the money did not arrive. I called a representative, who assured me that the money would be transferred within today - XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have not received the money, the transfer does not appear on my end ( it does appear FOR my friend the sender, confirmation code will be available if needed ).

How can your complaint be satisfactorily addressed?"

Multiple calls have been made to XXXX and Wells Fargo and investigations go no where. I also filled an investigation with my bank confirming transaction was never received. These transactions, equaling {$400.00} have yet to be resolved and no monies have been received by myself nor my sister."
893,I sent my account number to my account for direct deposit and my bank was on hold putting the money in the bank and made a payment of my stimulus check to a direct deposit loan on my brothers account and sent my money to some account was holding my bank on payment for a ticket I had and sent my money to a lawyer about a claim settlement while I had a XXXX  XXXX  agreement with my lawyer  and put me in a whole.

I contacted my bank Wells Fargo as soon as I realized I got scammed as she refused to answer my calls, texts or emails. They gave me a claim number of XXXX and a Reference number XXXX and after waiting 10 days told me to continue to try and contact this person that there was nothing they could do for me and closed my claim. I find it hard to believe that there is no way for the bank to track this person down. And harder to believe that the bank offers such a service of money transfer and does not offer me the consumer any protection at all."
895,"I had registered a complaint with Wells Fargo before ( XXXX ) regarding a closed credit card. In that case, I didnt receive information because Wells Fargo could not updated my contact details. At the closure of this case, Wells Fargo has stated they had updated my contact information to my current XXXX address and XXXX phone number. I have only an international number and no US cell phone number. 

Saturday ( XXXX ) I tried to make an internal bank transfer from my account to a friends Wells Fargo account. The internal bank transfer is known as XXXX. I did this using Wells Fargos mobile app in a logged in environment. The payment was blocked and the mobile app prompted me to call customer support to identify myself. 

I called the number and through Wells Fargos IVR, I provided my card number and gave my last 4 digits of my social security number. Once I was verified, I spoke with a representative that said I needed to receive an SMS for their internal 2-factor verification process in order to send my money to another Wells Fargo account. 

I told them I havent received an SMS and it was because they had a U.S. phone number registered on my account. Ultimately they failed to update my contact information from the previous CFPB case and have sent the code to a random number that was not me. I escalated and the next individual also said they they would not be able to help me move my money without a verification. I asked him to escalate it again but he told me to call back in 2 hours. I told him I would contact CFPB instead and I gave him the email address and he verified that it was the same email address on file. 

So through this process I was verified 4 times using 3 different sources ( email on file, card number and name on card & last 4 digital of SSN ). However, they said that I was not verified, but still discussed account details on my account. They allow refused to allow me to conduct an internal bank transfer with my money."
896,I was contacted by a hacked email from my college for a job opportunity and was told to send money for materials which I would be later reimbursed. I send a total of XXXX dollars on XX/XX/XXXX and received 2 fraudulent reimbursement checks. I sent another total of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and received 2 more fraudulent checks from them. The checks have bounced and I have no money in my account now. I tried contacting Wells Fargo for a refund on XXXX transfer but they said I wont get my money back.
897,"This is just about discriminatory business practice that WellsFargo is imposing against me, its long-time customer and an XXXX XXXX XXXX & XXXX XXXX veteran. Just 4 months ago, I was able to add/setup a non-WellsFargo account to my current WellsFargo account so I could transfer the funds back and forth, especially to make direct payment to my friend, who cut grass for me every month. The transaction was normally about $ XXXX/month. He just passed away so I removed his non-WellsFargo account to my current WellsFargo account. I then add another non-WellsFargo account ( i.e., my personal saving account at XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Unlike previous time, this time I am the owner of this non-WellsFargo account. By some reasons I could not transfer the funds between my WellsFargo accounts to my non-WellsFargo account, I then contacted WellsFargo customer service via secure message. 

On XX/XX/2018, I received the following response : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - From : Customer Service Sent : XX/XX/2018 XXXX XXXX Subject : Re : Transfer and deposit questions ( XXXX ) Dear XXXX XXXX : Thank you for contacting Wells Fargo. My name is XXXX, and I appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns. 

I understand that you are experiencing problem while transferring funds between your accounts. 

I reviewed your account and our records show that your trial deposit process was not completed successfully. We have removed the restraint so that you may re-attempt to validate the trial deposit. 

The trial deposit process is an added security measure that verifies that you own the non-Wells Fargo account that you are attempting to use for the Bank-to-Bank transfer service.

Here is how the Trial Deposit process works : 1. Wells Fargo makes two random ( less than {$1.00} ) deposits to your non-Wells Fargo accounts within three business days 2. You check your non-Wells Fargo account either online, via phone, or through your bank statement, to get the exact amount of each deposit 3. You sign on to wellsfargo.com and enter the trial deposit amounts to confirm that you received them and that you have access to the account Once the Trial Deposit process is successfully completed, you can begin to initiate transfers between your Wells Fargo and non-Wells Fargo accounts. 

For more information or assistance, please call us anytime at XXXX. 

On behalf of Wells Fargo, thank you for your business. We are happy to have you as our customer and appreciate the opportunity to assist you today. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX 
Wells Fargo -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I then contacted WellsFargo customer service and asked when the trial deposit was made.

My name is XXXX, and it is my pleasure to assist you today. 

I received your email regarding the account that you recently added to your Bank-to-Bank transfer service. 

I reviewed your account and based on the verification check for the Bank-to-Bank transfer service, your non-Wells Fargo account is not eligible for the service and can not be used for transfers or payments. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

If you have any additional questions regarding your account, please reply to this email or call us anytime at XXXX ( XXXX ). 

On behalf of Wells Fargo, thank you for your business. We are happy to have you as our customer and appreciate the opportunity to assist you today. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - This gave me the feeling that I am a victim of discriminatory business practice. On one response, WellsFargo said they lift the restriction. On the other, they said I was not qualified.

4 months ago, I was able to add my friend 's account ( non-WellsFargo account ) to mine, and this time I was not able to even add my own non-WellsFargo account. Also, I have not received any written notice or policy about the ability to add non-WellsFargo account. Why does WellsFargo keep conducting a type of hidden/forbidden bank services to its customers? Last time, they were hit with a class action lawsuit about their practices of opening new credit card accounts to customers that did not gave their authorization, and now they block their customers from adding their own non-WellsFargo account?

I just want you to please investigate before I decide to close all of my accounts with WellsFargo and move them to another banking institutions as they are not trusted to do the banking with.

Many thanks for your help to this XXXX XXXX XXXX veteran!

899,"I woke up this morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to see that a {$1000.00} withdrawal was made. I know I did not initiate this so I logged into my Wells Fargo App and saw there was a tele-transfer to some random account for XXXX. This transaction was posted yesterday on XX/XX/XXXX. It must have been after I looked in the morning since I always check all my bank accounts in the morning. I looked through every account I have with all institutions and found that I do not have an account ending in XXXX. ( I know this because the transaction was posted with XXXX ) and a reference number. I contacted Wells Fargo this morning and filed a claim for it. Since then they have suspended my online banking but I still have access to the physical bank, ATM, and my debit cards. I am filing a complaint here because I read that sometimes Wells Fargo and other large banks take an extended period of time and don't give my money back. I asked them to launch an investigation to find out how this happened. I received no email, no token, and no text to confirm that I was the one authorizing this transfer. Wells Fargo needs to step up their banking security."
904,"I received a text message from XXXX with the following text : Alert- ( my phone number ) from WellsFargo-Bank : Your Debit-Card is temporary Locked. Please call us now at XXXX. Thank you for your time Obviously, this is a scam. I did n't try calling them, but hopefully you guys can help in shutting them down. I 'm not sure whom else I should contact if this happens again.

906,"I am victim of theft by deception from a caller that showed up on my phone as XXXX support and I was told that my XXXX account had been hacked. I was told that XXXX security discovered 2 hacked financial transactions and that once I downloaded what I was told was an XXXX  operating system app the XXXX representative was going to walk me through the steps so that the alleged financial transactions could and would be reversed. The person had me use the XXXX  link from my bank which is Wells Fargo and the person was sending fake text codes for me to use in order to complete the fraudulent illegal transaction. 
I lost {$500.00} dollars as a result once I learned that I had been scammed I immediately filed a claim with Wells Fargo and a claim was filed with their online fraud department. I also have filed a police report which I was told that the police were contacting the secret service since the transaction involved money and possibly an international scam I am concerned that Wells Fargo is not going to return the funds which I cant afford to not recover. 

Any help is greatly requested and appreciated"
907,"My Name is XXXX XXXX XXXX, on XX/XX/2018 I wired {$80000.00}, XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account number XXXX and routing number is XXXX from my account in XXXX XXXX XXXX account # XXXX not knowing that someone have hack into the email and change the account number. I went to Wells Fargo to file a complaint, they suggest me to call their 800 number and talk to wire department. when I call them this morning they said they can not do anything because i don't own the account and they are not willing to put a note of suspicious activity with this on this account so no one can be harm again, because I have receive another email telling me wired it to different Wells Fargo account. # XXXX which does not belong to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They are kind of arrogant first they accept wired money which name and account does not match, yet they don't want to help me prevent other people from being a victim."
908,"In reference to Complaint # XXXX and Wells Fargos response I STATE the following. 
I did contact the Relevant State Agencies, as referenced by Wells Fargo, but was told that the BANK DID NEVER TURN IN THE MONEY IN QUESTION. they urged me to forcefully demand it from Wells Fargo."
911,"On or about XX/XX/2016 a promissory note was created, It was backed up by U C C codes and validation Acts of 1933, And Federal Reserve obligations etc. This promissory notes # XXXX was Notorized by a state of Nevada notary public and validated. This negotiable instrument was sent to : XXXX XXXX XXXX, CFO< Wells Fargo Bank Corp. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX. Note # XXXX was made out for : {$55000.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars and XXXX/XXXX ). After a real brutal divorce, my credit was very low and in negative standing. At the time i owed Wells Fargo Bank {$220.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars and XXXX/XXXX ). This negotiable instrument # XXXX was issued to settle my debt to Wells Fargo Bank, and the remaining balance of {$55000.00} was instructed to get deposited in my current account with Wells Fargo Bank, which was supposed to be used as capital for my current business : Handy 1 Contractors. I do complete home renovations and build homes whenever given a chance."
916,"Case reference : XXXX Wells Fargo Bank which I has been a customer since 2017 lied to me over the phone telling me every time I called a different story First they told me they need to verify a transaction sent to me by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX $ they needed documentation when I called again they told me they needed a notarized document signed by XXXX on the third call they told me they needed a Bank Letterhead from the sending bank. Finally I was able to sent the contract made before the sell was conducted they told me arbitrarily that it wasn't enough evidence. 

Also they told me that the only account that was gon na be closed was the affected one and them they are closing my whole relationship So I putting on this complain because every time I call a different story it's being told to me PRIVATE XXXX video of XXXX XXXX declaration XXXX : XXXXXXXX XXXX Also this was a private transaction that I made for me I needed to sell some BTC I own and I do it privately sometimes with all the due compliance and verification needed for a transaction this size. 

Who are you guys to decide what documentation is valid or no?"
918,"In trying to set up a new roommate, I was sent a Cashiers Check for {$2900.00}. Only part was supposed to be for rent, the remaining was to help set up a car for the college student coming to live in the room. I deposited the check on XX/XX/XXXX, waited until the XX/XX/XXXX to withdraw cash to send for the car payment, and then waited another day to send the money for the supposed car payment, and then another day for the second half of the payment. After {$2000.00} was sent for the car, the check, even though it is a cashiers check, was bounced the next evening. So now I am out {$2000.00} because Wells Fargo allowed the apparently fraudulent check to be cashed and make the funds available for multiple days. When I called them to deal with this issue, they refused to compensate the fraud even though it was them that allowed a supposedly secure check to process and then bounce. They will not own up to their fault in this fraud."
923,"On XX/XX/2022 I received a call claiming to be Wells Fargo. They were calling about suspicious XXXX transactions on my account. They provided some personal information and account information to verify and they spoofed the caller id number. They went through the process of "" canceling '' my debit card and then helped talk me through refunding the XXXX transactions that I said I never made. I couldn't see them online, but they assured me it's because they were under review for fraud. They had me set up a XXXX contact to under a number they gave me, listing my name and Refund as the contact name. I then sent XXXX dollars to this "" refund '' number, as instructed. They then asked me to do it again for {$500.00}, but at that time my roommate ( who was searching scams online ) showed me a story of a XXXX scam that was exactly like what I was going through. I immediately hung up and called the XXXX number on my debit card, where they confirmed that the person I spoke to was no a XXXX employee and I was, in fact, scammed. I immediately filed a fraud claim. A few weeks later, since I hadn't heard back from XXXX I called and was told that the WRONG fraud claim was filed. They had filed a debit card fraud claim, and apparently it should have been an online fraud claim ( or Vice Versa ). So another fraud claim was filed with XXXX for me. A few weeks later I received a letter stating my claim was denied because I authorized the payment. It is true, I authorized the payment because I was lied to by someone claiming to be a Wells Fargo employee. I gave up, until I talked to someone who went through the same thing, but then received an unexpected refund from XXXX, after their claim had already been denied. I have not received any money back and I am wondering why some people are being refunded for the same scam while others are not. It was incredibly violating and disheartening, as the XXXX representatives I spoke to when filing my claims made me believe this would be taken care of and I would get my money back. The only reason it didn't empty my bank account was I had just receive my tax return via direct deposit, otherwise I would have had nothing."
925,"On XX/XX/2018 I agreed to purchase two tickets to a XXXX XXXX game for {$250.00} total. The seller said he banked at Wells Fargo and preferred to use XXXX. I did not know anything about XXXX so I logged into my Wells Fargo app and XXXX showed as an option. I assumed there was purchase protection because it was endorsed by my bank and as the buyer stated, why would I use my bank account to do a fraudulent purchase? "". I transferred the money and never received the tickets and the person never returned calls. I immediately called my bank to try to cancel the transaction, they said that they had already sent it and I could not cancel. They said unfortunately because you authorized the purchase there is nothing we can do. There is no use in filing a report with our fraud department. He said I could file a police report if I wished to. If a bank is sending money to another bank, they would have that information. Wells Fargo refused to help."
926,On XX/XX/2019 I made a purchase through XXXX from a seller from XXXX XXXX. It was for the amount of {$140.00} dollars. I was messaging with the seller back and forth and the seller stated that after receiving payment they would ship out item. Unfortunately that was not the case the seller never sent item I was scammed. I reached out to my bank Wells Fargo that same day. I tried to see what I can do to prevent the transaction from going through and they said that I had to wait for the transaction to post. Then I had to call them back the next day to file a claim so that they could investigate. So the next day I called filed the claim they said it would take 10 days to investigate. I kept calling days after to check the status on my claim and Finally on day 10 the claim specialist said the case was closed and they wouldn't be able to help me. I think that they should be able to help their customers when it comes to matters of this sort because I called that same day to try to stop the transaction there should be something that they can do to prevent the transaction from going forward. I should have been able to dispute the transaction that same day with no issue instead of waiting 10 days for nothing to be resolved. XXXX as well as Banks fail to let their customers know about how in situations like this they can not do anything about it until it happens. After the customers are left with no money. I would like to get some type of reimbursement or courtesy refund for my troubles.I am so angry I will NEVER send money through XXXX ever again. This is ridiculous that there is no way to prevent this stuff from occurring and that they have XXXX customer service and can't help out in situations with fraud or scams. There should be a better way for them to track that money and if there is fraud or scamming involved the customer should be able to suspend the transaction!!!!
927,"XXXX XXXX XXXX, at my direction wired {$4500.00} dollars to a supposed company in XXXX XXXX, who used Wells Fargo bank as the depository. One last call to the XXXX XXXX police department alerted me to the fact that this company was fraudulent. 

An immediate call from me to XXXX was made to either stop or rescind the wire transfer. XXXX immediately issued a message to Wells Fargo to withdraw the wire transfer, providing Wells Fargo ample time to to follow the directive from XXXX to rescind. This entire send/rescind episode happened within approximately 72 minutes. 

Wells Fargo ignored the XXXX request and allowed the perpetrator to withdraw the money, it is believed several hours later, knowing that the entire incident was possibly a scam, which would have allowed the XXXX XXXX Police Department time to investigate the matter further which they were more than willing to help, according to the investigating officer, immediately."
928,"On XX/XX/2019, I found an ad on craigslist offering "" last minute XXXX tickets '' for a very discounted price. The seller sounded very nice over the phone and provided me with a plausible explanation as to why he could not attend this event. He said to me that we could do a smooth transaction via XXXX meaning that I will send him funds and he will email me his tickets right away. I know that XXXX works with all major banks including mine ( Wells Fargo ), so I assumed that it will be handled as any other bank transaction which is subject to consumer protection. 

Unfortunately, once I paid {$400.00} the "" seller '' disappeared. I called Wells Fargo 10 minutes after this transaction went through so they could stop or freeze the funds. Instead of that, they told me that there was nothing they could do, they did not even bother asking any details about this person so they can alert another bank where my money went to. I told them that I was defrauded, that I never received the tickets I paid for, they just simply did not care! Total ignorance on their end! As a bare minimum, they could have tried contacting a bank where my money went to and dispute it! No, nothing was done to return my funds! 

They ENDORSE this XXXX service, so they must give a clear disclosure to their customers that the money transfers are not protected against fraud, scam, etc. Yes, if fact, if you go to XXXX website and do a comprehensive online research you will find those disclosures, but, who would do it in such extent when this service is widely advertised and approved by your bank???? I am just an ordinary person with a minimum knowledge of banking system. I know that all my debit/credit/Pay Pal transactions are protected against fraud, so how would I know that this XXXX service is different???? 

The only reason why I used XXXX is because I was in total reliance on my bank that it will step in and dispute it in case something goes wrong. I have been their customer for 20 years, I have my mortgage, saving, checking, XXXX with them, you name it. This is the first time I ever filed a claim with them and the last thing I expected was the attitude like this. Not only they don't care about the online scam that happens every day, but they support it by their total ignorance and lack of desire to investigate the problem. 

I just want other consumers to be aware that If something goes wrong with their money they won't be protected by Wells Fargo by any way, shape or form. Wells Fargo should either have a system in place to protect their customers against fraud or, if they don't have this ability, then DON'T ENDORSE OR ADVERTISE this service to your customers, one way or another!"
929,"I need your assistance ; I have to resolve this situation, and to no avail has it been resolved. I complete a XXXX Money transfer from my Wells Fargo Checking account to XXXX XXXX, XXXX, email address XXXX. I transfer a total sum of {$350.00} on XX/XX/XXXX for the exchange of merchandise. After transferring the funds, XXXX XXXX changed her number, email, and her XXXX profile.

I contact wells Fargo today, XX/XX/2020, at XXXX XXXX at XXXX ; I was told that my claim was still being worked.

931,"I was involved in a fraudulent transaction involving Ms. XXXX XXXX from XXXX Missouri who indicated she had a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for sale. XXXX had indicated in her correspondence that vehicle was to be shipped by XX/XX/XXXX once the vehicle was sold to a buyer. 

Come to find out, this was all part of an internet scan involving XXXX XXXX and XX/XX/XXXXXXXX. I was informed to wire {$9000.00} into a trust account held at wells-fargo bank in the name of XXXX XXXX. That once the vehicle arrives, I will have about a week to decide if I wanted to take possession of the vehicle. ( see emails from XXXX XXXX and XX/XX/XXXXXXXX ). 

{$9000.00} was wired into a Wells-Fargo Bank account at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX MS XXXX into account holder XXXX XXXX XXXX account that was setup as a trust account. 
See XXXX XXXX XXXX address. Come to find out, this was a SCAN as XXXX and XXXX XXXX did not deliver the vehicle on Monday as planned. Attempted to reach out to XXXX and XXXX XXXX, but to no avail. 

Immediately contacted my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, MN and reported to the Fraud department that a scam had taken place.

I also called and spoke with a Fraud Department at Wells-Fargo, but was informed no information will be provided to me as I do not have an account with Wells-Fargo and they have to protect their client 's interest. Informed them that this was a fraudulent transaction, but to no avail."
933,"On Tuesday XX/XX/2019, I purchased tickets to an event on XXXX. Tickets were sent to me via XXXX ticket transfer and verified as real tickets into my account ( I even have a receipt from them ). I then proceeded to transfer XXXX $ into a fraudulent account via Well 's Fargo transferring service XXXX. Around 10 minutes later, I received a message from XXXX  saying the original tickets were purchased fraudulently ( using a fraudulent credit card ) and that the tickets in my account were cancelled. I contacted Well 's Fargo immediately, notifying them of the fraud that occurred and to ask them to return the money into my account. I informed them that the account on the other end of the transaction was either fraudulent or that someone stole their identity and that they shuld freeze that account immediately. The gentleman on the phone replied that it was a XXXX XXXX XXXX account that the money was sent into and that he would file a Fraud claim to get this resolved. 

That same night, I contacted XXXX to ask why they would send me verified tickets to an event that I purchased and then cancel them. They responded that they can only guarantee tickets that are bought on their website, but can not honor transferred tickets even though the tickets I purchased were legitimate seats that were just purchased from XXXX. 

That same night I filed a police report informing them of the scam and giving them any information about the individual who I bought the tickets from. 

Well 's Fargo never contacted me back, so tonight XX/XX/2019, I called them requesting an update. Supposedely my claim was never documented as a fraud claim and they never froze the fraudulent account on the other end ( even though I filed a police report, I offerred to show them the report, but they did not want it ). They said the customer care claim had been closed ( even though I was not notified ), and that I would not be getting a refund. They would not tell me anything regarding the fraudulent individual 's account or where my money went. I know Well 's Fargo had many issues in the past with them allowing fraudulent accounts and having millions of individuals ' account information stolen. I asked if this individual was one of those accounts, but they refused to give me any information. I spoke to them for 2 hours on the phone, being bounced around and given the run around. In the end they said nothing could be done and that I was wasting my time because I authorized the transaction. This is furthest from the truth, I did not authorize a transaction into a fraudulent account that should have never been allowed to be made. XXXX is apart of a XXXX XXXX  that requires photo ID and social security numbers to open. If the fraudulent account was never opened or never got stolen, the transfer of my funds would have never went through. It is something Well 's Fargo should have prevented. I have a Well 's Fargo claim number if needed ( although it is closed apparently ) I have a police report number if  needed"
935,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was scammed by a Wells Fargo member who also committed insurance fraud. I was tricked into purchasing fake insurance for a potential residential cleaning contract, which was also a scam. I was told since my LLC was less than 2 years old, the only way the company would issue the policy was for me to pay the down payment on the yearly premium which was {$1800.00}. After going through what was said to be underwriting, the rep came back and said the only way to get the policy issued was to pay the entire year upfront which required me to send another {$1800.00} via cashiers check and deposit the funds in what was supposed to be the CEOs account being there card system was down. Remind you, the contract was for {$160000.00} for 4 months. I have emails, recorded calls, a police report ect. After the funds was sent on XX/XX/XXXX, we had a scheduled meeting at the condominium that we were suppose to be cleaning at XXXX but no one showed up which raised a red flag. So after being put on the run around for the next 4 hours, we realized we were scammed unfortunately. After I filed the police report, I went straight to Wells Fargo where the money was deposited. They told me they were not taking walk ins and that I would have to schedule an appointment which I did. However, it was for a week later. On XX/XX/XXXX I decided to call Wells Fargo and see if I could get things done over the phone. I spoke with a rep there, provided him with everything that happened. He told me Wells Fargo would begin an investigation. Another 3 days went by without me hearing back from them so I decided to call back. This time I was told something completely different. I was told they had no record of the complaint I had previously submitted being it was not properly submitted. I had to go through everything again to be placed in a waiting pattern again. On XX/XX/XXXX it would have been a full month since the scam and I have yet to hear back from Wells Fargo. No one called me to request additional information regarding the scam, which I was also a advised. With this amount of time between the incident, the criminal will be long gone. I demand a full reimbursement of my {$3800.00}. Me and my wife had to miss work, waste gas and time, fees to get the cashiers check not to mention delayed on closing on our home being the {$3800.00} was part of the down payment and closing cost."
936,"Wells Fargo let individuals come into their branch, commit fraud and violet The Patriot Act. They did not investigate and treat the victims as the criminals. My family was threatened, job and marriage if I went to the police. I submitted documentation to the FBI, Local Police and Secret Service surrounding these wire transfers. 383 pages of documents went to all banks and police. The individuals also said if I went to the police they would say the money was for XXXX   plots or to XXXX my wife. Last XX/XX/2018, I notified Wells Fargo of wrongdoings in their checking accounts and asked them to investigate. Basically, use the information that they used to open the accounts such as social security, DMV, etc. and gave them names of law enforcement to reach if needed. Several letters later, Wells Fargo would rather protect the rights of criminals and violate the patriot act then investigate. They stole my identity thru DMV records and social security. There have been little discussions with Wells Fargo executive and fraud group because they will not do anything even though I am a customer. We will end up in court due to their hindrance of an investigation and violating The Patriot Act!"

938,"I was put in touch with what I thought was a legitimate distributor of liquor through XXXX. He had a XXXX page for his business. He stated that he had 2 cases of XXXX XXXX XXXX  available and he would sell them for a reasonable price. If I purchased both cases he said he would include the shipping. Total cost for the bourbon was {$700.00}. He said he accepted XXXX as payment which my bank, Wells Fargo, has as a payment option so I figured it was safe since it was from Wells Fargo and not a third party. I sent him {$500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and the remaining {$200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo has a limit of {$500.00} in 24 hrs so that is why I sent two different payments. After I sent the money the seller then asked for more to cover insurance. I then realized I had fallen for a scam and asked for my money back. The seller insisted I send him the extra money, when I didn't he stopped responding to my messages. 

I contacted Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX and explained to them what had happened. I had to make 2 separate cases since there were 2 different payments made. They said they would review the case and contact the receiving financial institution. I was told if they didn't hear anything back in 1 week they would credit my account the money until there was a resolution. I called 3 times in XXXX trying to get updates and I was always told that someone would call back but no one ever did. I finally received 2 letters from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX 2021 stating that they were unable to recover any money and the case was closed. 

I would like to know how a financial institution such as Wells Fargo can offer a payment service with no protection offered."
939,"I responded to an ad post on XXXX that was selling 2 tickets to a "" Dead and Company '' concert at the XXXX XXXX in Washington State on XXXX XX/XX/2019. This incident occurred on XX/XX/2019. 

The ad ( since removed ) listed 2 tickets for {$120.00} each and provided a phone number ( XXXX ). The ad listed XXXX, XXXX and a few other options for payment, and stated that the tickets would be transferred over XXXX after payment. 

I sent a text message to the above number making an offer of {$140.00} for the pair of tickets, adding that I could make the payment over XXXX. Almost immediately, I received a response accepting the offer, but saying their XXXX was not working and asking to transact over XXXX. 

I had used XXXX once or twice in the past, so I didn't think much of it and agreed. The seller sent me the following information for the XXXX money transfer. 
Name : XXXX XXXX. Email : XXXX I transferred {$140.00} through XXXX from my Wells Fargo online account. A few minutes later, the seller said he received the notification from XXXX but "" cancelled it by accident '', and that my money would be returned in 24 hours. He asked me to resend the payment. 

I sent him a screenshot from my side showing the confirmation number from XXXX. He insisted twice that I should try resending him the money. At this point I knew I was in a scam. After I asked him for a screenshot of the "" cancellation '', he went silent and thereafter never responded. 

The following day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I could see in in Wells Fargo account that the money had been taken out. I desperately sent another text to the above phone number, and even tried calling it to no avail. Seeing that the post was still up, I reported it to XXXX. Unfortunately, in my distressed state I did not remember to take a screenshot. 

On the same afternoon I called Wells Fargo and reported the scam. They took down the information and filed a claim. After about 2 weeks, I received a letter from them stating there was no error on their part, and they were closing the claim. I called them one last time to explain the issue on XX/XX/2019. The agent told me that transacting on XXXX is like transacting with cash and should only be done with known parties. 

While I now understand that Wells Fargo or XXXX do not guarantee against scams such as this one, I  think they can not shrug off all responsibility, since the scam occurred on their system. The scammer is presumably still using their facilities to defraud well meaning, unsuspecting users. At the very least they should make efforts to track down the scammer. I will not use XXXX again unless offered a one-time refund for this incident."

949,"I was referred to make this complaint directly to your agency by the Federal Reserve on XXXX XXXX, 2022. 

I am a XXXX, XXXX American citizen. On XX/XX/2022 I contacted supposed branch manager, XXXX by phone around XXXX : XXXX because I had purchased a XXXX XXXX money order at XXXX in XXXX in the amount of {$180.00} that had not been cashed. XXXX stated to cash it at Wells Fargo as it was over a month old. It was drawn on Wells Fargo Bank printed on the XXXX. XXXX instructed me to cash it at my nearest W.F. branch which was in XXXX, XXXX on XXXX. However, they refused to cash it, so I called XXXX back from the bank. He instructed me to come into his branch in XXXX XXXX with my I.D . and he could cash/refund it. I traveled about 15 minutes to the branch, but upon parking in handicapped parking space, entering bank, XXXX and I noticed each other. He ogled me then took a long time to acknowledge me though he saw me enter. I sat down waiting for him, but then asked a clerk if I could speak with him. XXXX had already been pacing around as a chicken with no head, and even grabbed and XXXX  XXXX XXXX  customers as they entered the bank hugging them inappropriately as they stood awkwardly in shock. Finally, after many minutes, he called me up. He said he knew I was XXXX XXXX about the XXXX. drawn on Wells Fargo Bank over the phone ; apparently he assumed I was XXXX  over the phone, but when he saw I was XXXX and holding the m.o., his intent was to refuse service to me. He huffed and puffed and a XXXX XXXX teller said "" Oh, no worries he'll take good care of you ''. XXXX did not take care of me then went away and then came back abruptly saying "" OK, XXXX, I am not going to cash this money order for you ''! - very loudly where all other agents looked on puzzled at me. The female teller look over at the situation. I asked why, but then he started making up excuses back talking that he didn't promise me he was going to cash it, walking back everything he'd promised over the phone. I advised him that I was XXXX and traveled out here by his instruction. He continued making a spectacle of me loudly purposely looking around as if he was on stage to everyone and behaved as if disgusted with me, trying to draw attention by his XXXX  co-workers, and customers. It was as if he had something to prove to all the XXXX in the bank. I was so embarrassed and felt humiliated, even discriminated against, traumatized by XXXX and he's a XXXX male. I asked how to make a formal complaint, but he said I'd have to sit and wait a long while as he and his staff were too busy. More abuse... I asked how could I file a complaint outside this branch but he said I'd have to do it there? I just calmly turned and began walking away when I noticed him grimacing with nasty faces snapping his head and neck at me while gesturing with his head and making a grunting sound with his voice "" Yeah, that's what I thought ''. I felt even more humiliated and just proceeded to leave the bank. My fiance was with me who has had a Wells Fargo account for about 15 plus years of which I advised XXXX of this over the phone and in person that it was another means to cash/refund the m.o. It was obvious that XXXX was prejudice of me being a XXXX woman and had to sickly, unprofessionally appease his XXXX  counterparts and all in the bank that I was to be denied service and put on public display while he was engaging in this self-hate and hatred of me because he was proving something racially oppressive against me to impress the XXXX  customers and co-workers. XXXX behaved like what is known as a XXXX or XXXX  XXXX. I was so traumatized because he had originally agreed over the phone to cash it possibly drawing it off my fianc account, but when he saw I was XXXX I was never to get the XXXX. cashed professionally or respectably from his bank. He knew everything about the XXXX. when I fist spoke to him before traveling to his branch. I never forget about this matter as I have been undergoing personal health, etc., matters, so I am taking the time to remit this complaint to you for action against the bank, XXXX, and for resolve. XXXX is embarrassed of his own race, and it was apparent that he engaged in discrimination, that he felt the need to set good with the XXXX openly, both agents and patrons of the bank in refusing service to me he previously promised before I got there. It may cost him and the bank a great deal more now. Thank you for disciplinary action and relief."

958,"Scam victim thru wells Fargo for XXXX on XX/XX/2021. I contacted police they said they couldn't do anything in XXXX, I reported to fbi scam site. I Contacted wells fargo by phone, next day went to branch and then contacted someone higher at wells fargo to open investigation and I quickly was told nothing could be done. I hold wells fargo responsible for waiting until scammers bank opened and they got my money and if wells fargo would have did something when I called they could have saved my money by freezing or reversing it. Here is what happened. 


I was a victim of scam. Scammers claimed they charged me XXXX for XXXX XXXX and for refund to contact. When I contacted for a refund they said they would refund me. When they put in XXXX they acted like they put XXXX XXXX be refunded. They had a wells fargo fake page with the XXXX deposited into my fake page account. They were threatening me to give that money back. Now somehow on there fake page it had charges I had made to other stores. I was scared from their threats and the man told me they would come after me if I hang up phone. He said the fbi would be at my house and seize everything we own. The fake page looked real as my bank account showing a XXXX deposit. I am a honest person and would never keep someone elses money so I did what I thought a honest person should do, give it back. I was to scared and confused to even think all I knew was I didn't want to get in trouble. My fear took over not wanting harm for my family. This was aound XXXXXXXX XXXX I was ordered to go to bank and send wire to their bank while they stayed on phoned through whole process.I was terrified of what they would do to me or my family. After wire was sent I came back home and calmed down I then begin to feel I may have been scammed so I looked at my wells fargo account. There was no XXXX deposit, only XXXX wire sent from me. I immediately called wells fargo and told them what happened this was around XXXX XXXX I was told I had to wait until the banks opened the next day and told not to worry Id get my money back. I told them they had to do something before the scammers bank opened or the money would be gone. Wells fargo reassured me they would get my money back when the banks opened the next day 14 hours later. I was at wells fargo when they opened the next day and the lady that helped me send wire told me I thought you were being scammed, wow, but she didn't even try to help me not do this. she knew I was scared. Wells fargo got in touch with the scammers bank and funds had been with drawled just like I thought. My complaint is why would no one help me before 14 hours passed giving the scammers just enough time to take the money wells fargo could have froze, reversed, something. In this day in time I can not believe wells fargo had my interest at heart or they could not have done something to save my money. Their is no way I can believe wells fargo did everything they could until 14 hours. Why did wells fargo refuse to do anything for 14 hours. Wells fargo does not care about their customers. They could have got my money back if they would have acted in a timely matter."
961,"Starting on XX/XX/2022, I received a call from Wellsfargo customer service number as it showed up on my caller ID, I spoke with the representative who informed me of a suspicious EFT that was initiated and wanted to confirm if it was me and if I knew the person it was going to. I said that I Do Not authorize that transfer and have no idea who that person is. 
They informed me that they would start an investigation on it and verified me through the Wellsfargo text message ( as usual ). They went on to say they would call me with an update the next day. They called me on the XX/XX/XXXX and advices that one of my XXXX  devices ( phone or laptop ) appears to have been hacked and that I should NOT log into my online bank account while there investigation is continuing. 
Monday XX/XX/XXXX, they call me back with another update. After verifying me they inform me that a few more EFTs were initiated and asked if I had authorized them. I said absolutely NOT. They suggested I should schedule an appt to go into the branch to close out my account and open a new one. They offered to help coordinate the appt for the next day Tuesday afternoon at XXXX. 
Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX, I receive a call in the morning from them again, after they verify me, they inform me that the banker who was scheduled to meet with me called out sick and we would need to reschedule to the following day. So we scheduled it again. 
Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I arrive to my local branch for my appt to find out that nothing was on the calendar. Once I was informed of this information I immediately contact the Wellsfargo fraud department to verify if they have any notes on my account. They did Not. 
This whole time I was speaking with scammers impersonating Wellsfargo, while at the same time calling Wellsfargo and impersonating me. The whole time I was being asked to verify myself it was the scammers who were having WF sending me the verification code so they could repeat it back to WF. At no point did I authorize any of the 4 EFTs that were taken out of my bank account, totaling in the amount of {$75000.00}. 
According to research, this should fall under the category of a Regulation E claim, but Wellsfargo is claiming because it was a domestic transfer that it would not qualify. 

So far, out of the {$75000.00} loss Wellsfargo was able to retrieve {$16000.00}. They claim {$23000.00} is for sure gone and the remaining missing balance might only result in a partial payment. 
Given the sophistication of this scam of impersonation and lack there of on the part of Wellsfargo for properly authenticating me. I believe that I should be refunded in full on all my losses within the specific timeframe. As a consumer I would think there would be liability protection for any fraudulent activity in which I did not initiate nor did I give any verbal authorization for."

A remaining {$160000.00} has yet to be returned to me and I have received no information on how the amount returned was calculated and where the rest of my money is."
966,"I am XXXX. I used XXXX to purchase a XXXX XXXX XXXX from a XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, Il. I sent {$3500.00} by XXXX Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2022. The XXXX salesman scammed me into sending the money to his personal XXXX  account. He said his account was linked to the dealer. Before my XXXX  was shipped, the dealer owner discovered the theft. Police were called. I was assured I would have the XXXX  I paid for in full. I also paid {$1500.00} by debit card for a total of {$5000.00}. This is the {$5000.00} purchase price in full of the XXXX. 

I have never gotten the XXXX or my money back. The XXXX dealer returned the {$1500.00} paid by debit card. I complained to XXXX on XX/XX/2022 and on XX/XX/2022 they denied my email. I complained again to Wells Fargo and on XX/XX/2022 they refuse to cover any of my loss. 

The XXXX dealer does not return my contacts."
970,"Called Wells Fargo ( WF ) in XXXX to do a rollover of my XXXX into XXXX XXXX as I have a new employer. Received check a few weeks later, and sent into XXXX. No issues. 

Logged back into my WF account mid XXXX, and realized there will still funds in my XXXX after I had done a full rollover. Called WF, spoke to a helpful person who explained : 1. I had gotten a dividend, and would still be receiving another company match first thing in XXXX, and that I needed to wait, and call in after the first week of XXXX where I would then do a final rollover request and get one more check for XXXX, before XXXX out the account. I asked if there would be tax implications, and was told here would not be. I set a calendar reminder to call WF on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I received a check on or about 7/8 for the reminder of my XXXX less taxes ( {$190.00} ) in a form of a check made out to me individually. I immediately called WF and was told there was nothing they could do about it, it was policy to send a check to the individual if it was less than a certain amount. I explained what I was told by the representative in XXXX. They said they would investigate my complaint and call me back within few weeks. MY complaint was that I had been explicitly told to do something, and before I was able to do it on the date I was told to do it on, XXXX took out {$190.00} in taxes which I should not have to pay because I intend to roll this money into a XXXX. 

Received a call back on XX/XX/XXXX from WF rep. He stated he listed to my recorded call and the woman did tell me to call back and request a rollover, but my money was immediately sent out instead of being held in the account so I could ask for the rollover. I asked how I could get the {$190.00} refunded and the check reissued to XXXX for the rollover. Was told there is nothing they can do about it. Also suggested to open an IRA to get around tax penalty. Asked if WF would pay for IRA opening and account fees, as I do not have and IRA, I have a XXXX only. They said they could not. 

I was told I have to write to the plan administrator, who would not be able to help me as they sent a disclosure which said any funds left in the account will be sent to individual and not done in a rollover. I explained that is not what happened, I was told to do this by the representative after receiving those disclosures. I was told to do something different than the policy from a person working there who said it would be okay, and I will still penalized the {$190.00}. 

I am asking for CFPB to intervene, and have WF reimburse me the {$190.00} as they provided incorrect information which led to a tax penalty which is avoidable were it not for their providing inaccurate information when I called in XXXX and early XXXX to resolve this issue."
971,"On XXXX XXXX I was trying to buy a product from someone online. I sent the money using XXXX as its through Wells Fargo and I thought I would be protected because its a transaction through my bank, however this was not the case. When I called to make a report of this I was greeted with a brick wall. The customer service rep was condescending and not much help as she filed my complaint. I never received any follow up through the course of their investigation. They closed my claim and didn't even notify me, I found out by calling to check on the status of the claim. Wells Fargo should be ashamed to partner/work with a company that offers its consumers no safety net. So I was scammed out of {$400.00} and thats unfortunate for me. Please, DO NOT SEND MONEY THROUGH XXXX!"

XXXX XXXX  completed the transaction, and the wire was received by Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2022 at XXXX hrs.

On the morning that I was to drive to SC I received an email with a screen shot from Wells Fargo stating that the funds were withdrawn from her account because the money order was determined altered / fictitious. My reservation was cancelled and I did not go. 
XXXX claims no responsibility. The woman claims no responsibility ( it seems she did not get her money ). Wells Fargo will not talk to me as it is her account. However I paid XXXX XXXX to investigate this and they said the funds were paid to Wells Fargo. 
I hold Wells Fargo accountable and want my money returned either to me or to XXXX XXXX so they can refund me."

As soon as the scammer blocked me, I directly informed Wells Fargo and made a claim that I was scammed. Three weeks later, I received their conclusion and that they deny my claim because I authorized the transactions and that the recipient 's bank nor Wells Fargo had any error. I called and asked for further information, and inquired about EFT Regulation E and thr Wells Fargo banker told me that it only applies if I was induced to giving my information, which is not what my case is. They told me there's nothing they can do. To add salt to wound, I involved my brother and used his money by asking him to send money by XXXX in his Wells Fargo."

Once per week I called with different agents to check the progress and the answer is always its still in progress and I need to wait. Every week I call and I do understand that its take time because its international wire transfer.

I admitted I made the mistakes because I got scammed and I reported to you to seek for your help. But when you told me there is nothing you can do because i authorized the transfer is not make sense, i am a victim ( a fraud victim ) since i authorized the transfer. She even told me that i should confirm the amount before I authorized the transfer. I think she needs to learn the meaning of being a victim fraud. I did check the amount, not only when i did the wire transfer but even when i did XXXX I checked the amount, but the problem is not that I didnt check the amount. The problem is i was scammed therefore I made those transaction.

I was to receive a check in this amount plus taxes from Wells Fargo within 21 days according to the mediator. That date would have been XX/XX/XXXX. But as of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I have NOT received the above amount by check and have been given the excuse that the "" system '' of the Mediation Office in XXXX, OR, is down. I asked ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) the Mediation representative at Wells Fargo, the woman who has worked on my claim since XXXX, XXXX, when this "" system went down, '' she stated that it was a week ago.

988,"I have been a business customer of Wells Fargo since XXXX with multiple accounts, on Tuesday XXXX I received a letter from Wells ( attached ) and a cashiers check for erroneous fees with interest ( reimbursement for one of my wells accounts that was closed, I am still a wells business customer ) Because of the high amount of the cashiers check I called the number on the letter and on the cashiers check and they verified that it was correct. I am still a customer of wells so I went into a branch to speak to a banker about it, they contacted the wells department that issued the cashiers check and the branch manager ( XXXX, XXXX XXXX Branch ) spent 30+ minutes on the phone with the corporate office reviewing my account and they verified that the payment from wells was accurate and it was from the overdraft fee case. I asked for a reconciliation of the payment but they could not provide one but assured me it was accurate. I deposited the cashiers check into my wells business account and once the funds we released and cleared, I proceeded to make payment to creditors of mine and settlement agreements and I released the funds for those payments from my account. The following afternoon I logged into my wells account and found it was XXXX. The cashiers check from wells that cleared was removed by wells with no explanation. With my account XXXX over drawn, I contacted everyone possible and was told that the resolution department is looking into and that they believe it was a bank error and that it happened to hundreds of customers, finally a week later I received a letter in the mail with a "" substitute check '' with a notation on it that said it is a legal document to be used in the same way the original cashiers check could be used. I called the automated phone number on the cashiers check and the was told that the item was reported as lost, stolen, or damaged and stopped. I did not report the item as lost stolen or damaged Finally yesterday I received a call from XXXX XXXX from Wells Fargo stating that it was an error but they will bring my account to a XXXX balance and send me a XXXX for the funds.

989,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent {$500.00} to someone that I spoke with over the phone who ended up being a scam artist via the XXXX app through Wells Fargo. This was my first time using the online money transfer method, and I thought that because it was advertised within my banking app, that there would be an element of protection available. When the person who received my money stopped responding, I immediately placed a call to my bank to try and cancel the money transfer and submitted a claim the same day. When I submitted the claim, the agent said someone else would call me when my claim would be assigned to gather more information. No one contacted me. I received a letter in the mail saying that there was no error on the banks part and I would not be able to have any protection or refund for my transaction. It is very disappointing as a long time customer of Wells Fargo that the bank would promote an app that ( as I researched ) many scammers are now using. There is no warning of this on the site and I think there should be either a scammer warning, or these banks should partner with an app that has more financial protection ( like XXXX ). The false sense of protection that XXXX gives bank customers by being directly linked to the bank is detrimental- the scam artist even milked this sense of protection to me over the phone. Please let me know what further steps I can take to receive a refund and hopefully protect others from encountering the same scam as mine. Currently, I reopened my claim in hopes of a different outcome."

My rent is due on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and they sent me to a branch to get a provisional credit.

I've filed an online FBI wire fraud report, as well as started a formal wire recall request with my originating bank ( XXXX XXXX ) but after 7 days of Wells Fargo failing to answer to my bank 's formal recall request, XXXX informed me that the recall isn't going to work.

The ATM gave me an error message and told me to contact my financial institution. I did not get any money, but it shows as a completed transaction in XXXX. I have contacted XXXX who initially refunded me and then later, took the money back and stated that the money was due to the merchant. I reached out to Wells Fargo directly, called, emailed and even went to the Branch where it happened. After several phone calls from Wells Fargo representatives ( who were very nice ) and promises to help, I was told there was no way they could track the ATM balance and could not help me since I was not a Wells Fargo customer. So basically, I am just out of {$220.00} an Wells Fargo has no liability even though it was thier ATM machines that faltered. I have used this card many times in the past to withdraw cash and have never had an issue, this time the money did not disburse and I feel it was an ATM error ; however Wells Fargo did nothing to get my funds back to me, and basically said since I dont have a Wells Fargo ATM card, they could not track it. They called me and claimed they did a thorough investigation- but there was no mention of my money being returned - just them again reiterating that they could not track my card ( which I did not ask them to do ). They CAN assess the balances in those ATM machines, along with how much was in the ATM machine, and how much was disbursed. And, if the money was disbursed after me to someone else, they also have cameras on those machines. It can not be impossible for a BANK to track the money disbursed from thier ATM machines. I need my {$220.00} back and would appreciate some help. This is unfair to me and poor practice from the bank as they claim to have all these security measures in place..cameras and accurate accounting are part of security too.

1000,"XX/XX/19 I brought a cashier 's check from a respected XXXX bank into a local Wells Fargo branch to deposit. My timing was based on the goal to deposit it on a day with a higher conversion rate. I brought in a print out from their website showing that day 's rate ( 0.8029 US $ per 1 CAD $ ). The amount was CAD {$190000.00}. 
I had shown them that day 's exchange rate from the website. Managers at the branch discussed it for 15-20 minutes while I was in the waiting area. I was informed that it would be processed through the Wells Fargo Foreign Collection Service and fees would also be assessed. The process would take 4-10 weeks. I was concerned about the potential for the exchange rate to change significantly during this period. I was then told that I would get the best rate during the time period until the deposit cleared. I confirmed two more times to ensure I understood correctly and again was told it would be at the .803 rate or higher. I agreed to proceed based on this. 
On XX/XX/19, my Wells Fargo account was credited US {$140000.00}. This was based on a .744 exchange rate and less US {$200.00} fees. This was based on corporate policies that I was not made aware of. The branch did not provide the correct information to me. Using the minimum .8029 rate  discussed with them on XX/XX/19, the deposit amount should have been US {$150000.00} ( after fees were removed ). This is a difference of US {$11000.00}. I had agreed to the fees and have no issue with paying them. 
On XX/XX/19, I contacted the Wells Fargo branch and asked to make an appointment to discuss this. They said they would have manager call me. After connecting, it was agreed to forward the complaint to the Wells Fargo resolution department. A contact from that group was very helpful and kept me updated about the status of the resolution process. 
On XX/XX/19, the resolution contact called me and told me the offer from the branch is to refund the service fees of {$200.00}. I declined the offer and requested not to have the funds deposited in my account. I indicated I would seek alternate methods to have this resolved satisfactorily.

I could see that the funds were transferred and was relieved the Rep had helped me. I was relieved that Wells Fargo appeared to have been protecting me from further fraud. 
My accounts registered zero the following morning. I reported the incident and was assured the matter would be corrected within 10 days. Luckily, I have another account with a credit Union I could live on. Wells Fargo responded in 15 days ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and failed to acknowledge that I was a victim of a crime.

I continued to search for help and answers. I was met at resistance at every corner.

There were four checks sent to my email the amounts following, {$1000.00}, {$1000.00}, {$1500.00}, {$2500.00}. I unfortunately fell victim to the scam and tried to deposit said checks and attempted the credit card payment with the information provided on XX/XX/22.

After the claims were filed on XX/XX/22, I spoke with Wells Fargo 's Fraud Claim department again on XX/XX/22, to follow up on my claims. The one transaction on a {$400.00} XXXX payment was reversed, but the other {$500.00} XXXX payment and {$1000.00} XXXX charge were not reversed. I contacted XXXX on XX/XX/22 to file a claim on the {$1000.00} XXXX payment, but I was told since I do not have payment protection, there would be very little chance to get my money refunded."
1021,"I have had a Wells Fargo checking account since XXXX. I recently discovered that XXXX was added to my account as a money transfer service. I used it a few times and decided I did not want it. 

There have been many stories recently in the XXXX  XXXX and elsewhere about theft and robberies using XXXX, which the banks refuse to reimburse for because they claim the transfers were "" authorized '' -- even if the authorization was at gunpoint. 

I attempted to remove XXXX from my checking account, or deactivate ( deauthorize ) it, and discovered I can not. It is required with a Wells Fargo checking account. So, the service is required and can not be deactivated, but if theft occurs using it, the bank will not accept responsibility even though it is forcing the account holder to have this feature. 

This is wrong and imposes a significant risk on me ( and others like me who do not want or need this types of service ). I could go elsewhere, but it appears the owners of XXXX include the other major banks as well, and I suspect the policy is the same. Thus, my complaint is that my bank will not allow me to remove XXXX from my checking account, causing me significant risk which they also refuse to cover."
1023,Wellfargo I have a lot of transactions happen to my bank account that I never recognize them Some transactions I never did to my bank account and also I saw some using my name that I have social but I never have Social number ever since because Im applying until now of my change status in XXXX  for XXXX visa
1025,"On Saturday XX/XX/XXXX I was in contact with a seller ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) on XXXX. He was selling a transmission for a car. I tried several different way to pay for this item. XXXX was not working at the time and the seller suggested using XXXX stating that it was free and safe.I found that this app was a feature that appeared to be backed by my bank. All I had to do was log into my Wells Fargo App and click on a button that said send money with XXXX. I used this feature within my Wells Fargo app to send him a deposit of XXXX. Once he received that I sent him the remaining XXXX on the same day. This larger amount did not actually go through until XX/XX/XXXX according to the XXXX Activity Log. The seller was very active with talking to me and confirming my information and promising shipment as soon as the money was received. I have not heard from the seller since that day. I filed a claim with XXXX and they responded that they would not step in until XX/XX/XXXX. At that time they informed me that since I did not use XXXX they would not assist me. I requested that this seller be block and complaint be filed. I then called my bank Wells Fargo who told me that "" I knowingly sent the money and they would not assist me either ''. I tried reaching out to them again since there has to be a way for them to do a take-back or a reversal of the money. They said there is nothing they can do even if I misspelled the email address that I was sending it to they would not be able to stop it. I did reply to a video that Wells Fargo posted about XXXX and how easy it was to use. This got someone from their social media account to reach out to me who did not assist me either. He just kept saying that it says in really fine print about liability and limitations. I am currently out XXXX I have all the emails back and forth with this seller and the confirmations from XXXX of the transfers. Neither XXXX or Wells Fargo will assist me."
1029,"On XX/XX/XXXX I sold an item to XXXX XXXX, and she paid for the item by transferring the money to me in XXXX. 

Just a few days later, Wells Fargo would lock me out of my account, leaving me without access to the funds in the account, the transaction information, balance information, etc. It would not be until XXXX, that I finally received a letter from Wells Fargo, stating that my account was in the clear and that I could resume business as usual. 

The account had been locked and placed under investigation due to an amount charged back by a XXXX payment that was sent to me. 

I logged into my account, and much to my dismay and surprise, XXXX dollars had been removed from the account, without even so much as a note or memo as to what the funds were removed for. 

It was not until later that I called Wells Fargo, and was transferred around numerous times, that I finally was informed that the money was removed from my account because a zelle transaction sent to me in the amount of XXXX dollars was flagged as fraudulent by Wells Fargo, and the funds were subsequently taken out of my checking account and given to the individual named at the opening. 

In searching for a way to appeal this, as I had informed Wells Fargo that I had proof of purchase, I was once again transferred numerous times until I reached tier-whatever support. 

The individual I spoke with, which by the way, was a very rude encounter, as he would not let me finish a sentence before butting in constantly and trying to talk over me, informed me that Wells Fargo would not be doing anything about it, there was no appeals process available to elect, and that if I wanted the money back, to contact XXXX and take her to court. 

This is just preposterous. How can the bank just reach into my account, take my money, and then sit around with their hands in their pockets, when I find out what has transpired and object? When this investigation was underway, no one bothered to reach out to me to let me know what was going on, no one asked me to forward any evidence or proof that I had readily available in order to help my case and protect myself from the dishonesty that the buyer was perpetuating. Where was Wells Fargo when it should have been my turn to tell my side of the story? 

And now, the damage is done, Im out of the money, and still, Wells Fargo wants to do nothing to help me, to listen to me, to see the proof that I have. They say they are not allowed, and I am calling them on the XXXX. I should not have to rely on the court system to recover my money. I should be able to keep money in my bank account and rest assured that the bank is there to protect me, not be an entity from which I need to protect myself. Please help me, this is not fair, and its something that would honestly be devastating should I not be able to come to a swift and fair resolution. 

Best, XXXX"
1030,"I have been applying through XXXX and similar sights for "" XXXX XXXX '' positions. On XX/XX/2022, I received an email from "" XXXX XXXX from XXXX '' claiming they had reviewed my resume and were interested in having me go through an online interview. Over the course of a few more emails they accepted me for hire, and sent me an Offer Letter which I signed and sent back. On the letter was a list of office equipment I was to acquire. He instructed me to print out a "" Soft Check '' for {$4900.00}, which he had emailed to me. Once I mobile deposited the check and it cleared with Wells Fargo, the next day I made XXXX wire transfers, one being through XXXX. I continued to exchange emails with this person, as he explained my name needed to be on the check to acquire the office equipment after XXXX weeks of employment. I found this to be fishy, but everything had been so elaborate I went with it. And eventually the communication stopped, and I was left disputing the scam through Wells Fargo. After a month or so, Wells Fargo denied both wire and XXXX dispute, claiming that because I made the transaction, I was responsible and have to take the loss. I am searching for legal advice at the moment, as I believe Wells Fargo should have put a hold on the check for 10 business days. Because they cleared the check in one day I came to believe it was a good check."
1031,"I had a personal check from XXXX written on XX/XX/XXXX, in the amount of {$500.00} addressed to the "" City of XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '', fraudulently altered to {$9500.00} and signed and cashed by an individual at a local XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo bank on XX/XX/XXXX after it was intercepted in the mail. I first reported it to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX by filling out a Declaration of Unauthorized Endorsement or Altered Item, at their request. I was repeatedly told that Wells Fargo was non-responsive in communication, despite initially being told that the errand would be solved in 90 days. On XX/XX/XXXX, more than 90 days after I first filled out the Declaration of Unauthorized Endorsement or Altered Item '', I filled out the same paperwork again... I was again told my case would be solved within 90 days, even though I explained that I had already waited 90 days from the first report. I called the XXXX claims department 90 days later ( XX/XX/XXXX ) in hopes of finally getting my money back, but all I was told was that XXXX had interacted with Wells Fargo in writing on XX/XX/XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that XXXX was still waiting on a response from Wells Fargo. I explained how long I had waited and asked for my case to be escalated. I was told there was nothing I could do to expedite it, I was just asked to wait more, even after I explained how much of a financial stressor this was for me. As a result, I was unable to get my money back in time to cover my taxes, causing me financial distress and tax penalties. I was told to give it another 90 days from the last interaction, which was on XX/XX/XXXX. The new deadline was then communicated to me as being no later than XX/XX/XXXX. I filed a police report on XX/XX/XXXX. I called the claims department again on XX/XX/XXXX. This time, I was told that the most recent interaction between XXXX and Wells Fargo was on XX/XX/XXXX, and that this date served as the new benchmark for another 60 to 90 days of waiting for a resolution on my end. This moved the new deadline for 90 days to Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. I called the XXXX Claims Department again on XX/XX/XXXX, more than 90 days after the new deadline for my case. I was told that the case was still open, but that I had to wait 120 days instead of 90 days for a resolution. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX, more than the 120 days after the extended deadline. This time they escalated my case to the executive office, and told me that they would have some sort of update in 2-5 days. It never came. I called XXXX Claims Department again on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that Wells Fargo has a backlog and to wait for an update. I was not given a timeframe, help, or any other meaningful info. I'm at a loss now because Wells Fargo keeps telling me that I need to talk to XXXX  ( my bank ), and XXXX is telling me Wells Fargo is not responding or refunding me in a timely manner. If you can help, I have a ton of documents and proof to share, including the two fraud claims I filled out, a police report, a copy of the cashed checked and the signature, and a copy of the annual business tax renewal that the original check was meant for.

XXXX XXXX, Texas XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2020 CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU To whom it may concern, I would like this document to be used as a cover letter which will explain the nature of my request to Wells Fargo Bank, as I have been instructed  to do so by my legal advisor in regards to my unresolved situation regarding a wrongfully processed transaction. The following is a description of the events that followed from the XXXX of XXXX and supporting evidence of the facts : On the XXXX of XXXX at XXXX I logged into my Wells Fargo online account and carried out an online transfer from my account number XXXX to my clients account with name XXXX XXXX XXXX sort code XXXX, account number XXXX for the sum of GBP XXXX. As I was about to complete the transfer the system took me out of the page and showed a message on screen that read Error, try again later this happened repeatedly 3 or 4 times. I never received confirmation that the transfer had successfully taken place and indicating that there had been an error in the transfer being processed. 
As instructed by the Error, try again later message at XXXX I again logged into my account and tried to carry out the transfer for the same sum, GBP XXXX to the same client account number. The transfer was successful and I received confirmation that the transfer had gone through. Attachment 1 is the print out of the confirmation I received for the successful transfer. 
At XXXX : XXXX I log into my account to carry out another transfer from my account number XXXX to my clients account with the name XXXX XXXX, with XXXX code XXXX and account number XXXX for the sum of GBP XXXX. Once the transaction had been completed and I had received the confirmation, I noticed that my account balance did not reflect the outgoing of my previous transfer of GBPXXXX only the GBPXXXX had been debited from my account. Attachment 2 is the print of the confirmation I received for the successful transfer. 
At XXXX I logged into my Wells Fargo account and I noticed that the transfer for GPB XXXX was not reflected in my account balance, even though the transfer for GPB XXXX which I conducted afterwards was applied to my balance. 
Although I found that odd, I also presumed the transfer could be delayed and the amount would appear withdrawn the next day as I had the confirmation. 
On the XXXX of XXXX at XXXX I logged into my Wells Fargo account to check my balance, expecting to have the two transfers from the XXXX of XXXX applied to my account as per confirmations received, as previously noted I saw that the confirmed transfer for GPBXXXX had been deducted from my balance, however now there were TWO transfers for GPBXXXX each, totaling GBPXXXX  being shown as pending transactions, this seemed unusual as normally a wire withdraws the funds immediately from the account. Please see Attachment 3 showing the two separate transactions. 

Transaction 1 Reference number- XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Amount in USD- {$15000.00} Transaction 2 Reference number- XXXX   XXXX, Srf & Rfb XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in USD- {$15000.00} Immediately on the XXXX of XXXX at XXXX I called the Wells Fargo online customer service line ( XXXX ). The customer service agent was a Female agent. I asked for both of the transactions to be cancelled as they were showing pending or in the worst case scenario to cancel one of the transactions for GPBXXXX as it was obvious it had been wrongfully carried out. She said that the bank would do their best to cancel the transactions and issued the following case number for future reference : Case # XXXX Please note the call lasted 56 minutes and 09 seconds. 
On the XXXX of XXXX at XXXX after not having heard from Wells Fargo for more than 48 hours, I called Wells Fargo customer service line ( XXXX ) to follow up on my case as I had not get any news in the following 48 hours of my call requesting the bank to cancel the transactions. A Female agent answered and proceeded to explain that the cancelation and reimbursement of my money could take up to 30 calendar days and dhe also told me not to worry about receiving my money back again. The call lasted 57 minutes and 13 seconds. 
On the XXXX of XXXX at XXXX XXXX I called the Wells Fargo customer service line ( XXXX ) to again follow up on my case as I had not received any update or correspondance from the bank for 10 days since my last call on the XXXX of XXXX. Again I was reassured that there would be no problem, the money would be returned to my account and was asked not to worry. I was also explained that the delay was likely due to the transaction being an international transfer and that they took longer than usual to return the money to the account. The call lasted 25 minutes and 57 seconds. 
On the XXXX of XXXX at XXXX I dialed the Wells Fargo customer service line ( XXXX ) to again follow up on my case as I did not receive any information and we are approaching the 30 calendar days since the transfers were made. I was hoping to hear an update about it. The gentleman who answered offered me to resolve the issue after I explained to him the situation, he left the call three or four times, and after he told me that there was nothing he could do to help me. The call lasted 1 hour 14 minutes and 58 seconds. 
On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I received a call from XXXX XXXX, it was a courtesy call. He is a Brokerage Advisor for Wells Fargo Bank at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Texas, XXXX, he asked how things were going with the Covid19 and was checking in on me, so I explained to him all the details of the transfers and the previous conversations with his colleagues. He offered to call the online wire transfer department on my behalf and to check in on what was going on. Unfortunately he called me back 2 hours later and told me that there was nothing new to report. 
On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I again called Wells Fargo customer service line ( XXXX ) but after 21 minutes 52 seconds I hung-up because nobody would take my call. 
On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX me a message, I have checked my online statement and only one payment of GBPXXXXXXXX is showing. This does not mean you did not send the second payment. We have an overly regulated bank system here in XXXX. If the payment is not expected against our sales ledger it gets rejected. Not the first time. 
On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I called Wells Fargo customer service line ( XXXX ) after a Female agent read my case, she tells me I did everything wrong. That I should have two different case numbers, one for each of the wires and that I should have been calling online wire transfer at Wells Fargo, and that she was going to switch me to that extension, XXXX takes the call, reads the notes on my case and transfers me to XXXX. XXXX then tells me that my case will be resolved very soon. That they are waiting for more information from the Bank in the XXXX, because all they know is that the beneficiary of the wires is not answering the bank calls. The call lasted 1 hour 02 minutes 36 seconds. 
On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I received a call from Wells Fargo Customer Care ( XXXX ) the agent name is XXXX. He told me that my case was closed because they had tried to reach me a couple times and that I did not answer their calls, I asked what phone number did they use and he gave me a number that I did not recognize, I told him so and then he tells me that he is reopening my case. He also told me that the bank from XXXX did respond to them and told them that the recipient of the wires did not answer any calls from the bank and that he had received both wires. I asked him if he could put that in writing and send it to me, he told me that was impossible to do. Later in the morning I received an email from him with the new case number. Attachment 4. 
Case # XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I received a call from XXXX XXXX from Wells Fargo Customer Fraud Detection , he gets all my information and tells me that he will be reviewing my case and gives me a new case number. 
Case # XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I received a call from XXXX ( Wells Fargo Customer Care ) the same XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX and he tells me that they are really trying to help me that he was going to send my case to Executive Resolution Office and XXXX XXXX was going to be the agent in charge of my case, he introduced me to him and we talked and he also gives me a new case number. 
Case # XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX I received a message from XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I have chased my bank this morning to locate this 2nd payment and they are useless. They still have not gotten back to me and I am in a queue waiting for the investigations team to resource the search. 
On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I received a call from XXXX XXXX ( Wells Fargo Executive Resolution Office ) he ask again about all the things that had happened and told me that they were trying very hard to help me to recover the money. At that point I started to get frustrated as I felt I was going around in circles having to explain over and over again the same things. 
On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I received a call from XXXX XXXX , after 8 minutes of going nowhere, we hung up and he called me again at XXXX and asked if I would be available to go to the Wells Fargo Bank here in XXXX XXXX XXXX sometime this week to try and resolve this problem, I told him that I would be happy to go that same day, as I am anxious to resolve this matter. He called the Bank and got me an appointment with the Branch Manager XXXX XXXX at XXXX. At XXXX we arrived at the bank and were greeted by XXXX XXXX, my daughter XXXX was with me, and asked to have the Manager there with us. She spoke on the matter and also advised we are prepared to seek Legal Counsel. It was obvious they knew nothing of what was going on and the  money is still untraceable. To be frank, it is very frustrating to waste one 's time and not be prepared to discuss the matter at hand. The only thing they could offer was to contact the Executive Office again, therefore another complaint was filled. Attachment 5. 
On XXXX the XXXX Early in the morning I received an email from Wells Fargo Complaints Executive Office with a new case number. Attachment 6. 
Case # XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX We received a call from Wells Fargo Complaints Executive Office , the agent is XXXX XXXX He was condescending and going around in circles telling us that the Bank in XXXX can not force their client to return the money and that I am responsible for all this, because it was my mistake for sending those two wires. Does he really think I did this on purpose? It was WELLS FARGOS COMPUTER GLITCH that caused all this chaos and should have been stopped while the transaction was on pending. 
On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I received a call from XXXX on my cell, he was really trying to force me to accept the responsibilities for this case stating that the amounts in USD are different, he kept forcing the matter on me to accept responsability. This is absurd, I sent GBPXXXX. and he can not say otherwise. He also told me that the reason the bank did not inquire on the two pending  wires, was because the dollar amounts were different. I repeatedly explained I did not do the wire transfer in Dollars, your system gives you the ability to input the currency that you want your wire to be sent in this is not my first or last foreign wire transfer that I have completed. 
It is evident from the description of events leading to my plea to review my case that the nature of the issue was a transaction that was wrongfully processed by the bank, without a confirmation being issued to me. My client with the name XXXX XXXX sort code XXXX and account number XXXX has confirmed to me that he only received GPBXXXX. into his account. 
I would like to ask for your support to look into the matter and resolve the issue, as the sum is quite substantial ( GBP XXXX ) and from the facts described above you can see that the transaction was wrongfully processed as no confirmation was issued to me, instead a system error notice asking me to try again later appeared on the screen, which is what I did. This all happened in a span of 10 minutes, and I immediately the next day gave instructions to the bank to cancel the transactions while pending. 
I look forward to hearing from you and appreciate your assistance in this matter. 
Best regards, XXXX President"
1039,On XX/XX/2019 I XXXX XXXX attempted to purchased 4 concert tickets from a person named XXXX XXXX for {$120.00} from which I saw she was selling on XXXX. Reference # XXXX They had stated they preferred to use the app XXXX for payment. I was not familiar with this app however I saw it was linked with the bank I already use Wells Fargo. I went ahead and set up the transfer. This person then sent me another request for the same amount {$120.00} a 2nd time and never sending the tickets via email because according to them the first one did not go through. I immediately felt suspicious and called Wells Fargo to cancel the transaction however it was already completed and the only thing left for me to do was to file a claim ( claim # XXXX XXXX which I did then do. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that the online transfer was already approved and processed and there was nothing left I could do. They can not reverse the transfer. Now I am out {$120.00} and zero concert tickets. I only used the XXXX app because it was affiliated with Wells Fargo and trusted that using my back to transfer funds would come with some sort of back up. I guess I was wrong. How is the app still being used?
1042,Received a call from someone acting as Wells fargo. They had me transfer funds XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX and the amount of {$3500.00} as a way to keep them from being removed from my account. Wells Fargo says the funds can not be recovered and there's nothing they can do
1044,Wells Fargo bank in XXXX tx .. date XX/XX/19 time XXXX : XXXX transaction # XXXX teller : : XXXX accepted a money order for XXXX $ $ from XXXX. food store that is 50 yards away.. the teller said that by 48hours for sure. The money would be available for spending by the account holder.. that never happened..then on XX/XX/19 .. the money order was cashed ... XXXX   XXXX  money order department.. vertify this in a phone conversation..they claim the money was being held for vertification ... .up to this day they have not done their job duty function of care to a client.
1045,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call from someone pretending to be a Wells Fargo employee stating that they were calling because my account had been flagged for attempted charges in XXXX Fl, I reside in XXXX XXXX, NV. They said charges had been attempted at XXXX XXXX for {$500.00} and XXXX and a transfer thru XXXX for {$1000.00} The inbound phone number was a valid WF #, I know the number at a glance because I have been banking with them since XXXX. The caller used all the correct verbiage a bank employee would use so I had no reason not to believe I was on the phone with the bank employee. They said they had to cancel my debit card and issue a new one but in order to do so they needed information from me. I gave them my card # and they claimed to do the transaction to issue a new card, they said I would get a follow up within 24hrs. 
I waited but no call came, no new debit card arrived in the mail and upon looking at my account I noticied a {$1000.00} debit to my account thru XXXX sent to XXXX XXXX, no phone number was indicated.. 
I filed a claim which was denied, I made an appointment to see a banker, she said the claim said it appeared as though I transferred the money to myself. That makes absolutely no sense. She said I did nothing wrong and that I would get my money back. So she opened a 2nd claim. 
That claim was also denied, now Wells Fargo is claiming that I authorized this transfer, when in fact I did not. So first I transferred the money to myself, then I authorized the transfer to someone named XXXX XXXX, whom I do not know. 
I met with yet another banker at a different branch to see if I could get my claim reopened or escalated, again she's is looking at my account and says "" Something seems off ''. I agree. 
They will not reimburse me for the {$1000.00} transfer and I know for a fact there were other victim of this same scam in California who did get reimbursed. Wells Fargo will not take any responsibility for protecting their customers from situations just like this. 
I feel like a victim that is not being heard and hope you can help me resolve this. 
I still bank with Wells Fargo even after dealing with this for the last 6 months but {$1000.00} is a great deal of money for someone on a fixed income and they just don't seem to care. I have exhausted my options with WF so I am turning to you to try and make this right. 
I will provide the documentation I have but feel free to contact me if you need further docs. 
Thank You. 
Respectfully yours, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"
1046,"I spent 4 months setting aside money to buy my family a new bengal kitten for the mental health of one I already own. 

I ran into XXXX and contacted them. I did some minor checking ( though not enough clearly ), and they seemed legit. All their initial info was what you would expect of a typical and experienced Bengal breeder. The website listed multiple names of people claimed to be involved. Phone numbers that appear to actually be located in the area they claim to be. The hours they communicated with me were typical of the east coast. And they send you a contract to digitally sign that included their physical location as well, which matched up with the area code of the phone numbers given. 

I was asked to send payment through XXXX on my bank app. I have never used it before, but given that XXXX was a feature built in to the application of my bank I believed it would be a safer function to use as opposed a third party application. 
I sent them the initial cost of {$660.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and they said the next day the kitten would be shipped to me for pickup at the airport. 

Next day came ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and I receive an email that there is a problem, and that regulations had changed, and kittens under 5 months old can only use certain crates, and additional pet insurance fee. It would cost me {$380.00} for the crate, which if I returned the crate on pickup they would return {$350.00} to me, and {$120.00} for the insurance. I attempted to call the listed contacts, the first number did not work, and the second number went to voice mail with multiple attempts. 
I asked if I could simply drive to pick up the cat since Im 90 minutes away. They said the arrangement for the air transfer was already set and it would cost money to change it now anyway. 
Given their business was in selling kittens and they didnt already know this stuff, I immediately decided this was not legit, and called the bank to dispute the first payment. Wells Fargo informed me XXXX is more for people I trust rather than a payment system ( this warning was not listed in the application before payment was sent ). And Wells Fargo stated they can file a dispute, but I likely wont get my money back because it was up to XXXX to decide the outcome. 

So Wells Fargo filed the dispute, and I then immediately went to the local police at XXXX, Ct. I spoke to an officer and handed him all the information I had at the time ( emails, images, signed contract ). The office called one of the phone numbers given. And the person picked up. The name on the site and contract was XXXX and the payment on XXXX went to an account named XXXX XXXX. But a man with an XXXX accent picked up claiming to be XXXX husband. 

The officer pretended to be an interested buyer by asking various questions about several kittens. And when the office mentioned the one I bought the person said that kitten wasnt available, and that it was paid for on the previous day. He also mentioned the buyer might have changed his mind due to new shipping costs, so he could check back in a few days to see if the kitten became available. 
The officer then tried to offer more money for the kitten I purchased and the person declined. 

Both I and the officer agreed that the answers given by the person on the phone made the business appear to be legitimate. So after leaving the officer I called the person back and said I would pay the surprise fee. I asked why these new charges were surprise, and was then informed by the man on the phone it was a new regulation with the shipping agency they used. I asked other questions such as which airport the pet is coming from and was told XXXX, as well as if it was possible I could speak to the shipping agent. But was told it would not be possible at this time. I did not like I was not able to confirm any of the information with anyone, and voiced my concerns, to which the person apologized for. But given that I already had {$660.00} in this purchase, and he told what he believed to be another potential buyer my cat was no longer available, I went ahead and attempted to send the person the total of the new cost. 

When I attempted to transfer the money, XXXX said I could not send the full amount due to a 24 hour transfer limit, and was only able to send a partial amount of {$330.00}. So I sent that on XX/XX/XXXX and said I can send the rest the next day. After this, the person emailed with me for a while about things such as the best time to have the kitten arrive on my end to pick flight times. 

Next morning came ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I had to do the rest of the payment. But before this I had a friend of mine call and attempt to buy two kittens because he lives in MA, 40 minutes from their claimed location. As a pet owner he was able to ask a lot of questions and the person I was speaking to was able to give my friend all the answers he expected of a breeder. He asked for two snow bengal kittens, a male listed, and the female I paid for. When the call first started my friend was told all the cats on the page were available. But when my cat was mentioned by name, again the person said that animal was already taken and paid for. 
My friend asked he asked if could stop by to see the kittens, but he was told no because of Covid. Then when they talked about the shipping my friend said he can simply pick up the animal because of distance, and the person hung up the phone on him. 

So at this point the person I gave the money to had me, my friend, 4 co-workers, and a police officer believing the sale was probably legitimate, but not without some reservations due to weird behavior. 

So on XX/XX/XXXX I sent in the last of the payment ( {$170.00} ), and then I received an email reply saying he will hurry with the final steps and get back to me shortly with the transport details. 
Then 5 hours later it was time for me to leave work to start going to the airport. I attempted call several times and only got to voice mail. When I got into my car to leave from work I called once more, and was given an immediate automatic message that the number was no longer in service! And my gmail was not able to send any more replies. 
I then attempted to call with a different phone, and the call went through to the voice mail, confirming my phone number was blocked. 

After this I then returned to the XXXX, Ct police station and spoke with a different officer. I provided the updates to the case. The officer informed me that it is still possible the sale was legitimate, and a possibility that I could simply be experiencing poor customer service, and asked me to be patient to see what happens. 

Today is XX/XX/XXXX and I have not heard anything from the people I sent the money to. I have called Wells Fargo to follow up on my claim numbers, and they state all 3 cases are closed, and that they sent a request to XXXX for a refund of the money. I then called XXXX, and they say they will not protect buyers and that it is up to the bank to refund my money. And they also outright told me the scammer is going to get away with it.

1047,"On XX/XX/XXXX ... our Wells Fargo Checking account was hacked ... and $ XXXX dollars were wired out of the account. Wells Fargo was notified within 20 minutes of this happening ... while they said they would do everything to recall the wire ... they did not. 

When I complained and asked why they did not ask us to confirm the wire ... they said that they texted my wife ... which they did not. 

I escalated all the way to what I was told was the "" highest level of customer complaints '' the rep was XXXX XXXX ... to which she replied that they would do nothing ... and could not provide any record or confirmation of the text being sent or us approving the transaction. I was just supposed to take it on their word ... which is amazing to me. 

I asked her if she had the authority to change that decision to which she replied that she did not ... so I suggested she was NOT the highest level of consideration ... since she was not able to change it. We are out {$4700.00} ... and Wells did nothing to help and nothing in taking any responsibility for protecting the integrity of their customer 's money."
1052,"I was a victim of fraud through a phone call scam. The scammer asked me to send money through XXXX. After the money was sent, I realized that this was a scam and I called Wells Fargo immediately to inform them. I also filed a police report with the XXXX XXXX police department. I have filed a few claims with Wells Fargo since they are declining to refund the money to me. I also have a letter from the Attorney General stating that my situation was a fraudulent scam. Before I get lawyers involved and go to small claims court, I am submitting another complaint that includes actual verbiage from the EFTA as to why I am protected as the consumer and why Wells Fargo needs to refund the money in order to oblige by the FDIC and EFTA. Here are a few exerpts that I have copied and pasted regarding "" unauthorized '' transactions and what that is defined as. There is an argument based on the plain language of Regulation E that since the consumer has "" furnished the access device '' to the third party, the transaction may not qualify as an unauthorized EFT. However, the official interpretation of Regulation E provides the contrary answeran unauthorized EFT includes any transfer initiated by a person who obtained an access device through fraud, robbery, or force. My situation falls under fraud! Wells Fargo tried to also say that I could have called the sheriff 's department to verify the information that was being given to me. I said, "" the phone call came from the police department and the person told me his name and I googled and it was in fact the name of a XXXX XXXX sheriff, so why would I call them if I think I am on the phone with them ''? Not to mention, it is actually illegal for Wells Fargo to say that I should have done something like that!! The CFPB made clear that a consumer is entitled to receive the liability protections of Regulation E, even if that consumer acted negligently. The EFTA is regulated and enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). This US government agency has made it clear that when scammers access accounts by fraud or robbery, the resulting transactions fall into the unauthorized category. The CFPA confirmed that the EFTA protects consumers who have been swindled and the Act requires investigation and reimbursement according to its terms. When a consumer is tricked or manipulated into allowing access to their account, all related transfers are considered unauthorized."
1054,"On Tuesday XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo called me to say that someone had just tried to transfer {$2500.00} with XXXX from my online account. I had not done this transaction. I went to my local bank, but they were not able to help me get my money back. I filed the complaint with Wells Fargo. They said I had to wait 10 days to see if I would get my money back. I have bills to pay, like my house and utilities. I want my {$2500.00} back."
1057,"On Monday XX/XX/2021, I received a text message alerting me about an attempt of Wells Fargo XXXX transfer for the amount of {$3000.00} it was asking me to reply yes or no. Before I was able to reply I had an incoming phone call from Wells Fargo 's customer service phone number, the number that is on the back of my debit card, I verified that before I answered. Being sure it was Wells Fargo I answered, then the person said he was from Wells Fargo 's Fraud Department and explained there was a money transfer for {$2000.00} and another for {$1000.00} and a purchase at a XXXX in Florida using my debit card number which he provided, and asked if I had done the transactions, I quickly said no. Then he said they were processing and in order to reverse the transactions I had to send the money back to myself, he guided me to add my First and Last name and phone number, I did. This person knew my address which is where he said I would receive a new debit card. He knew my full name, account number, my phone number, the last 4 of my social security number, and my debit card numbers. He sent me a code to my phone and asked to say it back to him, and I did. He also said the fraudster with the name of XXXX had tried changing my online banking password twice. After guiding me to reverse my money back into my account he said I would receive my new debit card in 5-7 business days, and my money would appear in about 24 hours but some cases could take up to 72 hours and that he would call me back in three days to have me updated. He didn't call back, so that day on XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo and asked to get an update on what was going on, then that was were they told me that they didn't see any fraudbnotes of any kind and had me explain what had happened then the lady said that was scam, but I explained it wasn't because it was wells Fargos phone number then she said scammers now do something where they fake the caller id. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. they transferred me to fraud dept. they took my report, and said it would take 10 days to resolve. I called on day 5 and they said it was still in progress, but they would have an answer by XX/XX/XXXX without counting XXXX day. I then called XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX pm and they said it was still in progress I explained to her, someone had told me it would be ready by XX/XX/XXXX, she said that it depends on the time of day I reported this. If I had reported in the afternoon then that day wouldn't count, I reported around XXXX.She said it should be done by the next day Friday. So I called on Saturday and she told me the case was closed and that wells fargo had sent me a letter. She read me the letter saying I had authorized the transaction or someone with my username and password authorized the transaction. If I had question I should contact fraud dept. phone number. I did contact them I asked the woman I wanted to know where my money had ended up, if I had sent the money to me, and on my statement that's what it appears. and for XXXX 's process to send money you type in the persons name, last name, and phone number. she read my claim report out loud then I asked her where my money had ended then she said it had ended in a different account and she asked me if I had received any information on the account I was sending to while sending my money, and of course I did not, she then asked me if I was reimbursed my money, I said no. When she said my money ended up in a different account I asked her well can't Wells Fargo investigate that other account and see who's account that is a solve this and she said well yes and she then said needed a few minutes to read the notes on the investigation again. Throughout the whole phone call she seemed very confused and didn't know what to say. after reading the notes she said I had authorized the transactions I said yes but federal law under regulation e protected me in this type of fraud she said the banks don't see this as fraud, and that banks focus on some stuff to tell whether it was fraud or not. I asked her what did consider fraud and she said she couldn't tell me I then told her it was fraud indeed because I was tricked by someone impersonating wells fargo to send my money and I didn't authorize the transactions to a stranger I authorized them to myself. I mentioned cfpb saw this as fraud because I was induced to send my money then there was a very long 30 second silence from her part then she just said I understand after that I was able to hear her typing on the computer for 5 seconds and then she hung up on me. she didn't try calling back so I called again and the person who answered said the case was denied and there was no way to consider the case anymore, I asked to be transferred to a manager, or supervisor to explain the situation and he said there was nothing to be done anymore and the only thing he was able to do was send me a written documentation of the case. Banks need to adjust what they consider fraud because it seems like fraudsters know what banks consider fraud and what they will NOT INVESTIGATE. for fraudsters its as easy as tricking customers like me and sending our money into another account right in front of bank 's eyes and get away with this because of the big door banks have open for them. Wells Fargo did send me a letter thanking me for reporting my checks lost or stolen, that was clearly not what I reported. I don't own checks, and my statements are delivered via online."

As soon as I received the notification, I immediately called Wells Fargo 's Fraud/Online ACH department to report the unauthorized transaction. The representative began a claim on my behalf, and after the case was processed the results indicated that there was no suspicious evidence to report. The financial institution claimed that I received a confirmation code to approve the transaction, but I never did. I requested official cellular data transcripts from my cell phone provider to further prove I did not receive that message but I need a lawyer and/or subpoena to acquire those documents."
1059,"Cashing a check issued by a company through Wells Fargo has exposed a fraudulent practice by Wells Fargo. I was asked to provide 2 forms of ideas, my driver license and XXXX XXXX XXXX card was provided, then the teller asked me to place my thumb print on the check.

She refused to cash my check, then asked for her manager to speak to me. Spoke to her manager ( XXXX XXXX XXXX /Service manager ) she also refuse to cash their check without my thumb print, then said "" maybe you should go to your XXXX XXXX  XXXX to cash all your checks '' I perceived her commend as a total disrespect. I then spoke to the branch manager  ( XXXX XXXX ), once again I was refused to cash their check without thumb print. It is my understanding and through the Consumer finance web site, there is no law permitting any bank institution to demand any citizen to provide finger prints in order to cash a check. This would be a direct violation of my privacy right. I will pursue this issue all the way to our land 's supreme court if need be, and see it being correct to where no financial institution is permitted to demand citizens of this land to provide their finger prints just to cash a check."

1069,"We are two retired XXXX, XXXX & XXXX XXXX, who have had our own charitable project working with 1500 families of XXXX patients in XXXX XXXX since XXXX, through XXXX XXXX XXXX, a nonprofit organization registered with the IRS. We use mostly our savings, with help through small fund raising events and from our family. My sister, XXXX XXXX, an XXXX XXXX XXXX, donated the total of {$20000.00} to our cause through 4 checks of {$5000.00} each. The checks were payable to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. We received 2 checks ( 1st and 4th ), but were away for a short trip between XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. When came back, we found no mail in our curbside mail box, which was odd! We also were waiting for a debit card from Wells Fargo Bank, which we never used it except for access to our Wells Fargo ATM machine. 
On Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX, my sister received a voice mail from a lady named XXXX, from Fraud Prevention Office of Wells Fargo. She asked if XXXX XXXX wrote 2 checks to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, as someone was attempting to cash them at a Wells Fargo Branch. We told her I never cashed any check ( including the one I  had received ) yet, and requested to cancel the checks ASAP. Just a few minutes later, she called back and said they checks were cashed. My sister issued the checka from her XXXX XXXX XXXX. I incidentally happen to be a Wells Fargo client as well. I immediately notified the police of XXXX XXXX County where I live, spoke to Officer XXXX XXXX, case # XXXX on the same day, XX/XX/XXXX. 

These are the problems we have with Wells Fargo : - They clearly made a mistake to notify us ONLY AFTER checks were cashed for "" suspicious activities ''. The person who signed in the back of the checks identified himself as XXXX XXXX, endorsing to himself posing as "" XXXX XXXX '', left with {$10000.00}. On the upper left corner of the check is the clear sentence : "" Please post to XXXX XXXX ''. 
-The lady XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX at Wells Fargo who notified us, refused to give us ( myself and my sister XXXX her whole name or title. She refused to give me the exact location of the branch and time stamp when checks were cashed, to provide to officer XXXX as instructed by him, claiming she had to protect the privacy of Mr. XXXX. The best she could do was reading out the signatures on the back of the checks as XXXX XXXX. It was very hard to contact her, even offer XXXX had the same problem. We would mostly run into her recorded message with first and last name hard to decipher. 
-She told us to call "" Legal Enforcement '' number at ( XXXX ) XXXX, who in turn told us they only take care of bank robberies or bank alarm system, and who told us to speak to Customer Services of Wells Fargo . We were passed around like hot potato! 
-I spoke to XXXX XXXX at Customer Care , Executive Office : ( XXXX ) XXXX, who told me he could not release the exact location where the checks were cashed or time stamped "" to protect the privacy of XXXX XXXX '', just like XXXX had said. He demanded my sister XXXX XXXX ( who was giving me {$20000.00} for XXXX XXXX   and who issued the checks ) to establish a claim with her XXXX XXXX XXXX, to get the compensation from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
-My sister is setting up a claim with XXXX XXXX XXXX , although clearly the fault was with Wells Fargo in the first place. 
- On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo informed us that our Debit Card was being used at XXXX XXXX, at XXXX and XXXX. He was declined at XXXX, but at XXXX he got away with {$440.00}. Again, we have no idea how he could activate a stolen card from a mail box. We set up another claim and expected us not being responsible for {$440.00}. 
We have been customers of Wells Fargo for more than 30 years. How they handled the case was heartless, irresponsible and lack of empathy. We feel abandoned after the mistake they made. We will fight for the sake of 1,500 families of patients of XXXX, who are still waiting for the money."

I did and they offered to put {$500.00} in my checking account ( which they already had access to, unknown to me ) so I agreed out of fear because that account had a lot of money in it due to a recent property sale.They put a screen on my computer called XXXX XXXX and told me to enter {$500.00}. When I did it changed to {$50000.00} and the decimal point disappeared.They acted very upset and said I needed to return the money, directed me how so I did believing I had someone else 's money.What followed was an offer to give me {$2000.00} for my trouble and send a wire transfer to XXXX for {$48000.00}. I was given all the name & banking information to do the transfer so I went to my bank, Wells Fargo, to obtain the wire transfer. My main issue is their knowledge of the bank account number without me telling them ; they said I opened a XXXX account with it XXXX, which I did not. I have filed a local police report, filed a wire transfer claim with Wells Fargo and was told it's too late, I notified XXXX as their logo was at the top of the email & I obtained legal advice."
1073,"XXXX XXXX an employee of XXXX XXXX told me he was the inventory manager for the southeast and wanted to thank me for taking care of him.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I withdrew {$800.00} from my bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX by debit card and went to XXXX and got a money order. He gave me his Wells Fargo bank account information and I deposited the money. Then, he informs me the money wont clear until Tuesday. So he got {$750.00} from me in cash that I again withdrew by debit card. He took it and went to XXXX to deliver my items. After two days and so many deliveries from XXXX XXXX XXXX he promised me it would happen. On Tuesday, XX/XX/19 he said they attempted to deliver but no one answered the door.

But that he would return {$1800.00} to me in XXXX XXXX gift cards and go to the store with me to change them into cash. I didnt know they dont do this. So on Friday XX/XX/19 I again withdrew {$1000.00} from An atm at XXXX and went inside and got a money order. I then went to Wells Fargo and deposited the money into his Wells Fargo account. He said if the money clears delivery will be Friday. The money didnt clear til Saturday. I was talking to him on the phone as he was driving to the XXXX  XXXX XXXX store. He said I am getting pulled over. Cops are coming. I literally never heard from him again until XXXX that afternoon when I received text messages from his number. The mystery person told me he was in jail. I repeatedly asked for my {$2500.00} back. They told me no. I said Im going to the police. They said try to make a case. Anyways I have been lied to. There were no goods delivered ever. I want my XXXX money back. Please help!!! I have proof of the deposits and withdrawals from my bank."

That I didn't have to worry wellsfargo was going to refund me my lost money {$1600.00} then wellsfargo called me and told that they can't do nothing to refund me that money because they don't have the power to do it so, Even they said about that APP fraud was a scam. I called them to say that I have 10 yeas with them and I didn't have a problem like that before but I could see that they didn't know what they were doing about it. This is the case number # XXXX"
1078,"On XX/XX/2020, after closing on a land sale, my title company wired the proceeds of my sale in the amount of {$140000.00} to Wells Fargo to be applied to my mortgage account. This amount would leave a loan balance on my mortgage of approximately {$1000.00}. Unfortunately, the title company made an error when wiring the funds. In the position that was meant for Wells Fargos account number, the title company account manager entered my loan number in its place. However, rather than Wells Fargo acknowledging the error and rejecting the transaction, they accepted the wire transfer and subsequently placed the funds into a different clients account stating that client had the same account number within a different department of Wells Fargo banking outside of the mortgage department. 
Realizing the funds had not been deposited into my account within the first 24 hours, I contacted Wells Fargo Customer Service and was told it could take up to 48 hours to post. After 48 hours had passed and without any credit to my account, I contacted customer service once again and was told I needed to contact the bank that wired the funds XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. It was at this point, XXXX XXXX XXXX  realized an error had been made by the title company when they initiated the wire transfer. XXXX XXXX XXXX   immediately requested thru the FED that Wells Fargo return the funds. Wells Fargo then admitted they had placed the funds into the wrong account and they needed ten days to correct the error. Unsatisfied with their response, I filed a case with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in an attempt to retrieve the funds.

I was soon contacted by a Wells Fargo representative stating he was going to be handling the CFPB case, and that he would keep me well informed and remain very transparent during the process. A week later, he passed the case over to another representative stating he was leaving on vacation. As I waited for Wells Fargo to retrieve the funds while enduring many sleepless nights and stressful days, I paid down the remaining balance of my mortgage account leaving a balance in the exact amount of the missing $ XXXX. This was my only recourse at the time, as Wells Fargo seemed in no hurry to assist me or keep me informed of their progress. 
In the end, it took Wells Fargo until XX/XX/XXXX to return the funds to XXXX XXXX XXXX  who in turn returned the funds to the title company. Nearly an entire month had gone by. I received a check for the $ XXXX and deposited the check into my Wells Fargo savings account with the intention of performing an ACH transfer to my mortgage account once the check cleared. The bank manager from the XXXX, WA branch offered to perform the exchange for me. However, having zero faith or trust in Wells Fargo following the wire transfer issue, I declined her assistance and performed the ACH transfer myself sending Wells Fargo Mortgage {$140000.00} leaving a mortgage balance of approximately {$47.00}. Once the funds were applied, I would then move forward with the Payoff process. Within 48 hours of the {$140000.00} being transferred, my statement showed that Wells Fargo only applied {$48.00}, XXXX to my mortgage account and placed {$99000.00} into a Funds Not Applied account. I immediately contacted Customer Service regarding the transfer and was told I had sent more than the payoff amount causing the transfer to be split and not fully applied due to an improper payoff attempt. It took Wells Fargo another week to apply the full amount to my mortgage account and they finally explained the funds were not applied because there was a {$100.00}, XXXX limit on ACH transfers, even though the Bank Manager offered to make the transfer of $ XXXX for me. 
From my initial attempt to wire money to my mortgage account on XX/XX/2020 until the funds were finally applied to my mortgage account on XX/XX/2020 was 42 days. During this time, I made a full payment on XX/XX/XXXX resulting in an interest payment of nearly {$500.00}. Interest on the account continued to accrue. When Wells Fargo finally applied the funds to my mortgage account on XX/XX/XXXX, there was a shortage due to fees and interest, and they depleted my Escrow account to make up the difference. As well, they stated I was still an additional {$180.00} short of the payoff amount that they went ahead and paid for me. They demanded I pay the {$180.00} back to them, and against my better judgement, I mailed the payment to prevent them from tying up the deed to my property. 
A Wells Fargo agent contacted me on XX/XX/XXXX to discuss XXXX XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau response. He told me they were not accepting any responsibility for the incidents. I told him I never did believe there was ever another Wells Fargo client with the same exact account number as mine, and he admitted the account number the $ XXXX was wired into was not the same as mine, but only similar. I explained to him that I did not agree with Wells Fargos decision. 
On XX/XX/2020, Wells Fargo responded in writing to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau complaint and accepted zero responsibility for the incident. They accepted zero responsibility for my money being placed into another customers account. They did not admit a complete lack of oversight during the wiring process, and that the funds were not matched to any account by name as required by Federal law. They accepted zero responsibility for it taking 42 days for the funds to be applied to my mortgage. They continued to charge me interest and fees during the 42 days stating the situation was solely due to the title companys error. They were not transparent during the process, regularly refused to accept or return my calls and messages, and made several different excuses as to why the money was missing, deposited improperly, not immediately returned, and placed into a Funds not Applied account following the ACH transfer. I asked them for a comprehensive review of all fees and charges from XX/XX/XXXX until the present time, and they have not provided me with one. 
Despite the initial error by the title company, I am demanding Wells Fargo accept responsibility for their egregious errors while accepting the erroneous wire transfer, placing my money into the account of another client, and then taking 42 days to correct the problem all while continuing to charge me fees and interest. As well, their customer support during the process was absolutely terrible. I should be reimbursed any and all fees and/or charges related to the account from the date of XX/XX/2020 until the account was paid in full on XX/XX/2020."

1081,"On XX/XX/XXXX I sent {$500.00} through XXXX using my Wells Fargo checking account to someone that was supposed to send me TV speakers. I did some research on the number I was speaking with after I submitted the transfer and noticed a few web pages pop up saying they were scammed by the same phone number for different items. I immediately called Wells Fargo to report the scam and they said there was nothing they could do since I authorized the transfer. I also reached out to the scammer but of course they did not answer any of my calls or texts. I filed a police report the same day I submitted the claim to Wells Fargo just in case Wells Fargo needed it for their investigation but they never asked for any of that information. The bank said they would open an investigation and I was sent a letter a couple of weeks later saying that there is nothing they could do and that I should reach out to the scammer to ask for my money back ( great advice Wells Fargo ). I called Wells Fargo again today, XX/XX/XXXX to see if I had any other options or if they were able to use the information ( name and phone number ) provided to me for the XXXX transaction to possibly get in touch with their bank but Wells said they do not go that far and again recommended I reach out to the scammer for my money back."

Wells Fargo immediately closed all of my online access and closed the checking account. 3 days later I called to see the status and was issued a new checking account number. They told me they would be investigating the transfer. 

On XX/XX/22 I received a letter stating they finished their investigation and the claim has been closed. No reimbursement to my account was made. Follow receiving this letter, I called the claims center and spoke with XXXX from Wells Fargo, he would not give his ID number. After 30 minutes of getting no where, I asked to speak with his manager. I was put on hold for 15minutes. And was told he couldnt transfer me, but would transfer me to resolution dept. After 15minutes of holding, the line discounted. I call a gain, and then spoke with XXXX # XXXX from Wells Fargo. After she reviewed my claim, I was told to submit an incident report or police report. I explained that I have no documentation, except what I have already explained to them. I have no such documentation to prove it was not me who did this online transaction. I have no information to file a police report."

1096,"I have personally banked with Wells Fargo for 30+ years. I also have 3 businesses with more than $ 15million in annual transactions flowing through Wells. 

They have decided to endorse XXXX for web transfer of funds On XX/XX/2017, my wife identified some tickets she would like to a football game. I connected with the seller and asked them if we could see the tickets. They mentioned that they use XXXX from Wells Fargo which has fraud protection. 

Checked with Wells and yes ... they do approve XXXX. I was told that there is a delay before funds are actually transferred to ensure it is not fraud. We transferred and asked for the tracking number. The seller did not provide the tracking number so I reached out to Wells Fargo and XXXX immediately to block the transaction. There were no return calls or emails from XXXX and Wells customer service knew NOTHING about XXXX. They could not help me at all. Days went by and the Wells or XXXX did nothing. The cash was transferred after 48 hours of absolutely NO help or fraud actions from Wells Fargo or XXXX. 

Bottom line. Wells is doing NOTHING to protect long-time customers from this type of fraud. I reached all the way up to executive VPs at Wells and got absolutely nothing. Even after my 30+ years of loyalty as wells as moving my businesses to Wells . 

It is clear the direction I should take my personal and corporate banking. XXXX should be shut down."
1099,"Wells Fargo implemented a new policy that prevents anyone from exchanging foreign currency at their branches without having an account with them. 

In the past it used to be possible to go into the branch and exchange currency for a fee with proof of I.D . This is no where indicated on their website and customer service has been unhelpful, this makes it impossible to exchange money in the entire State of Alaska since they are the only major institution in the state that can do any kind of foreign exchange. 

I wanted to exchange a XXXX Peso bill back to USD that was acquired on vacation. All WF branches refuse to help or even explain the reason why this policy is in place, there is no other means to get my money back unless I open an account with WF. 

This policy is not only misleading, it forces you to open a product with them that allows a monthly service fee to accrue."

1101,"On XX/XX/2018 I was defrauded by 3 impersonators in "" the Grandma Scam '' and was asked to submit bail {$6300.00} to an account held by Wells Fargo Bank. In one of my many follow-up steps I contacted Wells Fargo with the name of the president of the Bondsman company ( to whom I sent the wired money ), the number of his bank account and the wire routing number. The first call to Wells Fargo -- about their having an account used for fraud/embezzlement/ identity theft -- got the answer "" if YOU don't have an account here, we can't help you. '' A second call to Wells Fargo, also customer service, resulted in her telling me 5-6 times we can't tell you who owns that account!! I wasn't asking that but I kept telling her I was reporting illegal activity using their account. I wanted to know what precautions they took to verify the identity of someone opening a Wells Fargo account. Above all, I wanted Wells Fargo to pursue the fraudulent activity. The only answer was we'll follow the bank protocol. 

The Name of the account owner, according to the fraudulent Bondsman, was XXXX XXXX. And his account was XXXX and the routing number was XXXX. I had my broker sell {$6300.00} from my stock portfolio and wire it to the Wells Fargo Bank. I had previously asked the Bondsman on the phone for the bank 's address but he just said it was a XXXX branch. 

The scam had 3 actors. The first was "" my son '' -- though the call began with "" Grandma? '' Since I'd been pressing my son to phone on family business and since he is also the father of baby, I thought at first he was returning my call and and pretending, as he frequently does, that the baby wants to talk to me. The rest of the call related to his car crash, his injuries, the charges for XXXX, the need for bail and asked me -- when I inquired why haven't you called you wife -- he said I want to explain it to her myself and they allowed me only one call. I thought he knew as a retiree I could easily handle the paper work and make bail fast. 

The second actor, "" the attorney for my son '' identified himself as XXXX XXXX, the court-appointed lawyer at XXXX County Courthouse in XXXX, NJ, phoning from his cell phone XXXX. The bondsman at XXXX County Courthouse was XXXX XXXX, XXXX, of XXXX and Sons, one of many bond-serving companies that serve the Courthouse on a rotating schedule.He was not the one receiving the money as the account was in the name of president of his company. 

I phoned back both of these numbers -- lawyer and bondsman -- several times in the day and in the case of my "" Son '' and his "" lawyer '' I captured -- and saved the phone calls on the monitor of my "" Caption Call '' phone. I know that my phone delete saved calls after a while -- but am too tech-phobic to fiddle around and see if there is a "" save permanently '' option. There are just erase options that I see. 

My interactions ranged with the identity thieves ran from probably XXXX XXXX to around XXXX XXXX. In that interval, my husband arrived and we discussed driving to XXXX to pick up my son when the money cleared and when he was released. A last phone call from the lawyer came and I asked what the address in XXXX was so we could plan XXXXhe drive -- the street and number didn't exist, then I asked why his phone was a XXXX area code. Meanwhile my husband called XXXX Country Courthouse and we determined it was a scam. We phoned my broker first who stopped the wire transfer, so I lost no money. 

But a crime was committed. I filed charges with local police, spoke with my Attorney General 's office, filed in both a phone call and online with the FTC, in that case and in this, bringing charges against WELLS FARGO for harboring illegal activity through their bank account number XXXX."
1103,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was scammed by an individual using XXXX through Wells Fargo. After fake emails/texts that were manipulated, we transferred {$300.00} to the scammer in order to complete the transactions ( which we were supposed to received {$300.00} ). Once I realized it was a scam and the money had been sent, I immediately tried to call XXXX to cancel the transaction but they said I had to go through Wells Fargo. So I immediately called XXXX and explained the situation, of which they opened a claim. Please know, as I was talking to the Wells Fargo agent, I still had the scammer on a text conversation. I tried to get XXXX and Wells Fargo to immediately trace/stop the transaction as well as block the receiving account, email address and phone number. Had someone looked into the email and phone number at that moment, this scammer could have been caught/flagged/punished. Instead NO ONE COULD DO ANYTHING and according to Wells Fargo, this is an "" authorized transaction '' so they all wipe their hands free of the fraudulent activity. 

HOWEVER, Per the CFPB this transaction, even if negligent, IS NOT AUTHORIZED AND SUBJECT TO REIMBURSEMENT BY WELLS FARGO! Here is the exact language taken from CFPB specifically addressing my issue : "" If you've been scammed with XXXX, you should contact your bank and report the loss of funds as soon as possible. Some banks reportedly have refused to offer refunds because the federal law protecting consumers from the theft of their funds applies only to "" unauthorized '' transactions. In XX/XX/XXXX, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued guidance to clarify that fraudulent XXXX transactions are considered unauthorized because they were initiated by someone other than the consumer and the consumer received no benefit. The CFPB also stated that banks can not consider consumer negligence as a factor or claim that consumers waived their protections in their bank account agreement. If you've been scammed with XXXX and your bank refuses to return your funds, you can file a complaint with the CFPB, which forwards consumers ' complaints to financial institutions to respond.

I called Wells Fargo Fraud Department from my XXXX local branch. 
I was explained that they noticed something was off and opened up a fraud case however didnt not stop the wire. The lady also mentioned there had been another fraud on the same account prior to me wiring the money. This is why they suspected something was fishy.

He proceeded to walk me thru the Wells Fargo app to make the past due payment via XXXX. The first amount was XXXX. XXXX then claimed that it did not go thru and sometimes their system rejects payments with any cent value at the end and had me try again with the flat amount of XXXX. He then claimed that also did not go thru and now had me enter another transfer for the amount of both transactions ( I was in my car and did not check his calculations ) stating this is how they would be able to refund me the payments that hadn't gone thru since it was showing as pending from my checking account, in the amount of XXXX. That also 'did not go thru '. 

At this time I was transferred to a 'supervisor ' who proceeded to have me follow the same steps. The amounts were an additional XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX equaling a total of {$3400.00}. They assured me that all of the money would balance out because they were not 'posted ' transactions and all of the extra charges would drop off. 

I happened to be driving my Husbands ashes home while this all took place. I got home and looked thru our bills and we dont even have XXXX ( which is for houses/gas ) and actually have XXXX XXXX for our electricity. I immediately called Wells Fargo and filed a claim on all all 6 transactions. I was given a provisional credit for the total amount while they processed and investigated the claim. On Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that they are denying the claim due to me logging in to the Wells Fargo app via biometrics and making the transactions myself.

1112,"To whom it may concern, I am writing this letter in regards with my complaints I lodged against WELLS FARGO BANK. Please bear with me as I write down the story behind my complaints. 
Last week of XXXX of the current year, XX/XX/2019, I received an e-mail from a certain XXXX XXXX, who was hiring an open position as a MYSTERY SHOPPER. Due to the enticing pay [ $ 200- {$300.00} ], I responded that I am interested of applying to that position. 3-4 days after, Mr. XXXX XXXX texted me saying that I have passed their background checking and I will be sent a survey packet. After few days, indeed I received a priority mail envelope which has the survey packet, includes the survey form [ instructions how to survey a local XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX]. With that was also the CASHIER 's CHECK amounting of {$1900.00}. The instructions were to deposit/encash that cashier 's check into my own bank account, go to a local XXXX XXXX XXXX, survey the store from outside to inside and most especially the cashier as according to the survey instructions, cashiers have trouble of ringing out the store gift cards. After the survey, on that form still, I was tasked to buy 4 XXXX XXXX gift cards with {$400.00} each [ 4x $ XXXX= {$1600.00} ] or {$420.00} each if survey is not completed within 2 working days. However I still bought the 4 cards with {$400.00} each. Moving on, I was asked to scratch the back to reveal the pin nos, take a photo of them as well as the receipt of purchase and email them to their website or email address ... 
XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I went to Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX [ XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NV XXXX ] to deposit/encash the CASHIER, s CHECK. I was so happy as the check was encashed in no time at all. 
The next day after my work I headed immediately to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, surveyed, purchased the 4 cards with {$400.00} each, took photos of them as well as the receipt and emailed them right away to the said email address. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I received a text congratulating me from a successful survey and told that on XXXX of XXXX I will receive a 2nd survey packet. I was happy again because I just earned {$300.00} from the last survey and here comes another one. 
XX/XX/XXXX I received the 2nd survey packet along with another check amounting to {$2200.00}. 
XX/XX/XXXX, in the morning before heading to work, I went to Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX [ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NV XXXX ] to again deposit/encash the Cashier 's check. To my surprised, the bank teller told me that I can not deposit/encash the check just because the 1st CASHIER 's CHECK I deposited last XX/XX/XXXX bounced back to my account and charged me as it did not have fund. I hurriedly spoke to one of the bankers and inquired and told of the situation. So what he did, he called the issuing check company ... [ XXXX XXXX XXXX with address of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, MI XXXX ... tel no XXXX XXXX XXXX ] and found out that the check was not funded. So the banker concluded that I was scammed. 
Due to my devastation, I nearly had a car accident on my way back home and even did not report to work on that day. 
Days have passed still emotional stressed, I decided to visit my own Wells Fargo Branch [ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ] where I first opened my bank account with them. Spoke to the Banker [ XXXX ] available that day and sadly told him about what have happened especially the 2 incidents of how I deposited and encashed the 2 different cashier 's check to 2 different Wells Fargo branches as I believed if there were only proper handling and checking of the 1st bank teller, I should have not been scammed. The banker reported all my stories and complaints and told me that the Resolution Team will handle my case As the complaint was ongoing, I happened to tell the story to my co-worker whom accidentally has a wife working in Wells Fargo and also has a friend who works as a Manager of Wells Fargo. My friend consulted them and and both of them said that I can still file a case against them and get my money back because the 1st bank teller did not follow the proper procedure or the standard operating procedure upon checking the said Cashier ' Check ... an SOP of how to check and verify if the check is funded or not. According to them that SOP is called OIB, wherein apart from checking physically of the said check, a teller or a consulted supervisor have to call the issuing company, bank or company to find out the legitimacy of that kind of check. 
So I came back to the same Wells Wells Fargo bank where I first lodged in my complaint. Apparently when I got there, I was told by the same banker [ XXXX ] that the resolution team who handled my case denied my complaint and could not give my money back for the reason that somehow I have the consent or I myself has withdrew the money. So I filed a 2nd complaint in relations to the facts I learned from my friend ' s manager friend and wife. 
On my 2nd complaint I stated that why the 1st bank teller did not do the proper and most important SOP to check the cashier 's check when I was encashing it? 2nd, why was that the 1st bank teller looked onto the fund of my savings and not the fund of that check? As I was told also by my friend 's friend that the main reason why I have successfully encashed that check is mainly because I have more than enough fund to cover the amount if that check is not funded and get bounced back to my account if ever. Isn't that it should be the other way around checking the legitimacy of that check instead of my own funds to protect my savings/money as I have chosen and trusted their bank? That their first priority is to protect the welfare of their account holders? With what that 1st bank teller did, I felt, learned and experienced that all my savings is not protected at all from any untoward encashment in the future if their employees are not doing the right way. 
3rd, why did the 2nd bank was able to check, verify and even called the issuing company of that 2nd cashier 's check and the 1st bank teller did not where in fact the same policies and SOP apply on the same bank regardless of their different branches as far as my case is concerned? 
However, after weeks of waiting of the result, still they denied my complaint stating that on the day I 1st opened my account with them, one of the papers I signed was about the private banking consumer deposit disclosures. Whatever it is, MORALITY, POLICIES AND STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES should overcome in my case. 
If Wells Fargo will always protect the wrongdoings and malpractices of their employees, where is the REAL PROTECTION WELLS FARGO has promised to their account holders will go? 
My case maybe an isolated one ... or maybe not? But this incident should have been avoided if for sure some of their employees will really do their job properly and responsibly. 
I hope that lodging my complaints thru your institution, to the best of my knowledge and experience may help me find and get justice, return my money back to the extent of compensating me from the emotional stress, heartbreak, sleepless nights and financial difficulties Wells Fargo has brought me this TRAUMATIC NIGHTMARE in my life. 
Lastly, due to my financial incapabilities to hire a lawyer to fight my case against Wells Fargo, I ask you kindly and whole heatedly to help me with my case. 
Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart. 
Respectfully, XXXX XXXX"
1114,"XXXX XXXX I discovered someone had withdrew {$3500.00} from my Wells Fargo savings account. There were 7 withdrawals of {$500.00} each day from XX/XX/XXXX thru XXXX. The trail was from Wells Fargo to XXXX to individuals who I do not know.I had not heard of XXXX before this fraud occured. I contacted Wells Fargo Claims Assistance and reported this, I was questioned for a few minutes and was told I would be told the results of the investigation at a later date. A few days later I recieved a letter stating that "" we have determined that the transactions were made by you ''. We have had that saving account for several years and the only transactions we made were deposits. The Wells Fargo rep was not in the least willing to give me any information as to where the transaction started, what XXXX was and how the transaction took my money without my knowledge or requesting any action regarding my account. I requested Wells Fargo senf me documents used by Wells Fargo to determine that I was the one who made this transaction I am waiting to get these documents. Theysaid it could be 30 days. After doing some digging I found out that one must be enrolled in the XXXX  program in order to use their services. I am not enrolled. The Wells Fargo people were rude and uninterested it even trying to hear my complaint"
1116,"From my checking and savings account, I sent a wire transfer to a bank in XXXX ( where I live ) to pay for my rent XXXX of 2020. 

The transfer was flagged, so Wells Fargo kept the money at the branch, but even though they claimed to investigate the transaction issue and said that I should get the money within the next month, they did not return to money back to my account. 

However, in XX/XX/2020, Wells Fargo notified me that I would need to pay an additional fee and that after I paid the fee, I would have the money returned to my account. 

Despite paying the additional fee, the money I wired was never returned to my account. 

Further, now the Wells Fargo representatives ( XXXX ) informed me that unless I am physically present, they are unable to assist me in getting my money back and will take no further action. Wells Fargo representatives that have been my point of contact are aware that I live abroad and due to COVID, I can not go back to the United States as I would not be permitted to return back home to XXXX. 

It has now been over a year that Wells Fargo has kept my money, and now refuses to return it to the account. I was assured over a year ago that the amount would be returned to me, and it is appalling that it has not yet happened and that Wells Fargo is now, in email, saying that they will not assist me further unless in person. 

Wire transfer total : XXXXUSD Wire transfer fee : XXXX USD ( REIMBURSED ) Additional fee to have the money returned : XXXX USD"
1118,"My sister made a XXXX deposit for me on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, and I have not yet received the funds in my account and it is now, Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX. The earliest the funds could be available would be Monday the XXXX, a full 3 business day and 2 non business days later. The bank, Wells Fargo is holding the funds for too long and profiting off them for their own benefit. This should not be allowed and should be if it's not already against the law. What can you do to help?"
1122,"On XX/XX/2022 and XX/XX/2022, XXXX separate unauthorized XXXX transactions were transferred out of my Wells Fargo account to someone who I don't know ( XXXX XXXX - XXXX ). Each transaction was {$1000.00} each for a total of {$2000.00}. 

I notified Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2022 of the fraudulent activity. They told me they would look into the claim for the next several weeks, however they ended up denying my claim saying that I authorized them. I did NOT authorize these transactions. Wells Fargo assumes that I did. On XX/XX/2022, I had to have my bank username, password, and account number changed because my bank account was hacked the previous week. Due to my bank account being hacked, the culprit sent themselves {$2000.00} total saying that I knew them. I do not know them and I DID NOT AUTHORIZE these transactions."
1124,"I was a victim of a scam/ fraud situation, where I was notified in order to receive money promised to me from a "" buyer '' I had to upgrade my Wells Fargo XXXX account to a business account. The person that got in touch with me was impersonating a XXXX agent. That XXXX agent sent me multiple emails stating that I needed to send them {$350.00} in order to get that money. I sent multiple request to get this issue resolved and Wells Fargo has not been able to cooperate with me at all. This is a case of fraud and scam and I find it ridiculous that they are not able to help me out at all. Why would I authorize a payment if I knew I was being a victim of a scam or fraud. This is insane that I have to send all these complaints. I just want this issue resolved and my money returned."
1126,"I submitted a claim with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX about a scam/fraud I was victim of which utilized XXXX - I paid {$500.00} as a security deposit for a rental property another individual claimed to be the owner of and listed the property 's address and "" deposit '' in the transaction description. It turned out this person was not the owner of the property and created a fraudulent lease which I signed. 

I had a fine experience submitting the claim and was told I would hear back from them within 10 days. On XX/XX/XXXX I called again referencing my claim number stating I had not heard back. I can confidently say this was the worst customer service experience of my life. The representative I spoke with repeatedly told me how I was wrong and essentially blamed me for not understanding what was going on. She expressed zero empathy for my situation and gave me no indication that she wanted to help me resolve my problem. She belittle the fraud that I was a victim of and pointed out how it was solely my fault for not reading the "" big red letters '' as a part of their user agreement. I just stated that since this application had the banking information of the other party, I hoped they could help me in tracking that down. I had a police report filed and I would like them to assist. She told me that Wells Fargo is not reliable and that she couldn't even tell if I was really scammed or not. After being repeatedly cut off and her raising her voice, I raised my voice back and said I want to speak to a supervisor. She threatened to hang up the phone on me and said she couldn't connect me to a supervisor, even though it was roughly XXXX XXXX XXXX, where Wells Fargo is headquartered. I was directed to her supervisor 's voice mail and shared my thoughts there. 

It was truly humiliating working with someone with such disregard for an unfortunate circumstance. Wells Fargo has in my opinion made no attempt to help me find the person responsible and get my {$500.00} back. Ironically, I'm currently in the process of getting a mortgage on a new home with Wells Fargo and have had a great experience with the bank until now.. But, I'll have to reconsider that after this encounter."
1127,I filed a claim with my bank Wells Fargo for a transaction I paid for using my debit card with XXXX logo. I had been informed my purchases were protected. Wells Fargo closed my claim inquiry. I asked them why it was closed and they told me I would need to contact the merchant directly as I used a 3rd party app to pay for the service I did not receive. I know countless people who have used 3rd party apps and the validity of their claim was not based on who processed the payment.I paid a merchant for a service I did not receive and I have text communication from that merchant that proves I did not receive the service. I need to have the claim reopened so that I may provide the documentation that supports my claim. Wells Fargo did not even request supporting documentation. XXXX or Wells Fargo should refund my money.
1129,"Dear Sir /Madam My name is XXXX XXXX I fell victim to a scam company XXXX to which I invested money. I lost a total of XXXX XXXX At first, I was glad that the response came quickly, but now I realized that nothing amongst my requests were granted nor were any actions taken. It seems that my report was not properly taken into consideration. I report this to you as a XXXX XXXX of my bank Wells Fargo to look into the fact that my report to my bank was responded to with NO. The main reason for the existence of the Ombudsman is to resolve disputes between clients and their financial institution. 
So, let me tell you how this sad situation happened to me : It all started when I met a girl ( her name is XXXX, supposedly from XXXX, lives in XXXX in XXXX XXXX ), she started flirting with me and rubbing my confidence. After a while, she told me about investing and cryptocurrency and trading profits. XXXX interested me and invited me to trade with her. On XX/XX/2022 at first I started with {$100.00} and then she asked me to invest more, putting pressure on me and I agreed. On XX/XX/2022, I invested {$1000.00} XXXX with commissions and the purchase transaction was about {$1200.00} XXXX. I started making a profit on a small investment. I liked the idea of profit, the lady asked to take a loan to get more money to invest. But I told her I had some savings and on XX/XX/2022 I put down {$710.00} to add more funds. I wanted to have at least {$2000.00} in my account, so I added {$250.00}. On XX/XX/2022, I deposited XXXX XXXX, which cost me {$5100.00}. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, I deposited XXXX XXXX for about {$2100.00}. My friend insisted that I put in more money to have a decent amount as capital, so I bought XXXX, which is the equivalent of {$9200.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I bought another XXXX, so my XXXX account grew nicely. I continued to buy more, on XX/XX/2022 I bought XXXX equivalent to {$5000.00} and sent to XXXX wallet, all purchases and deposits were from my debit card from Wells Fargo to XXXX to XXXX  The problems started when I tried to withdraw funds from the XXXX platform, they asked for 15 % taxes on my assets, which were approximately XXXX XXXX equal to the XXXX XXXX I sent on XX/XX/2022. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX asked for 10 % of my capital for verification, threatening to freeze my account if I didn't send the money. So I sent them XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, apparently the verification failed because of my ID. After waiting to "" verify '' my account, they sent me a message saying that my account was under investigation because of my income, that in order to verify it and get it back to normal and as proof of my innocence I needed to send XXXX. This happened on XX/XX/XXXX, I was chatting with my friend and she told me that I should do what they were asking, So I used all my savings and retirement money to send them XXXX. I sent them XXXX about {$20000.00} XXXX dollars, to my surprise they told me that since I had sent an incomplete payment I needed to send them another XXXX to complete the check, which I did the same day. The next day I was waiting for a message from them, and they sent me an email saying that the XXXX headquarters did not accept the verification because I had sent them XXXX in installments. They offered to do the final verification by sending XXXX in XXXX payment. I contacted my friend and she told me that I had to send the money or my account would be blocked. I sent the money by wire transfer on XX/XX/2022, because that was the only way I could do it. After trying to withdraw my money several times with no success, I understood that I made the mistake and that I fell victim to a scam. 
So, I tried to solve this problem by myself with my bank. I asked them in official letters where I claimed my money back since they failed to protect me and they violated their own terms and conditions about the customer protection against money laundering andfraud. 
I want to point your attention to your own Fraud Defenses that can be found by thelink : https : //www.wellsfargo.com/com/fraud/fraud-defenses/"
1130,"On XX/XX/XXXX our company ( a non-profit organization ) made an online transfer of {$24000.00} from our Wells Fargo savings account to our Wells Fargo credit card account in order to pay off the current balance. On XX/XX/XXXX we discovered that the payment amount was deducted twice from our savings account instead of once. We phoned Wells Fargo that same day to notify them of their error. A Wells Fargo agent responded that the error would be corrected and the second ( erroneous ) transfer of {$24000.00} would be transferred back to our savings account. On XX/XX/XXXX we checked our saving account balance and discovered that the error had not been corrected. Phoning Wells Fargo on that same day, the agent told us that it would take 7 to 10 business days for the money to be returned to our account. We let them know that that length of time to restore our funds was unacceptable, but they said there was nothing they could do to restore our funds to the savings account any faster. 
In this day and age of immediate electronic transfers, 7 to 10 days seems extraordinarily slow for the correction of this errorthe banks errorand makes one wonder if Wells Fargo delays these types of error corrections for their own financial gain."
1131,"XXXX phished an email disguised as the title company I was using. The real escrow account and information is different than what this scammer submit, and me thinking the email was legit wire instructions. They knew when I was closing and to send closing emails."
1132,"Had tax refund deposited direct from irs to wells fargoXXXX for the last 3 years, did the same this year only XXXX changed their policy about XXXX  personal and business accounts and now Im not eligable for direct deposit. I call paypal and they say when direct deposits are rejected that they automatically send funds back to issuing bank, call wells fargo and they cant find the account number that ive used through them for 3 years so I call the issuing bank ( XXXX XXXX ) for the irs and they show the date they sent to wells fargo and also provide me a trace number but show that wells fargo has not sent the money back to XXXX XXXX I've ran around in circles for 3 months trying to find my money and can't get answers from anyone."
1135,"We asked Wells Fargo to arrange to close our account and transfer the funds to our XXXX bank account. This was arranged on the XX/XX/XXXX and we were promised the money by the XX/XX/XXXX, the transaction confirmation number was XXXX and the amount was {$9400.00}. The money did not arrive and following prolonged discussion with Wells Fargo the wire transfer was rearranged on the XX/XX/XXXX and we were promised the money by the XX/XX/XXXX.  Transaction confirmation number was XXXX. Again, this did not arrive. We have been in discussion ever since and have now asked for a bank check to be sent to us. We have been told that we can not have this until Wells Fargo have received the money back. We have said that this is unacceptable as we should not be kept waiting any longer for this money. The lady dealing with it is XXXX XXXX in the executive office and she has a case file open, number XXXX. 
She is sympathetic but says there is nothing she can do as responsibility for this is with the wire transfer department. We have asked for a senior manager to contact us but this has not happened."
1136,"XX/XX/2021 - Received call from someone identifying themselves with Wells Fargo Bank advising of irregular account activity and asking for identifying information which was provided under the impression it was the bank ( WF ). I was told I was going to receive text ( s ) and to provide WF with the code ( s ) provided. There were 44 in all - and upon inquiry the response was logical. The "" person '' from WF then ended the call and said they would contact me the following day. 
XX/XX/2021 - No call came - I contacted my local branch and asked for the previous caller by name and ID given - My branch advised no such person. My branch looked up my accounts and verified money had been moved from savings to checking where it was accessible for transfer. Confirmed 44 different transfer requests totaling {$14000.00} and referred me to the fraud section. Talked with the fraud department who advised I would get my money back. Advised to contact credit bureaus, police and XXXX and cancel credit cards. Checking and saving accts were closed and new ones opened. It should be noted that despite knowing a scam was in progress, WF transferred funds held in the old accounts to the respective new accounts which allowed the wires to be processed on XX/XX/2021. Opened fraud claim. XX/XX/2021 received account print out of transactions showing transfers occurred on XX/XX/2021 after WF notification of the scam by me.

Subsequently WF notified me of the claim denial resulting in continued efforts, additional calls and escalated claims all denied. Additional contact resulted in being advised Wells Fargo was a business and has shareholders as well as You could have done this to scam the bank.

WF clearly failed to take appropriate action when notified prior to funds transfer and failed to take responsibility for proceeding with what was clearly a scam in small amounts to an international account to avoid detection without additional verification."
1137,"I deposited a check to my bank Wellsfargo, it was mailed to my house as payment for renting a room from the person who committed the fraud. The check was credited to my account for MULTIPLE business days. The check itself was an overpayment of funds to me, so I asked this person who I know find out to be a criminal, how I can get the excess funds back to them. He gave me a XXXX account to use, then I sent the extra money that they overpaid. Right when I do that, within the hour, the check conveniently bounces and is reversed by Wellsfargo. When I called them yesterday they had no answers to me as to why the check was reversing, they told me I would have to call back in the morning. I called them today and they said it was a bad check. They are not taking any responsibility for the days the check was credited to my account, which it should not have been if it was a fraudulent check. And I'm unable to get the XXXX  funds back to my account as the fraudulent person has blocked all communication with me. 

I have pictures documenting all transactions and statements from wellsfargo. I was going to file a policy report but was told it is not worth my time. The amount was for {$5900.00}, it was deposited Sunday afternoon XX/XX/22. This transaction reversed yesterday XXXX in the afternoon, right after I XXXX  this criminal roughly half the amount from the check because it was overpaid the check also got reversed. Wellsfargo is saying that it was not there fault the check was fraudulent, but this cant possibly fall on the consumer to know what a fraudulent check is. They should be held responsible for crediting my account for days on end with a fraudulent check. They are a billon dollar banking institution, how can they not have systems in place to protect their customers in a timely manner. I now have a negative account balance of over XXXX dollars and they essentially wont do anything about it."
1138,"On XX/XX/2022 -- later in the night -- an unknown person gained access to my Wells Fargo accounts and deposited two fake {$1500.00} checks into my savings account, transferred to money to my checking account and then sent the money to himself before the checks could bounce, resulting in a total of XXXX unauthorized transactions. On XX/XX/2022, I reported the transactions as fraudulent which consisted of a two hour phone call with XXXX from Wells Fargo. To date, only XXXX of these transactions have been reversed, the two remaining transactions being XXXX {$500.00} XXXX transfers to a man named XXXX XXXX, {$1000.00} in total, half from my savings account and half from my checking account. Up until that point, I had never accessed the XXXX software embedded in the Wells Fargo banking app, and never had an account set up with them. At this point, I am still trying to reverse these final XXXX transactions to get the money back and help my mother 's credit score, as she is a joint owner of the account. Until XX/XX/2022, Wells Fargo denied our claims to reimbursement under the pretense that the transactions were not in fact fraudulent, saying "" either you or someone with your authorization authorized the transactions ''. On XX/XX/XXXX, however, after another phone call with Wells Fargo on the XXXX, Wells Fargo sent me a secure email through their website, and gave me a different response, saying they could not reverse the transaction or reimburse me due to the medium of transaction, as it was through XXXX and not directly through Wells Fargo. They said that I would need to handle the dispute through the recipient 's financial institution -- which I do not know as I do not know who XXXX XXXX, or whatever his real name is -- if I were to be reimbursed."
1139,"YOUR ABOVE SELECTION CHOICES DID NOT PRETAIN TO MY PROBLEM SO I SELECTED THE CLOSEST SO I COULD PROCEED WITH MY COMPLAINT Sick and tired of my local wells Fargo ATM not being properly maintained and serviced, I have filed several complaints about this but no one makes the bank properly service their machine located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NJ XXXX Last night and again tonight I arrived at the atm with a lot of cash that I do not want to carry around. Its potentially dangerous. The machine states it is "" currently not accepting deposits '' This has occurred numerous times in the past as well as the machine not being able to transact any business. Also the machine continually rejects perfectly good bills and deposits must be done multiple times. 

They can solve this problem by putting in a modern machine but obviously they choose not to and instead inconvenience the customer. 

I would like a copy of the service records for this machine so I may provide it to my elected Federal Representatives. I'm sick and tired of being inconvenienced and wont take it anymore. They have my money in their bank and pay nothing for it, they are not required to provide basic service to the customer."

Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I wired {$6500.00} to this same individual as a prepayment for 6 months rent. The individual was not a XXXX  XXXX and has run off with my money. I filed complaints with my bank, Wells Fargo, on XX/XX/XXXX regarding the money I sent. Because I authorized the send, they cant help me.

So theres no way they shouldve happened. 
Please help. Because they wont do anything."
1145,"In XXXX, XXXX, I was aware that my online wire transfer limit was between {$3000.00} and {$5000.00}. At that time, I executed a wire transfer in the amount of {$1500.00}. Wells Fargo temporarily locked my account in the event the transaction was fraudulent. 

In XXXX, XXXX, I had to go into a Wells Fargo branch in person to execute a {$15000.00} wire transfer as this amount was above my limit. 

In XXXX, XXXX, I was the victim of a reverse wire transfer fraud scheme. The fraudsters manipulated me to execute an online wire transfer in the amount of {$25000.00}. 
This transaction went through immediately with no apparent scrutiny by Wells Fargo. 

Where were the previous anti-fraud measures that I had experienced? 

When was my online wire transfer limited increased to {$25000.00}? 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I asked a Wells Fargo online banking telephone representative, when was my online wire transfer limit increased and she stated, XX/XX/XXXX. 

My fraud occurred on XX/XX/XXXX and I reported it on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Did Wells Fargo change my online wire transfer limit after my reported fraud? 

I respectfully request answers to these specific questions. Thank you."
1146,"Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), Regulation E. My occurrence is similar to XXXX XXXX 's occurrence yet she was provided her money back but I was not. Furthermore, Wellsfargo attempted to contact said scammers that took my money, which is a failed effort since the scammers would have absolutely no reason to refund me. Wells Fargo has failed to uphold the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), Regulation. I have made claims with the CFPB about this case on three other occasions ; XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX all being provided with similar responses that I feel to be unjust. If the investigation was done properly, you would find that the recipients on XXXX are scammer accounts to which I fell victim to. Files are provided below. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was caught up in a check fraud scam and I was scammed out of {$4000.00} total from my checkings account. The check was written to me by the scammer and sent via XXXX, who had added me on XX/XX/XXXX, explaining how they wanted to take care of me financially, with the check bank being "" XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX '' with a total of {$4700.00} and I was told that {$700.00} would be compensation for doing menial tasks of transferring the majority of the money to the designated accounts instructed. The check was deposited by me on XX/XX/XXXX, and since {$400.00} was immediately present in my account I was under the impression that the check was legitimate. I discovered that the check was fake only after the money had been transferred because of how persistent and aggressive the scammer was. {$3400.00} was scammed from me via XXXX with four transactions : 1 transaction being {$400.00} on XX/XX/XXXX to the fake XXXX account XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ), and 3 transactions being {$1000.00} each on XX/XX/XXXX belonging to XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ), XXXX XXXX XXXX ( whose email I can not find in the transcript ) and XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The other {$600.00} was scammed from me via XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ; this was only one transaction. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a claim with Wells Fargo about the scam in an attempt to obtain my money back. The XXXX claim for {$3400.00} was made on XX/XX/XXXX, but I was instructed by a Wells Fargo representative to make another claim for XXXX since the transaction was not complete on my statement record until XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX was also contacted about the scam and my XXXX account was frozen. On XX/XX/XXXX, a claim for {$600.00} was made. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a claim with "" CFPB '' to ensure that I would get my lump sum back. On XX/XX/XXXX, my "" CFPB '' complaint was closed since Wells Fargo responded. On XX/XX/XXXX, {$600.00} was returned to my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was called to ask the status of these two claims since I was never provided an update : the XXXX claim was deemed to be non-refundable since the transaction was made by me and not by someone else through hacking ; On XX/XX/XXXX, I was met with the same response meaning Wells Fargo is not complying with Regulation E of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and only contacted the scammer to get the money refunded rather than reimbursing me. I believe I am still owed my lump sum back because of the "" Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) specifically Regulation E '' since I was convinced thinking that this was a legitimate interaction and was "" promised '' a specific amount, but in reality, none of it was true. I have retrieved the XXXX messages that the scammer used to coerce me into this situation. I would just like the remaining {$3400.00} provided back to me since it is such a large amount to me. Tactics used were fake XXXX XXXX XXXX websites passed as legitimate "" I guess you are doubting me and thinking Im here to scam or steal from you. This is my acct details Account number - XXXX.

1147,"On XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX, I received a call from Wells Fargos number. I answered it and immediately a man who claimed to work in Wells Fargo fraud department started speaking. It all seemed so real. He told me that my account had been flagged due to a {$3000.00} transfer between by account and the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX in XXXX. He asked me if I had initiated this transfer and I informed him that I had not. He started walking me through the steps of XXXX and was saying I had temporary credits on my account and would have to send those credits to receive my funds back. He had me add the recipient as my name, XXXX XXXX, and my own phone number so I was under no impression that this was a scam. He induced me to send {$900.00}. Once I sent the money, I saw my bank account was completely drained. I immediately called Wells Fargo, it had not even been an hour later. They filed a claim and said I would be receiving my money back in 10 buisness days. I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX college student and really do not have {$900.00} to spend. This devastates me. I called last Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX to ask about my funds. A gentleman informed me I would be seeing those back in my account by Friday, XXXX. I was not too worried because I have been a customer for years and assumed they would help me. I called today on XX/XX/XXXX since the funds were not yet back. I was on the phone for three hours and transferred to XXXX different people. None could help. They informed me my claim had been denied since I authorized this, so there is technically "" no scam or fraud ''. They also informed me that they could not reopen the claim because it would be immediately closed again. I am so upset about this. I am completely broke and I trusted Wells Fargo with my money and with helping me get it back. I have heard of several people going through this and Wells Fargo has reimbursed them. I think it is unfair that I was told I would be helped and would receive those funds back and yet no one is helping me. I was told by representatives that they do not have control over XXXX, but Wells Fargo is one of 7 banks who owns XXXX so I don't understand. I feel that I should be protected under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( Regulation E ) and feel hurt that my bank is not helping and saying that this is basically my fault. I was under the impression that I was speaking to them and I did not just spend {$900.00} for fun. I would never just spend that amount, I don't have the funds to be spending that. That is a solid months rent right there. I'm struggling and I feel like no one at their bank is assisting in helping me with this case or helping to get my money back."

1156,In the first week of XXXX. I was no XXXX that there was some suspicious charges on my account from wellfargo. They hand shut down the account. So I went to the bank and talk to the banker. He noticed XXXX transfers thew XXXX to XXXX XXXX totalling XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars that I was not aware of. I do not no this person at all or never heard of here .So the banker called the fraud department to let them know about it..Fraud said they would contact me. Weeks went by no contact.Tried to contact them several times. Finally after weeks I got in contact with them.Now it's been XXXX months since this happened. After several phone calls and no solution. I was told to make a police report. I did and sent it to them. Waiting for response none. So again tried to contact fraud department finally got a hold of them they said they didn't receive the police report. So this time I faxed it and got a confirmation showing that the had received it.more times going by. Weeks and weeks. Still no contact back.finaly got a hold of the XXXX  fraud department. They said XXXX  we got the report back in XXXX??? Some body 's living. All I want thim to do is make good on the money that has been fradley taken from my account. I'm XXXX XXXX year 's old and retired with a fix income.and that is some of my life saving. And when I opened this account I was told that it was insured no problem. Here it is XXXX months going on XXXX months and no solution yet. Please help. And yes I want you to publish this. As it is XXXX XXXX to let alone fraud. Thanks XXXX XXXX XXXX
1157,"I attempted to purchase a {$450.00} product online on XX/XX/2022, using a website called XXXX. Following more discussion on the intended exchange, the seller blocked me from the website on XX/XX/2022, and it became evident that the whole transaction was a fraud. I immediately contacted my bank, since this is where the money transfer company XXXX, with whom I transacted, was integrated. The bank filed a claim, which they sadly had to shut thrice, since they think I initiated the transfer and have no recourse other than to wait for the seller 's bank to retrieve the monies. While I appreciate the circumstances, it is utterly unreasonable that they be without protection in this instance. I felt certain that if something went wrong, I would be protected, having used my bank to send money. Neither the bank nor XXXX assisted with me in addressing the issue ; I have photographs indicating that the whole transaction was fraudulent, and the seller 's account was even suspended on the platform utilized, as it was likely reported by several other individuals. On the XXXX of XX/XX/2022, I decided to file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), but my financial institution still contends that it has no choice but to wait for the receiving institution to retract the funds since I approved the transaction by transferring money. In order to make my claim official, I've filed a police complaint which is attached below, and I'm hoping it will help them handle the issue."
1159,"We were involved in a wire fraud scam as part of our home closing. On the week of the closing we received emails from our closing attorney regarding the timing and closing cost transfer details. Unbeknownst to us, the emails were spoof email accounts, and at the same time the closing attorney was communicating with spoofed email accounts for my email account. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX CT was the closing attorneys office that we use. They called the day before to confirmed that we had received those, which we had, but the account number was never verbally confirmed. {$120000.00} was the total closing cost that was sent. 
We wired the funds the morning of the closing based on the information we received. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, who is our bank, noticed there were some details in the information that did not match, but assured us as long as the account number was correct it would go to the right place. At the closing, it was discovered that the funds were send to a different account and we dug into and learned what had happened. We immediately notified our bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) as well as Wells Fargo ( Banking institution of the fraudulent account ) of the fraud. They spoke with myself as well as the closing attorney. Both companies told us that there was nothing they could do right awayXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX said they had to wait for the money to get posted, and Wells Fargo told us they couldn't do anything because we were not the account owners. We filled a report with the FBI and waited. 
The next week nothing was being done so we filled another report with the local police department in XXXX, CT. They immediately began the process of getting warrants and contacted the banks an told them to hold the funds. For the next several months we spent hours talking to all locations involved. We learned that the money had been transferred to XXXX XXXX as well, so they became involved also. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX received some of the funds back form the initial Wells Fargo account. They returned {$2200.00}. Wells Fargo returned {$10000.00} of the entire amount sent to them. XXXX after months of back and forth admitted wrongdoing on their part and refunded us {$55000.00} just last months. This has been amazing, but only brings the total to {$67000.00}. To date we are still missing {$57000.00} of the total that was sent.. 
Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX are claiming that there was no fault on their end and have returned what was available. The attorney 's XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has stated that they do not owe us this money either, although they sent all of our private information and closing cost and details to the fraudulent account in the first place for the scammers to be able to perpetrate this fraud.. The banks have refused to refund us any remaining funds and considered the case closed. We still have an ongoing investigation with the XXXX Police department to track down perpetrators involved. The FBI has not contact once to this day regarding this crime. I have reached out to them asking for any updates and they have said that they are backed up and will get back to me when they can. It has been 7 months since the incident and we still have not been able to recover our stolen money."
1161,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Wells Fargo in XXXX XXXX, SD addressed to my deceased Father ( passed away over 7 years ago ). They issued him a check fees that were assessed on his account and he was entitled for a refund. I went to the local Wells Fargo and a teller told me I would need to contact the number on the letter. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I called the XXXX # and gave the reference # that was on the letter. I told the assistant that my Father is deceased. He placed me on hold for a minute and then proceeded to tell me they cancelled the check and would send me paperwork to fill out to receive a check reissue and it would take up to 45 days for me to receive the documentation. 

In the middle of XXXX I called the XXXX # and spoke to another person ( XXXX XXXX and told her it had been 45 days and I had not rec 'd. the paperwork. She asked to verify my mailing address. She told me they sent it to the wrong mailing address and had me confirm my mailing address again. She said I should receive the paperwork in 14 days. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received the letter and XXXX form. I filled out the documentation and mailed back via certified mail along with a copy of my Father 's death certificate. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received back the green certified mail card with stamped "" SIGNATURE ON FILE '' XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX : I called the XXXX # as I did not receive a check re-issue. Spoke with XXXX about the check and she placed me on hold. Came back and said it would take 45 days for a check reissue. I said it has been 45 days. She put me on hold again. She came back and said she did not have any information of whether they issued a check or reviewed the paperwork. I asked to speak with a supervisor. She placed me on hold again. She came back on the phone and transferred me to her supervisor ( XXXX ). I spoke to XXXX giving her the history of this situation and she placed me on hold. She came back on the phone and stated they have reviewed my documentation and everything was in order and it will take up to 45 days for a check reissue. I asked "" You just now reviewed the paperwork, and its going to be another 45 days? '' She said yes. I asked "" Are you issuing the check today? '' She says that she doesn't control the issuing of checks and that it is another department that issues checks. I asked to speak to someone who does issue the checks. She stated it would have to be the XXXX Department. I asked to speak to someone from that department. She placed me on hold. Came back on the phone and told me that department is experiencing larger than normal volume of calls and that someone could call me back. I asked for the name of the person who will call me. She stated "" didn't know ''. I asked if they would call me back today. She stated "" didn't know ''. I asked for the title of the person that would call me. She stated "" didn't know ''. I told her "" I'm not comfortable about how this process is going and that I would contact the State of California. I then hung up the phone."
1162,I was a beneficiary for an account which was wells Fargo bank I've removed my direct deposit information that was from my social security XXXX and XXXX I've filed and personally addressed the fact that I was unable the accept the money that wells Fargo thoroughly investaged and granted me the beneficiary my claims but since I wasn't the primary on the accounts.
1163,"Here 's a timeline of the events on the day I initiated the wire. 
MONDAY XXXX XXXX, wire sequence # XXXX was entered at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX Montana XXXX XXXX XXXX 
XXXX, I called XXXX and asked for the wire to be stopped. She said she was just reading an email from the wire room and they had a couple questions regarding the trust account. So they held the wire and didnt even release it until about five minutes ago. She said, It shouldnt be a problem because it was only sent out five minutes ago. I said, Should they have even sent the wire since the questions werent answered? Then ( now ), I answered the questions while on this call to XXXX. We hung up and she filled out an official retraction form. 

XXXX the wire was released according to XXXX. This was after my phone conversation with XXXX? 

XXXX the wire was recalled according to XXXX. Why did it take so long for the recall? Why didn't XXXX immediately call the wire room to stop the wire. The funds were actually released AFTER my phone conversation with XXXX. 

XXXX WF ( Wells Fargo ) automated acknowledgement of the wire recall request inquiry. 
( ( ( WHAT HAPPENED at Wells Fargo BETWEEN XXXX AND XXXX? ) ) ) XXXX XXXX sent a debit notice of a large expense. {$45000.00} XXXX, my account still showed pending regarding the wire. 

I have tried several times to get specific time stamp details from Wells Fargo and they always say no due to me not being the account holder. I simply want to know if Wells Fargo actually recalled/stopped the wire in a timely fashion? And I want to know when the money was actually withdrawn from the Wells Fargo account? I know wires are immediately available and I am the victim of this scammer, HOWEVER, I tried my hardest to put a halt to this scam in a very timely fashion. It took XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX seventeen minutes to recall the wire. Is that normal in the banking industry? How long did it take WF? 

TUESDAY XXXX XXXX, my account still showed pending regarding the wire. 

XXXX, XXXX minute call to XXXX for Wells Fargo at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX TX and spoke to XXXX XXXX She tried to dismiss my concern/requests by telling me to get in touch with my banks fraud department. I proceeded to plead some more and told her the amount of {$45000.00} and that I felt it was a CRUCIAL time right now because of time zone differences. Texas banks were open, Montana banks are closed for another hour. Trying to explain that my account still shows pending right now and this is fraud and to not let the wire go through! 
She finally asked for the account number XXXX and put me on hold and shell talk to their escalations department. Came back and gave me XXXX information and told me to contact my bank. 

And that's how WF has been throughout all my attempts."
1165,"I was advertised from an account still active on XXXX. I was told to make an investment with them. Then started to ask for fee payments, which I XXXX sent. It was a total lost of XXXX. I reported this as a scam to my bank, Wells Fargo bank and also XXXX customer service, XXXX XXXX customer service, but wasnt able to get a cent back. I understand that because I sent the money thru XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, which you personally allow, I was not able to get my money back."
1167,XXXX XXXX XXXX ATTENTION PEOPLE this website link is a XXXX XXXX XXXX pleases do not give them your personal information or if they ask for you to download a third party app called ( ANY DESK ) DO NOT DOWNLOAD they screen record all your personal information and login into your bank info XXXX XXXX etc They are pretending to be a XXXX XXXX support team and they are not THEY constantly update they contact number on their website every time they scam someone so far its been updated XXXX times or more please spread the word I got scammed out over more than XXXX XXXX XXXX these people behind this criminal act try to get this website blocked on all sites do what you have to do to report this website
1168,"On XX/XX/2022, I became a victim of a scam attempt that used Wells Fargo ( WF ) XXXX 's service to obtain money from my bank account. The perpetrators used a caller ID that matched the Banks customer service line identically. I was instructed by the "" bank rep '' to pay myself a grand total of {$3500.00} via XXXX to cancel out a hackers attempt who was trying to steal my money. I called Wells Fargo to confirm if this action reflected on their end, unfortunately it did not which resulted in my funds being stolen. I filed a fraud claim with WF and later found out that the claim was filed with the non-fraud department who denied my claim which resulted in a total loss. I later found out that XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) customers had also become victims of the exact same scam attempt I had been experienced. However, XXXX  obliged with their members request for protection under the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act : regulation E, established by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I attempted to file a new claim with the fraud department ( correcting WF initial mistake of filing with the wrong dept. from my first claim ) given the new intel on XXXX 's policies. After further review, WF pleaded that since I authorized the "" transaction '' it is not considered fraud and they decided not to compensate me in any manner. I am filing this complaint to reveal that WF does not follow the federal law to protect its members and I hope the consumer financial protection bureau will follow up on this issue."
1170,"Today, XX/XX/2019 we used a service on our Wells Fargo app called XXXX. We used it to attempt to buy concert tickets for {$150.00}. We foolishly believed it to be safe because it was offered through our own bank and was offered on the app as a safe and secure way to send money. Immediately after sending the money the person offering the tickets dissappeared. At this point we looked in to XXXX online and discovered the multitude of scams. We called Wells Fargo and filed a claim but they said there really isnt anything they can do because we authorized the transaction. We tried to talk to XXXX and they said there is nothing they can do. I understand if we cant get our money back, but I find it shocking that they say there is nothing that they can do. I would think that they would want to try to track down the scammers and shut down their accounts. They didnt even bother to take down any information. If the scammers are allowed to continue to do this with impunity, it will just keep happening to unsuspecting victims. I dont understand why they wouldnt want to try to put a stop to this type of activity. Additionally, as a service that is provided through my financial institution and is touted as safe and secure I would think that my bank would want to make every possible effort to try to put an end to scams. They should definitely make it more clear that there is absolutely no protection, but additionally, they should actively try to peruse action against the perpetrators of these crimes."
1172,So i saw a listing on XXXX for a XXXX XXXX. I contact the seller and told him I would like to purchase the phones he told me that'd be fine as long as I sent him the money through XXXX. I know what XXXX is because it's in my Wells Fargo app and I assumed that i'd have buyer protection much like what XXXX offers. I sent him the money and never received the package and now he does not respond to my messages. I lost out on {$500.00} and would want the proper actions to be taken against this user and get my money back. I'll attach documents where me and him are talking and you can see that he is in fact receiving my money and even going out to say he is willing to refund.
1173,"XX/XX/XXXX - I received a text from "" Wells Fargo Fraud Alert asking if I attempted a {$3500.00} XXXX transfer '' I did not get a chance to reply to the text as within minutes I received a call from "" Wells Fargo '' ( the caller had hidden their actual phone number and replaced it with the actual 1-800 number on my Wells Fargo card ).

The caller identified himself as XXXX XXXX with Wells Fargo, badge # XXXX. 
The caller then walked me through the process of filing a claim with XXXX for these fraudulent transactions ( {$1000.00} & {$2500.00} ). 
Once complete, the caller told me I would receive an email from Wells Fargo with a link & instructions for resetting my username and password within 30 minutes. 
When I never received an email, I called Wells Fargo and told the rep I needed to speak with someone regarding the fraud case that was just opened an hour ago. 
This is when I was informed there is no fraud case open on my account. which is when I realized the whole "" filing a claim with XXXX '' was actually the scam. 

XX/XX/XXXX I opened the first claim with Wells Fargo regarding this unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfer. 
Wells Fargo claimed they have no responsibility because XXXX is a separate entity XX/XX/XXXX I escalated my dispute to the "" escalations team '' at Wells Fargo XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo Corporate complaints department denied my claim for same reason. I disputed their findings and sent them a link to the CFPB FAQ page "" Unauthorized EFTs '' Question # XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - Wells Fargo emailed me that they have completed their review and agree with previous finding they are not responsible. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I disputed this resolution again and asked if they read the info from CFPB. The agent I spoke to asked me to email the info directly to her. XXXX XXXX. 
I did, which opened a new Case number for my dispute. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I received an email from the new person handling my dispute which again says Wells Fargo is not responsible for XXXX transfer scam and they consider case closed. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I replied to email with a link to CFPB FAQ page and screenshot of "" Unauthorized EFTs # 5 answer and "" example '' ) I also left him a voicemail to call me to discuss"
1174,"I am trying to transfer funds ( specifically, {$10000.00} ) from my Wells Fargo account to an account in another bank ( in this case, XXXX XXXX ). I can not do this as Wells Fargo only offers options of ( 1 ) using XXXX to send money or ( 2 ) wire money or ( 3 ) send a paper check by defining the recipient as a payee. 
Option 1 ( XXXX ) does not work as I have my email associated with another account ( XXXX ). 
Option 2 ( wire ) costs {$30.00} Option 3 is inconvenient and outdated. I don't want to get a check as TD does not have branches and I won't be able to deposit is. I also want to keep all transactions digital. 

By designing the system to only transfer money using XXXX, it does 2 things : 1 - limits the amount to {$2500.00} which is not sufficient for many purposes 2- making it practically impossible to transfer money to other individuals ( e.g., family members ) or self at other banks. 

My money is now practically trapped at Wells Fargo, and it must be very convenient for them as they are making interest on my deposit and also limit their fraud risk by basically making it impossible to take money out of account, instead of building an up-to-date fraud prevention system. 

I'd like to see big banks forced to bring back the old ACH transfer system. 

Thanks XXXX"
1177,"I was a victim of a XXXX scam and am now out {$2000.00} because Wells Fargo is REFUSING to help me. Therefore I am opening yet ANOTHER complaint against them since they have denied my 2 claims : XXXX and XXXX stating the XXXX transactions were processed as requested which is not true because I was SCAMMED by an imposter claiming to be a Wells Fargo employee and even calling me from the Wells Fargo customer service number. Here is the story : On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX  I received a text message from Wells Fargo fraud alerts asking if I attempted a {$2000.00} XXXX transfer. I immediately responded No ( see attached image ). Seconds later at XXXX XXXX I received a call from XXXX, which is Wells Faro customer service, so I immediately answered ( see attached call log ). The man stated he was calling from WF fraud prevention on a recorded line, sounded very legit. ( I can't remember his first name but his last name was XXXX ) He there was an attempted {$2000.00} XXXX transfer to an XXXX XXXX. I said I had no idea who that was and did not authorize nor complete that transfer. He said to reverse it I had to add myself as a recipient on XXXX with MY name and MY phone number and redo the attempted transactions. He had me send myself {$1000.00}, than {$1000.00} again. Than the call dropped. Immediately I received 2 text messages from XXXX XXXX stating XXXX XXXX sent you money ( see attached image ). I immediately called Wells Fargo at the same # that called me initially XXXX and filed a fraud claim realized I had been scammed. I was sick to my stomach. Wells Fargo has since denied my claims. They told me these were "" authorized '' transactions and not fraud which is 100 % false. 

After Wells Fargo has been refusing to help me and doing much research and talking with MANY colleagues I have learned that Federal Law does protect victims of this type of scam. These kind of fraudulent transactions are covered by Regulation E, and consumers SHOULD be getting refunds. Regulation E is part of the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act which REQUIRES banks to refund consumers for fraudulent transactions on their accounts. The CFPB put out a directive in XXXX stating the law applies "" IF a third party fraudulently induces a consumer into sharing account access information ''. This is when someone tricks you, WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. So the whole idea that treachery is involved should me I AM protected by Regulation E. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXefunded their consumers who were tricked into transferring their funds by XXXX scams so WHY CAN'T WELLS FARGO DO THE SAME??? 

I have filed a police report and WILL take legal action if Wells Fargo can't step up to protect and help an innocent consumer."
1178,"XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2021 I had my Wells Fargo send a check for the total of XXXX to pay off a loan I had taken out many years ago with XXXX XXXX XXXX.

I'm also going to contact others about this mess up and blaming Wells Fargo for the problem! I have contacted Wells Fargo numerus times even the branch manager at my local bank for help they keep telling me they don't know what's going on?

I thought that's where I borrowed the money from in the first place but the loan still exists NOT HAPPY this was not the plan when I talked to your representative about paying off this loan I flower his orders and did everything he told me to do but you still did not apply my money to my XXXX. 
I have called your office to complain 3 times with no one trying to help me at all telling me sorry nothing we can do! I'm XXXX and can not pay the interest payment for anything that's the reason I paid it off in the first place. I spoke to a lawyer about this loan last year and they told me to just stop paying for it. But I tried doing it the right way and this is how you treat me???? I'm also going to contact others about your mess up and blaming my bank for the problem!"
1180,"On XX/XX/2022, I was scammed on XXXX XXXX by someone who responded to an item I had posted for sale. The buyer claimed she was interested in purchasing my item, and asked if I would accept XXXX for payment. I had used XXXX via Wells Fargo in the past and thought it was safe way to send and receive money. In my correspondence with this buyer, she claimed that she was unable to send me funds because my XXXX account was not considered a business account. She asked me to check my email, where I found a message from who I believed to be XXXX customer service stating that in order to receive my {$250.00} payment from the buyer, I first needed to "" verify '' my account as a business account, and that I needed to send a {$500.00} transfer to the buyer, which was going to immediately and automatically be sent back to me along with the {$250.00} my item was listed for. My understanding was that this was to provide proof of adequate funds. Believing this email to indeed be from XXXX, I completed the transaction, not knowing I had been scammed and that I hadn't received the {$250.00} payment ( this was a fake confirmation email ), but that I had sent {$500.00} to the scammer. What clued me in to the fact that this was a scam was another email requesting a second transfer due to not being able to process my "" verification '' as a XXXX business account. 

I immediately contacted Wells Fargo to request an interception of this transaction ( case # XXXX ). I was told by the Wells Fargo agent that she could not intercept the payment, but that she would file a claim to request that XXXX investigate it. I also attempted to contact XXXX directly, but was told to contact my bank. I saw that my payment to the scammer was pending for several days, and I thought that was because Wells Fargo had held it because of my call, but was dismayed to see that it was processed three days later. 

On XX/XX/2022 I contacted Wells Fargo again because I had not received any follow up ( case # XXXX ), and was told that there was nothing they could do to help me and that it was not possible to receive my funds back. I am writing to request that CFPB intervene on my behalf to have my funds returned to me and investigate and prosecute as necessary the perpetrators behind this financial scam."
1182,On XX/XX/2022 you cash a check and after obtaining the money I will clear the check ( with fire ) On XX/XX/2022 someone else changed it and deposited it from my account and the bank did not refund me the money they debited from my account.
1184,This guy XXXX XXXX XXXX scammed me out of {$4300.00}. XXXX he marketed an advertising scheme to put a XXXX XXXX decal on my car and drive around with it on my car. We first made contact XX/XX/2019. The cashiers check arrived XX/XX/XXXX. I saw the amount and became a little suspicious. I called XXXX XXXX to have the check verified and they verified the funds. I was unsure of it so I deposited using my XXXX mobile deposit to see if it was a good check. It was accepted so I thought it was good to go. He said once its been deposited use money orders and deposit them To the detailers account at well Fargo account number XXXX. I thought that was a lot of money to have my car wrapped and thought I could do it myself. He said you probably wouldnt want to do that because you could damage your car and it you do repairs wouldnt be covered by us. I said well he already sent the cashiers check so I went ahead and deposited the money orders. We talked about the weather and he said it would have to be a warm day and it was currently raining and a little chilly. The next day I didnt hear anything from him which was a Friday. Saturday morning I noticed my account was negative. I called the bank and they said the check had been returned because I endorsed it wrong. I was on hold for 20 minutes and while On hold I started researching cashier checks. It said they are now being used for scams. My XXXX dropped. The rep came back on the phone and told me to mail the check in just the way it was so I did. Monday I went back To Wells Fargo and told them I believe I was scamed. They said possibly and they also said he transferred the money into another account right after the deposit. They said I would have to do a claim with XXXX. They said I needed to do a police report. I called my bank XXXX and they said they didnt know who I spoke with on Saturday but the check came back Fictitious. I did the police report on that Wednesday. In the meantime XXXX refused to do a claim thru Wells Fargo. I felt like XXXX  mobile deposit is not as safe as it seems. And scam artist are using Wells Fargo because it seems it easier to munipulate their systems. The suspect probably had all fake identifications and still got an account with Wells Fargo. The police report came back and they found the suspect in Indiana. They said they had to send the jurisdiction to the Indiana.
1185,"Date of Complaint : XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX I received a job offer from a person on the professional social networking site, XXXX. The position was a well-paying remote position and the email looked reputable so I decided to pursue it. The employer claimed on XX/XX/XXXX that he would need remote access to my phone and laptop to install the software I would need to do the job. I would also receive a check in the mail for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars as upfront payment. Since I have worked from home before, this did not seem like a red flag as I've had other employers need remote access to my devices before. The job poster told me to click a link sent to my email for them to access the devices. I did and the poster downloaded software on my computer. Shortly after, I got an email from Wells Fargo claiming XXXX had been activated on my account and there was an unauthorized transfer of XXXX XXXX dollars to a name I did not recognize and I did not make. As soon as I realized that this was an unauthorized transaction, contacted Wells Fargo and put in a Fraud Claim. I received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX from the Wells Fargo Claims Assistance Center claiming that "" after examination of account and transaction details, it has been determined to be authorized. '' This transaction was unauthorized and I had no part in sending any money through XXXX. Under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, I am entitled to my money back but Wells Fargo is claiming the transaction was authorized."
1186,"I was scammed by someone pretending to be a government official. He unfortunately got {$2000.00} out of me. I did contact the bank with all the info, account number, amount etc. 
My bank said they contacted Wells Fargo and got no reply. They gave me a trace number but I am clueless as what I am to do with it. 
Please advise if you can."

1188,"My name is XXXX XXXX & I just realized that I was scammed 2 days ago. I called my bank ( Wells Fargo ) reported this incident and asking their help in order to get my money back. The agent who answered my call gave me 2 case number ( because i made 2 international wire transfer & both was a scam ). 

So I met this one person and he told me that he works at XXXX as senior data analyst & he earn a lot because of this crypto trading. One day he offered to teach me and he introduced me to this website ( XXXX ). He told me to deposit $ XXXX {$3000.00} because I am new to this so on XX/XX/XXXX, I made my first international wire transfer for {$1000.00} to an account in XXXX XXXX Then in few days he actually helped me to earn some money and he told me that he made a capital plan for me and told me to deposit more $ XXXX {$30000.00} in order to earn more. I was fooled and on XX/XX/XXXX I made my second wire transfer to an account in XXXX for {$10000.00}. After sometime he told me that there will be a very good trading nodes and told me to come up with $ XXXX - when i told him i have no money, he even forced me to take a loan & borrow from friends. Luckily, I dont like to be in debts so I lied that I failed because everyone is having a hard time during the pandemic & no one can lend me those money but i also told him that i can get {$30000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ( i will borrow the money from my family and the fund will only be available around XX/XX/XXXX ) so we agreed that I will deposit those {$30000.00} after I received the money from my family. But 2 days ago ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I checked the website and suddenly the website was closed so I was panicking and I asked him while trying to find information from XXXX & I found bunch of scamming stories that similar with mine. I was so worried & he told me that the website was undermaintenance and he gave me another new website which he claimed to be the new website XXXX XXXX  ) and I did able to log in & accessed my account there. However, I found this to be weird & I realized that i was scammed, so I called my bank ( Wells Fargo )- to ask for their help and they told me that they will register me and they will investigate & told me that it usually take around 30days ; but I am so worried because the longer it takes the smaller possibility that I can get my money back because i really need that money so I reported this scam to FTC and they gave me this website to help me get my money back. 
Yesterday, I tried to withdraw the money from the website XXXX XXXX  ) and as I thought they didnt let me withdraw & the customer service told me that I need to pay a prepaid tax for almost {$9000.00} in order to withdraw this money ( they said its according to IRS regulation & when I asked further about this regulation they ignored me ). I tried to log in today ( XX/XX/XXXX and the website is closed too - XXXX ). I felt so depressed and hopeless and I really hoping to get my money back so I called the number at the consumerfinance.gov because when i reported this to FTC, it said to call this number to get help in order to get my money back and the agent there advised me to fill in the online complaint. I attached the files that i have to support my complaint & I really do hope to get my money back so please I desperately beg you to help me. Thank you very much."

I then went back to the branch talked with the branch manager told him all of this again and he typed up a official complaint that got me the exact same result they will not refund me any of the money because they said I did it well that couldn't be more true or devastating to me they didn't even have the decency to call or email me to ask any more questions or hear my side more that once this is a lot of money to me and I feel absolutely violated. Please help me"
1191,"On XX/XX/2019, around XXXX Eastern Time, A guy by the name of XXXX XXXX promised me he could make me more money so I transferred XXXX $ on XXXX. It sounded legit because I had to go through my bank to sign on and give them money through it. I trusted him so i did and he then told me he got it and I would recieve a larger payment soon. He then blocked me on every website and all I have is his name and phone number. I asked wells fargo for a refund, and now im locked out of my account and I called XXXX and told me they couldnt help me."
1192,On XX/XX/2022 my XXXX cell phone number was hacked and transferred to a prepaid phone. My phone number was then used to transfer {$22000.00} from my Wells Fargo checking account to a XXXX XXXX XXXX account. I contacted Wells Fargo fraud department the same day and filed a claim. However Wells Fargo has denied my claim.
1195,"2 weeks ago Sunday, my wife XXXX XXXX XXXX Help Desk and got a number from the internet. The person picked up and answered "" XXXX Help Desk ''. He spoke to her about her problem, then asked for her XXXX Login ID to verify something. The conversation quickly morphed into a conversation that someone in Georgia was trying to hack her account and he needed to verify her account information. She complied, worried that someone would hack her XXXX account. The "" Help Desk '' rep then led her through a wild series of exercises eventually convincing her to add a XXXX recipient to her online banking and send him a "" test payment '' of {$440.00}. Reg Flag right? My wife had never used XXXX and was told it was a test payment and she'd get it back right away. There was no message that popped up telling her that {$440.00} was going out the door, did she know this recipient, and that she could never get it back. 

The moment the new recipient was established at Wells Fargo, I got a pop up warning on my phone. I went downstairs and questioned my wife and she told me what was going on. By that time the money was out the door. 

I immediately called Wells Fargo, but had to spend 1 hour waiting on the phone. We explained the situation and the Wells Fargo rep said they'd open a case. Two weeks later Wells Fargo sent us a paper mail making no reference to Fraud and saying that since XXXX "" authorized '' the payment, there was nothing they could do. XXXX never "" authorized '' a payment. She was tricked into sending money though social engineering. 

We'd like our money back and are seeking your help. XXXX knows exactly where the money went and to which account. Wells Fargo needs to help and they are offering none. If a refund is not possible, I am asking you to introduce legislation to require that banks are required to have a huge pop up window before sending money from XXXX informing customers that 1 ) Are they aware that they are sending money out the door? 2 ) Are they aware that XXXX payments are non-refundable and gone forever? I blame Wells Fargo for allowing this to happen without sufficient warning. We notified them immediately of the situation, and they sent us a form letter back telling us sorry for our loss. This is just wrong. We'd like out money back Thanks, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, CT XXXX XXXX"
1196,"The buyer is fraudulent they received the items as shown on the conversation pictures taken from XXXX chat with them and also got their refund totaling {$660.00} for both payments, they decided they dont want to cancel their transaction and called XXXX with false information initially stating the transaction was unauthorized then changing it to item not received because they want to get their fees back from XXXX. When the items paid for were delivered to them with the tracking number provided XXXX  closed the case and releasd the funds to me. I refunded them based on the funds available in my account through XXXX  with the following calculation the fee on the {$290.00} received was {$8.00} and the XXXX  fee on the {$400.00} was {$11.00} which total {$20.00} for fee on both payment of $ XXXX $ XXXX which XXXX left with {$660.00}. The buyer was refunded {$660.00} on XX/XX/22 to their XXXX  name XXXX XXXX with phone number XXXX confirmed by XXXX before the payment was sent. They are responsible for the fees charges by XXXX because they cancelled their transaction and the amount released by XXXX was credited to them through XXXX  on XX/XX/22 please find attached proof of refund payment completed. The buyer claimed they did not receive the XXXX  transfer and wells fargo refused to reverse the transaction or put a trace on the transaction or cancel the XXXX  transfer since the buyer claimes they didnt receive the XXXX  refund."
1197,"My complaint is about the bank allowing international scammers to launder the proceeds of crime through the bank. My bank in the XXXX has informed me the bank are aware these people are using these accounts to steal peoples money and yet still allowed this to happen. The bank in question here is : Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX CT XXXX XXXX California CA XXXX.

1199,"I was a victim of an online scam. A company sent me some checks to deposit in my account so that later I could send them to another party. However, three days after the deposit of the checks, the bank says they were returned because they were altered/fictitious and now they are deducting the amount from my account. As soon as I deposited those checks into my account, I transferred them to the other party, so now that they found out the checks are invalid, they are taking my own money. 
Why did it take them so long to verify the checks? In any case, the bank should have not allowed the transaction before they verified the check, not 3 or 5 days after I made the deposit. 
The first check was deposited on XX/XX/XXXX and was returned on XX/XX/XXXX. It was a deposit of {$2000.00}. 
The second check was deposited on XX/XX/XXXX and was returned on XX/XX/XXXX. It was a deposit of {$1500.00}. 
Now I lost a total of {$3500.00} dollars just because my bank, Wells Fargo, doesn't do the appropriate verification before just letting go of any money. 
I already called my bank and they just let me fill out a complain but the representative said probably nothing will happen."
1200,"I purchased XXXX tickets for my son and I from what I thought was reputable dealer for {$160.00}. The seller provided name, phone number, bank info, and email address. I was advised to use Wells Fargo banking app to transfer the funds using XXXX. After money sent I waited for tickets to arrive but nothing. Phone calls were sent straight to voicemail and texts were no longer responded to. After reaching out to my bank to report the fraud, I was told that they hold no responsibility for XXXX usage despite the money transfer service being in their application. I was also not given information regarding transaction despite Wells Fargo requesting information when utilizing app. I believe that is a shame that Wells Fargo and XXXX  XXXX XXXX promote and make money off of an service that provides zero responsibility for fraud and insecure transactions."
1203,"On XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, I made payments of {$500.00} and then {$250.00} to a seller I found online for some jewelery. Fast forward approximately a week and it turned out that he couldn't do it. So when I asked him for a refund, he told me to call my bank and blocked me and deleted all his accounts. So I opened claims for it through my bank, Wells Fargo and I told them that I had screenshots to prove that I was scammed. They told me to save it for later, so I did. Claim numbers XXXX for the {$500.00} charge and XXXX for the {$250.00} charge. I called them today to check in and they said it was closed already because I technically sent the money. That's not fair. I got scammed out of {$750.00} and when I told them I had proof, they asked me not to send it and to wait. I would appreciate it if you could help me get my money back from them."
1206,"Hello, I am a us citizen who lived there up until my father got sick and passed away. He left me problems in XXXX and I had to go there to take care of it legally. It took years of straggling! In the mean time I met the father of my children and I have kids there, I sold my property in XXXX legally through an escrow company, I have paid all my taxes from the sale, and now I wish to buy a condo where I stay with my kids which is currently not in XXXX or the us. I was explaining this to my branch and no one seem to know how to help me and they kept me on hold for hours without a proper answer! I had sold my property legally and I wish to recieve my funds in my XXXX XXXX branch. I have all the details and documents that are necessary for this transaction- but still, I can not have a home where I am currently residing since my money is kept hostage by Wells Fargo bank! My branch explained I can transfer {$5000.00} a day! I have XXXX in my account and every transaction costs a fortune! This is more then an outrage and a very bad way to take advantage of an international customer. 
I would appreciate your prompt respond on this matter."
1207,So I filed a claim with wells fargo fraud department about a unauthorized XXXX transfer that was done in my account thats I was unaware of. I waited 10 business days to be only told that I was the one who sent the money when I have no relations to the person nor have I ever met them to be sending them {$440.00} and im a victim of fraud and need my funds returned back to me. They closed my account I have been banking with them for a long time and it frustrates me that they refuse to help me.
1209,On XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to enter my XXXX account and on their website page it stated there had been suspicious or fraudulent activity on my account and I was to call their security department immediately at phone number # # # # # # # # # #. When I did they said they had to run a security scan and downloaded a program where they took over my computer. After they ran the so called scan they said they wanted to check and run the scan on my other bank accounts. They sounded so very professional that I allowed them to run the scan on my Wells Fargo accounts. They now had total control of my computer as I sat back and watched the cursor move around by them without me ever touching my mouse! They stole ALL of my money from both accounts at Wells Fargo which was fraud of course but Wells Fargo WILL NOT reimburse the stolen funds.
1213,"A criminal fraudster opened a fake escrow bank account at Wells Fargo. The account information is as follows : ABA/Routing No XXXX and Account No XXXX. The criminal was posing as the company, XXXX XXXX. My husband and I were given these fraudulent banking instructions by the criminal to send our closing funds in the total amount of {$260000.00} on our new home in California. My husband sent a wire in the amount of {$130000.00} and I sent one in the amount of {$130000.00} from our separate XXXX XXXX XXXX accounts on XX/XX/XXXX to the fake escrow account. We obviously were not aware that the wire instructions were fraudulent until after the wires were already sent. The next day on XX/XX/XXXX when we were made aware by the real XXXX XXXX company that they had not received our wires at their actual bank account we immediately contacted our bank and Wells Fargo. We told the representative at Wells Fargo the situation and asked to be transferred to someone that could help us and escalate this issue. We were hung up on. We called back and got another representative who told us that they couldnt do anything but to call again the next day and speak to someone at the Executive Office at Wells Fargo when they would be open in that department. The situation was not taken seriously and action was not taken as it should have been to prevent delay on this time sensitive fraud issue. On XX/XX/XXXX we again called Wells Fargo with XXXX XXXX on the line and were informed by a Wells Fargo representative that the fraudsters account was placed on hold. Wells Fargo would not provide any other information. On XX/XX/XXXX we called Wells Fargo again with XXXX XXXX on the line and a representative at Wells Fargo named XXXX confirmed that the amount of funds in the fraudulent account covered our total wire amounts without giving us the actual account value. At this point with the fraudulent account on hold and the full amount of funds in the fraudsters account, there should not have been any activity allowed on the account and our funds should have been secured. All calls were recorded at both Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we filed an IC3 internet crime complaint form with the FBI and an FTC complaint form. We also filed a police report with our local police department. 

After that, Wells Fargo was less than helpful and refused to give any information on the case or the status of getting our funds returned to us. There was no process in place to escalate and handle this situation at Wells Fargo. Also, Wells Fargo allowed a criminal to open an escrow bank account without proper paperwork or verification where large sums of money can be moved around instantaneously. 

Our local detective contacted Wells Fargo and again no information was provided. We submitted a complaint letter to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX telling them the entire situation. We were contacted by a representative who responded to some of our concerns but claimed that they could not locate the call that took place on XX/XX/XXXX where the representative confirmed our funds were still in the fraudsters Wells Fargo bank account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, a wire in the amount of {$120000.00} was sent to my bank account at XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo refused to acknowledge that they sent that wire to my account. We were able to eventually have XXXX XXXX confirm that the wire was from Wells Fargo. We have not received any other funds from Wells Fargo to date. We are owed an additional {$140000.00} from Wells Fargo. They will not provide any other information and are refusing to send the rest of the funds that belong to us. They confirmed that the money was there and that the account was on hold so they are responsible for any transactions that may have occurred after the account was placed on hold. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX stated on a call that Wells Fargo still has not responded to their requests about the open investigation."

My husband and my XXXX travelled to XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX for a family emergency and my XXXX XXXX of XXXX developed an XXXX in his XXXX, he needed an urgent medical attention. There was a lockdown of the international airports in XXXX. 
They couldnt have flown back to the US. In the month of XXXX, they needed money for a medical emergency which was XXXX XXXX and also for the roofing of our home against rain. 

On Monday XX/XX/XXXX, I went to Wells Fargo to do a bank wire, since I was unable to do it online. I arrived at XXXX branch in XXXX. Waited on the drive through line for about 45min only to be told I need to have an appointment with representative inside bank. 
The Bank Teller at the drive through window refused to make my appointment while I was already on the drive through line. She told me she could not assist me further and I needed to call the branch directly to make appointment. 

I drove out of the drive through to the banks parking lot, then had to sit in my car more time and held unto the phone while that same branch took my call. After about 15 or 20 minutes, my call was finally answered. I was given an appointment for XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. 
I received a call from the branch a day prior to XXXX confirming reason for my appointment. They then told me I needed to do my transaction online. 
I explain to them I had no option online to do a money transfer for XXXX. They then told me banks might me down in XXXX. 
I told them that was not the case, my husband confirmed with his bank in XXXX that all banks were working fine and international bank wires were working fine too. 
After our call ended. I was so upset how I was treated at branch drive through and now getting that call from branch, I decided to call Wells Fargo 800 number to complain about my experience. 
When I called the 800 number for Wells Fargo, I narrated my ordeal to the representative and I told them I no longer want my appointment at the XXXX branch, due to the fact that I felt very mistreated and unfairly received. The representative then canceled my appointment with XXXX branch, New York and gave me a new appointment on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX at XXXX branch, New York . 
When I arrived at the XXXX branch on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told I dont have appointment. I told them I made appointment through the 800 number. They still told me I have no appointment. 
I even ask them is that time slot for my appointment open? I was told yes!! Emphatically! They still refused to take me in the branch. 
At that moment I was losing my XXXX  and also XXXX  from XXXX I couldnt believe this. I then went to my car crying so hard, in so much XXXX. I am not too strong health-wise. The thought of my little XXXX XXXX  me more because he was in so much pain. 
While I was crying in my car, I watched people enter bank for their appointments. And Im being told I cant t enter and I dont have appointment. 
I tried calling my friend to come drive me home because I lost the composure to drive myself. I couldnt reach her but I managed to calmed down a bit and drove home crying in pains. 
I got home, I called the 800 number again, only to be told how sorry they are for all the troubles and the soonest appointment they could book me for is Friday XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX. This is almost four days gone without a success for my bank transfer. 
In the morning of Friday XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX, I was still at home getting ready to head to the bank for my appointment ; I received a call from Wells Fargo customer care representative telling me that she wont allow me into the bank for my transaction despite her confirmation of my appointment for that day at XXXX. 
I felt grossly and unfairly harassed and stigmatized with no reason even when I inquired why I am being denied my right to banking services. She harassed me on the phone. Her name sounds like XXXX XXXX from the XXXX Branch, New York. This conversation was recorded and it is attached herein in this flash drive ( would mail evidence upon request if not enclosed ). 
This was the height of it. The conversation that went down with this last Wells Fargo bank representative was recorded by me because this became so obvious that I was deliberately and XXXX  stigmatized and stopped from conducting my legal banking transaction for reasons best known to them. I need to know that reason too why other customers were allowed into the bank except me. 
I was XXXX  profiled and harassed. I would like you to listen to that recorded clip. I also have records of all the bank appointments Wells Fargo made for me but turned me back each time I arrive at the bank. 
I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX and under 24hours from the day of my appointment with them, they wired my husbands money for him to XXXX. By the time he got it, a lot of losses have been incurred. 
Our house whose roof was destroyed by a strong wind was further destroyed by rain. Had Wells Fargo sent the money on my first appointment, our home would have been saved from a destruction that would cost us just {$45000.00}. Now the cost is over {$170000.00} to fix. 
My XXXX lost his XXXX  to that XXXX  XXXX because there was no money to buy him the prescribed medication. He had to go on for a week and more without taking proper medication. This is the worst feeling of unfairness a mother can experience. Had it not been for the swift action by XXXX  XXXX XXXX, my XXXX may have been dead. 
I was XXXX and my health deteriorated due to all these sad experiences Wells Fargo subjected me to. This lead me to a search for a XXXX  to help me through it all. 
This gross misconduct and harassment by Wells Fargo, stigmatization of my person, denying me of my banking rights and XXXX  profiling me with no reason whatsoever has cost me a lot and that is what informed this complaint through the court of arbitration. I am deeply sad! 
To this end, I am asking the Wells Fargo bank for a monetary compensation of {$300000.00} for all these damages and irreparable losses they cost me. 
Where I am not getting any fairness in this complaint, my husband would have no option than to initiate a lawsuit against Wells Fargo in a competent traditional law court with professional lawyers. We need justice! I need justice!! 
I am optimistic of your prompt response on this and fair hearing. 



Yours sincerely, XXXX XXXX"

1225,"The email between tax preparer and tax payor got hacked.

Tax Preparer got an fake email ( pretenting it is from tax payor ) giving instructions for direct deposit for tax refund money from IRS and state into bank account. Fake email contained fradulent account number.

IRS has sent money to fradulent account but with Tax Payor 's correct name.

Even though there was correct Tax Payor 's name, Wells Fargo bank did not match the name on the ACH transfer and name on the account number so just deposited the tax refund money into fradulent account. 

If Wells Fargo matched the name of the tax refund and name of the account like most other banks do, this fraud have been stopped. But Wells Fargo Bank 's LOOSE policy of not matching the name We called Wells Fargo Bank to correct this transaction, ( just returning the money to the IRS ) but no action from them yet."

Both XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and my self have been trying to get Wells Fargo to respond and or return my {$10000.00} with no luck.

1227,"XX/XX/2022 I was trying to sell my bike. A person contacted me through XXXX to purchase the bike. XXXX is my bank 's form of XXXX. Someone from XXXX contacted me and said I had to put in the money into the account to show that I could protect the payment. I took screen shots of the communication. I sent them {$610.00} which was the asking price for the bike. I was told by XXXX I would get my money back and the payment for the bike. 

That did not happen. It was a scam!! I was unaware someone could hack XXXX as it is promoted through Wells Fargo.I lost the money which my mother transferred to me through XXXX. I had to borrow money because I didn't have any which was why I was selling the bike! 

My mother contacted Wells Fargo BEFORE the XXXX transaction went through. She told them what happened and they opened a fraud claim. I also called and made a claim. Wells Fargo let the transaction be completed even though they were told it was fraudulent. 

We have both tried to talk to the bank, spending hours on hold. Three claims were submitted and all denied. They still think I was buying a bike! I was selling. I have the screen shots, they did not care. They do not listen to what happened. They see that my mother transferred money to me and can't grasp the events correctly. We have tried to explain so many times. 

We wrote to the Consumer Federal reserve for help and they sent us to you. 
All I want is my {$610.00} back. {$500.00} of that belongs to my mother. Please help us. Wells Fargo should honor the request to refund the money because it was their website that got hacked. AND they let the transaction go through even though we asked them to deny it. 

Thank you for your time.

1229,"XX/XX/2020 - {$500.00} {$500.00} XX/XX/2020 - {$250.00} {$490.00} I was contact through XXXX regarding a job opportunity to work from home for XXXX XXXX . I do not have the communication through XXXX  because the person blocked and deleted the messages. Also, blocked me from XXXX. They stated I would be doing XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX and they would send me funds to purchase the materials from Vendors they work with, along with a XXXX sign on bonus. 

A couple of days has passed once the funds was released they blocked me. I had know idea this was a scammed because I called the bank to verify funds and it was available. I tried to contact them but was unsuccessful. The bank was going to close the account but a representative from loss prevention called me on XX/XX/2020 at XXXX XXXX  ( CST ) I informed her what happened she stated she was not going to close the account due to a scam and my account should go back to positive. As of today, my account is still - {$1300.00}. My paycheck goes in this account and I had to stop it because I was going to be loosing money. I talked to the bank everyday and they will not help me. I did not receive the material to start work. 

Also, on XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from my bank stating my card was declined. They were trying to purchase an item from a company in CA. My card was turned off, even if it was it would not process."
1231,"On XX/XX/2020 Wells Fargo initiated a wire transfer ( # : XXXX ) through my business bank account ( for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) in the sum of {$6800.00} absent my authorization to an individual unknown to me, named XXXX XXXX. This money was sent through wire transfer from my XXXX bank account to XXXX XXXX at his Bank, Routing Number XXXX, account number XXXX. I was inadequately and improperly notified by Wells Fargo of this specific transaction, and when I went to dispute this wire transfer ( which took place on the eve of XX/XX/2020 ), I was advised by Wells Fargo that the money was already withdrawn from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account early in the morning on XX/XX/2020. Thus, Wells Fargo did not take proper precautions to confirm this exact wire transfer, and XXXX XXXX never took precautions to hold this transfer of money in abeyance until such transaction was confirmed. It is my understanding under the federal and state banking guidelines that the appropriate time period should have been at least a 24 hour period for clearance of funds. XXXX XXXX reneged upon enforcing any fraud action against their customer, XXXX XXXX, and Wells Fargo disclosed XXXX XXXX ' address which is XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, New Jersey XXXX and told me to go after XXXX XXXX myself, that because of Covid 19, they are not exercising all of their duties and regulations as what was more carefully done in the past. I expect as an American Citizen, that the banking regulations and laws would protect me in such a situation, and that it is their responsibility to do so and not have me personally resort to debt collection with an individual who clearly committed fraud and larceny under the law.

1236,"I was a victim of wire fraud. I wired money from my XXXX XXXX  account to a Wells Fargo account. The beneficiary of this wire was "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' but the account that the money went to was "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. I wired the money on XX/XX/2021 and found out on XX/XX/2021 that my money was missing when the law firm that should have received my money notified me that they had not received the money. On XX/XX/2021 I went into the local XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and spoke with the branch manager, XXXX, who said he would file wire recall request to recover the money from Wells Fargo. I called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2021 and spoke with a representative named XXXX in Loss Prevention ( XXXX ) who advised me that my {$81000.00} was frozen in the account and that XXXX XXXX will recover it if they file a wire recall. I recorded the conversation with XXXX and can provide that to you. I was advised on XX/XX/2021 by XXXX at XXXX XXXX that the wire recall was unsuccessful and my money can not be recovered. I had a conference call with XXXX at XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo Loss Prevention and we spoke with 2 different representatives that told us different information. One representative at Wells Fargo said they did not receive the wire recall request from XXXX XXXX, and the 2nd representative said they see the wire recall but since the account was frozen, that XXXX XXXX  would need to file a "" hold harmless '' or "" indemnification '' letter to Wells Fargo to recover the funds since they were in the "" General Ledger ''. At that time, XXXX requested the case with XXXXXXXX XXXX to be assigned to "" XXXX '' or "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' I called XXXX XXXX on a daily basis from XX/XX/2021 until today XX/XX/2021 and received the same answer, that they filed the paperwork with Wells Fargo and there was nothing more that could be done. The only information I have is that an investigator with XXXX, named XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) faxed the hold harmless or indemnification letter to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2021 and there has been no response. Today, XX/XX/2021, I called Wells Fargo Loss Prevention and asked to speak with a supervisor. I was transferred to the "" executive team '' and spoke with a representative, XXXX. XXXX was friendly and patient with me. He was unable to release specific information about the account, but gave me general information as it pertained to me. XXXX said at some point prior to XX/XX/2021, another victim sent a wire transfer into the fraudulent account in excess of {$100000.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  to Wells Fargo. This money was withdrawn or transferred from the fraudulent account. At some point XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  filed a wire recall and indemnification with Wells Fargo to recover the money that was sent. At that time, Wells Fargo sent XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the {$81000.00} that I wired into the account on XX/XX/2021. Therefore, Wells Fargo used my money to indemnify the victim that lost more than {$100000.00}. I have been told by many Wells Fargo employees in different departments ( Fraud XXXX, Customer Service XXXX, and Loss Prevention XXXX ) that Wells Fargo flagged the account as fraudulent and had my money on hold. It was not until today when XXXX advised me that Wells Fargo used my money and sent it to another customer. At this point, I have lost my money and have lost the house that I was purchasing along with the XXXX money that I put down on the house. 

I reported the incident to IC3.gov and have been in touch with FBI Special Agent XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). Agent XXXX advised me that he has done all he can and that he linked my incident with another crime that was being handled by XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) with the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. I spoke with Agent XXXX who advised they are in the process of trying to arrest the criminal that has been receiving the fraudulent money, but there is little hope of any liquidated damages. 

At this point, my complaint is with the way that XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo handled the wire recall, fraud investigation and attempted recovery of my money. When XXXX XXXX branch manager XXXX advised me on XX/XX/2021 that my money was gone and there was nothing more that could be done, I couldn't believe it. It was only when I conference called with him and Wells Fargo that he assigned the case to XXXX which didn't do anything until XX/XX/2021. I was told that the case was assigned to another investigator at XXXXXXXX XXXX  that was on Bereavement leave and the only reason why XXXX XXXX called me is because the FBI Special Agent XXXX XXXX emailed XXXX XXXX at XXXX to have someone call me. If XXXXXXXX XXXX  had responded to the fraud issue from the first day I found out about it ( XX/XX/2021 ) and filed the hold harmless indemnification letter on that date, maybe I would have my money instead of someone else."
1241,I was sent a check to deposit and cash through my checking account at Wells Fargo Bank. The person I was cashing the check for stated that this woman made a purchase and owed him the money. But because he was out of the county he could not cash check. He said he had the owner of the check make it to me so I in turn could send the money to him. The check apparently was not sent by the owner of said account. This resulted in me being accused of fraud. At this time I am not allowed to open any checking accounts because of this. I got scammed. I even spoke to the owner of the check and told her what happened. She said she does not blame me. What action do I need to take to fix this problem?
1243,"I made arrangements to buy a dog, a contract was signed and paperwork completed. The money was sent through XXXX and XXXX XXXX totaling XXXX.

After completing a claim with my bank Wells Fargo and 3 hours of being transferred from department to department, i was told by Wells Fargo basically it was 3 hours wasted and the money was gone.

Because of COVID-19, my wife and I decided to cancel our cruise and XXXX  refunded our money back in XX/XX/2020 to my account. 
This account was blocked because I had not used it for a while considering that I was not able to visit the USA since XX/XX/2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic. I am a XXXX person living in XXXX and I was not able to use the account because I could not cross the XXXXUSA border XXXX 
Once the border reopened, I went to Wells Fargo to reactivate my account, but the bank said it was not possible since it had to cancel all the bank accounts that belonged to people living outside the USA. 
The bank gave me the money I had in my bank account but there was not the refund from XXXX. Also, I asked for my bank account statements and the bank did not give them to me. 
Since the reopening of the border, I have gone several times to Wells Fargo in XXXX, CA and once in XXXX XXXX, CA for any information regarding the refund from XXXX. Wells Fargo claims that it does not have the money, but XXXX shared with me the XXXX number and, still, Wells Fargo does not give me my money and it does not provide any proof that it does not have my money. 
Please, I need help to get my money back."
1246,"I recently tried to purchase concert tickets using the XXXX service. The service is backed by all of the major financial institutions making it seem more legitimate and trust worthy than other payment services like XXXX and XXXX. However, this service seems to worse and less secure than those. The person sent a request for me to transfer the money and I did so. It took multiple days to process the transaction and there was no clear way for me to monitor it and cancel it if need be. Two weeks have gone by and the person I was trying to purchase tickets from still hasn't given them to me. I tried calling Wells Fargo to see if they can reverse the transaction. The first person I spoke to said they could do a "" money move '' and get me the money back. After that, I got transferred multiple times before someone put me on hold for about 20 minutes just to tell me that there's nothing they can do. They are aware of the transaction and even know that the money was deposited in an account with XXXXXXXX XXXX. However, they refuse to even contact XXXX about it. I called XXXX myself to see if there was something they could do, but they claimed that they couldn't do anything even though I knew the email associated with the account. They recommended that I speak to Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo basically told me that I have to get the money back on my own."

I obliged, but told them if the piano sold first, i would ignore the check. i sold the piano to someone else on XX/XX/19. on XX/XX/19 i received a XXXX cashiers check for XXXX $ from the original buyer, and wrote them and told them the piano was sold, would you like to me to rip up the check. they said "" no '', that they were in a bind, and if i would get the movers the money, i can keep XXXX $ for myself for helping them. it sounded like a win/win. i took the check to my local Wells Fargo, and waited until it cleared. On the morning of XX/XX/19, the check appeared cleared in my account, so i went ahead and sent XXXX $ total through XXXX, to two different people, because XXXX $ is the max, and was planning on sending another XXXX $ the next day.

I had already sent XXXX $ and no one, not wells fargo, or XXXX XXXX, or XXXX wants to help me. the person is not answering my phone calls, and the one phone number i had blocked my number.

1251,"Thursday XX/XX/XXXX I went to my Wells Fargo branch, talked to a personal banker, and requested a wire transfer of {$9500.00} to the XXXX. He completed the form with the information he requested from me, sent it to the wire transfer department and told me it would take about a week. At XXXX we had completed the transaction. 
Thursday XX/XX/XXXX I went to the branch again and talked with the same banker. I had expected the money to have arrived in the recipients bank account. He called the wire department to check on it and told me that he thinks it takes 7 working days not calendar days. He told me the wire department said they had not had the funds returned so that was a good sign but they did not appear to know where the funds were. He said it may arrive as late as Monday XX/XX/XXXX. It did not arrive on the XX/XX/XXXX. 
Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX I talked to a banker on the phone and said I wanted to file a complaint. She said she would look into it and that they could put a trace on it if I wanted, and that usually they charge for that, but she would waive the fee. I also asked for the wire transfer fee to be returned since they had not provided the service as described. The {$35.00} wire transfer fee has been refunded. 
Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX I went into the branch again. I was concerned that Wells Fargo might not have collected all the necessary information to complete the transaction. I took the information with me and talked to a different banker suggesting that maybe the transfer failed due to incomplete information. I offered to provide additional information ( twice ). The banker did not respond but contacted the wire transfer department. She informed me that the transfer takes 8 working days and that the transaction was not initiated until the XX/XX/XXXX. This was news to me. I understood it was initiated on the XX/XX/XXXX when I requested it and the money was removed from my account. It was already the 8th day. I was told the trace would take 3 days and she would call me when the money arrived. I asked to be updated each day. I also talked to the branch manager and expressed my concerns about lack of training in the bank, lack of service, and poor processes. 
Thursday XX/XX/XXXX the banker I worked with initially emailed me, said he had escalated the complaint. He copied the branch manager and someone from the customer resolution service. I responded to all. As of end of day Monday XX/XX/XXXX neither of them contacted me. 
Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX I emailed the branch manager to escalate my complaint and ask for the name of his manager. He provided her contact details. He did not acknowledge that I had requested a refund. His message suggests he is still waiting for the transaction to occur : I will review your account tomorrow. If the funds are not available, I will contact our wire department again. 
I responded to him and his manager saying that this was unacceptable. I asked his manager if she intended to play any part in resolving the issue."

I have also already filed a complaint against them, which was closed. They are failing to help me and I am going to have to take legal action if this doesnt get resolved. For full details of the scam you can reference : Wells Fargo case number : XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, case number : XXXX I am extremely dissatisfied with Wells Fargo. You guys have failed to help me as a customer as I was a victim of this horrible XXXX scam going around. This same scam targeted many XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX customers ; however XXXX refunded their customers who were victims to the scam. You guys have failed to do so. Therefore I have no choice now but to take legal action. I am very frustrated. I have my money in your bank to be protected. And you guys are unable to do that for me. I have been a XXXX customer since 2003. I will be switching banks once all of this is resolved. 

A federal law known a Regulation E protects victims of fraudulent money transfers. Consumers who suffer unauthorized transactions are entitled to Regulation E protection, and banks are required to refund. This isnt a controversial opinion, and it was recently affirmed by the CFPB. See the link below : https : //www.consumerfinance.gov/compliance/compliance-resources/deposit-accounts-resources/electronic-fund-transfers/electronic-fund-transfers-faqs/ I refuse to let Wells Fargo fail to help me as a customer of theirs for 18 years.

1257,"It was on XX/XX/21 XXXX around XXXX or XXXX. My kid called me from his friend phone saying he got email saying he is doing wire transfer to the girls account XXXX. If hes not authorizing this, call this number. 
He didnt do it, so he called from his friend phone because his phone got hacked suddenly, and he couldnt use his phone and no one couldnt call him. He called Wells Fargo customer service to stop the transaction. Also, I called myself WellsFargo customer service and told them to stop the transaction but they told my kid they cant know if its him even though he gave his account number and social security number. Customer service told me they dont have authority to do anything but make an appointment next day on XX/XX/21 XXXX which I went. 
It was still pending on XXXX, but next morning money was gone not pending, but posted on top of XXXX dollar transaction fee. So XXXX we filed the complaint, but got denied after 10 business day. Then we escalated the case, but it got denied again. Now they re escalated higher levels or whatever. We called the fraud department asking to work with police provided her phone number police case ID and everything, but they didnt do anything but denied our case. 
I dont know why customer service doesnt have any authority to stop fraud transaction to begin with. We got email saying we are doing wire transfer, so we called they saying its not us, but they say they dont have any authority to do anything, then what is the point of customer service??? 

Also, around 2 weeks ago from XXXX, so mid to end of XXXX, he got email saying the girl tried to withdraw XXXX from his debit card, but couldnt withdraw because she didnt have correct password. So he went to branch to cancel his debit card, and request the new debit card. People at branch didnt close his account and opened new account which he should have. Instead, they said its ok as long as you get new card???? 

Customer service of Wells Fargo is beyond horrible. I cant even describe how terrible they are. 

If we didnt get money back, well find the lawyer and file a lawsuit. This is the money for my son college money. We need to get it back."

Nearly 5 minutes later I find out her XXXX was hacked and has been asking people to send her money under the email so I immediately contacted wells fargo and they couldn't do anything about it because it already went through ( but it was in less than 30 minutes and they said it takes at least 30 minutes for transactions to work on their site ). I asked if I could report the account on the other end receiving the money because they are posing as another person who isn't who they say they are and the Wells Fargo representative said no ... which didn't make sense because I have the email of the person with the XXXX account so it would be in the best interest for a report to go to WF on this Wells Fargo account that is attached to XXXX. I sent a contact form to XXXX and have not heard back. I am out {$50.00} from a person posing as my friend.

I let the seller know I sent it and then received no further communication, nor did the seller send the tickets to me. I called Wells Fargo, and finally got to their fraud department after half an hour on hold and multiple disconnections. Several bankers transferred me to other departments, etc, and I had to call multiple numbers in order to find someone that could help. It took an additional 20 minutes to file a complaint and I was given a reference number and a 10 business day waiting period."

This is the second time I 've stated my complaint and still nothing has been done about it. XXXX XXXX app is showing a balance I had on my account earlier last week. As of right now it is showing {$240.00} when in actuallity only {$12.00} is available even on the Wells Fargo app my balance is incorrect ... such a disappointment. Please fix it this time.
1261,"On XX/XX/2018, I was a part of a fraud/scam using Wells Fargo 's XXXX service. 

An individual was selling event tickets in XXXX XXXX, which were presented from XXXX. The scammer named XXXX XXXX began to share the ease and security of the transaction since XXXX was a service endorsed and backed by our banks, Wells Fargo. 

The transaction occured over the phone where the scammer provided a name, phone number, and cost of the event tickets. The amount transferred was {$400.00} for 2 tickets. 

The scammer remained on the line to verify the transfer. Once verified, he said he was now ready to initiate the online ticket transfer using an email address I provided. Then he hung up. 

After calling back, I realized my number was blocked and involved in fraud. I immediately called Wells Fargo 's fraud department to help address the situation, only to be directed to filing a case number and told an investigation would take place. 

2 weeks go by and I received a letter from Wells Fargo saying they can't do anything about the matter and will not credit the {$400.00}. 

As a Wells Fargo customer for over 20+ years, the customer service experience and protection protocol for customers in these fraud situations is an absolute mess. Countless calls for help has resulted in nothing. Ultimately resulting in a process to take my banking elsewhere."
1262,"On XX/XX/2019 I initiated a transfer of {$1500.00} from one bank account ( Bank 1- XXXX XXXX  ) to  another ( Bank 2-Wells Fargo ). I received an email from Bank 2 confirming the transfer. 


On XX/XX/2019, I received an email that Bank 2 had closed my account. I called and asked their customer service why it was closed and I was told it was closed by a system error and that my attempted transfer would "" bounce back '' to my Bank 1 account within two business days. 


Well, it didn't. 
Bank 1 's statement lists the {$1500.00} withdraw by Bank 2. Since my account with Bank 2 was closed before the transfer hit, it does not show any record of the {$1500.00}. 


I filed a claim with Bank 1, and they told me there is nothing they can do because I authorized the transfer. I filed a claim with Bank 2, and they told me there was no error on their part. 


Note : I transferred the money via XXXX, the in-app transfer service. I verified the account numbers, so I did not accidentally send this money to someone else 's account. I have all the documents acquired thus far. I tried to contact XXXX and they told me that if I used XXXX in my bank 's mobile app ( which I did ) and need service, I have to contract my bank ( which I already tried )."
1264,"On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX am I recieved a call from ( XXXX ) XXXX ( wells fargo ). I spoke with the person on the phone who claimed to be from wells fargo XXXX department. They stated that a XXXX XXXX was attempting to transfer {$1800.00} from my account to his through XXXX. The man I spoke with instructed me to transfer my money ( {$880.00} ) to myself through XXXX using my phone number ( XXXX ) XXXX to cancel the pending transaction. I complied as the number was wells fargo 's actual customer support phone number. Once I submitted the transaction it immediately was completed but the money did not re-appear in my account as the man on the phone had stated it would. I later discovered that my phone number was no longer registered to my account and was instead registered to ( I believe ) this man 's account. So despite my intention to send the money back to myself it had instead been sent to this man 's account. I immediately called wells fargo and submitted a claim. 9 business days later wells fargo had completed the case but would not inform me of their decision. 5 business days later I recieved a letter in the mail from Wells Fargo stating that they would do nothing to return the money back to my account stating that the transaction had been completed as intended. They instructed me to contact the person that I had "" sent the money to '' under the premise that I intentionally sent the money to them as a transaction for a product/service despite me clearly stating that it was intended to go back to myself. I never broke any codes of conduct with Wells Fargo but they refuse to refund the money back to me. I appreciate the help and look forward to your response."
1265,On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email asking if I would like to have my vehicle wrapped for advertising purposes and received {$2000.00} a month. I stated I stated yes and asked what the requirements werequirements were. They said that they would send me a check for {$4900.00} and I would send {$4400.00} To the wrapping company and keep {$500.00} as my 1st installment. I received the check in 2 days and deposited into my Wells Fargo checking account. I received another email 's telling me to use XXXX to send the {$4400.00} to the wrapping company. As this was the 1st time I was using XXXX I was only to able to send {$500.00}. I was directed to send the {$500.00} to a XXXX XXXX And use a wire transfer to send the remaining money. I did send {$500.00} to XXXX XXXX But I started becoming suspicious and did not send the wired transfer the same date. The more I asked about the wrapping company the more suspicious I came and Icontacted Wells Fargo and they told me that it was a scam that they had run across before and cancelled the wire transfer. I filed a fraud claim with Wells Fargo fraud department And explained the circumstances. I was issued claim number XXXX. I received a letter approximately 2 weeks later stating that my claim had been rejected because the money had gone through XXXX with no problem and I was the one that had initiated the transfer. I have just got done talking to the fraud department again at Wells Fargo and they said there was nothing they could do. They are a multi XXXX dollar company and I and I am a retired pensioner living on social security and a retirement. {$500.00} is a lot of money to me.. I am upset because they publish using XXXX knowing that people can not get their money back From them. I know Wells Fargo is insured through FDIC And {$500.00} is a drop in the bucket to them. After going on the sales website I have seen numerous complaints basically the same as mine dealing with frauds and scams. Several people had contacted you and had gotten results and this is the reason I am contacting you and hoping that at whatever you do might push Wells Fargo into returning my money. Thank you very much
1267,"Hello, For over a year now, I have been trying to trace a check or international wire transfer, coming from XXXX to my US Wells Fargo account between Fall XXXX XX/XX/2006, for an amount between {$10000.00} and {$15000.00}. 
I have filed 3 inquiries with Wells Fargo. None were followed trough or resolved.

I understand an archival search, for which I am ready to pay for, is necessary. But I can not get Wells Fargo to do it.

Can you help, please?

Looking forward to your reply.

Thank you.

1268,XXXX XXXX transfer {$250.00} from Wells Fargo to XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX Fraudulent end user did not provide product. Realized it was a scam and contacted Wells Fargo within the hour. No response from scammer regarding goods. Wells Fargo not backing fee even though we have been clients for 20 years with excellent credit.
1270,"Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), Regulation E. On XX/XX/2021, I was caught up in a check fraud scam and I was scammed out of {$4000.00} total from my checkings account. The check was written to me by the scammer and sent via XXXX, who had added me on XX/XX/2021, explaining how they wanted to take care of me financially, with the check bank being "" XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX '' with a total of {$4700.00} and I was told that {$700.00} would be compensation for doing menial tasks of transferring the majority of the money to the designated accounts instructed. The check was deposited by me on XX/XX/2021, and since {$400.00} was immediately present in my account I was under the impression that the check was legitimate. I discovered that the check was fake only after the money had been transferred because of how persistent and aggressive the scammer was. {$3400.00} was scammed from me via XXXX with four transactions : 1 transaction being {$400.00} on XX/XX/2021, and 3 transactions being {$1000.00} each on XX/XX/2021. The other {$600.00} was scammed from me via XXXX on XX/XX/2021 ; this was only one transaction. On XX/XX/2021, I made a claim with Wells Fargo about the scam in an attempt to obtain my money back. The XXXX claim for {$3400.00} was made on XX/XX/2021, but I was instructed by a Wells Fargo representative to make another claim for XXXX since the transaction was not complete on my statement record until XX/XX/2021. On XX/XX/2021, XXXX was also contacted about the scam and my XXXX account was frozen. On XX/XX/2021, a claim for {$600.00} was made. On XX/XX/2021, I made a claim with "" CFPB '' to ensure that I would get my lump sum back. On XX/XX/2021, my "" CFPB '' complaint was closed since Wells Fargo responded. On XX/XX/2021, {$600.00} was returned to my account. On XX/XX/2021, I was called to ask the status of these two claims since I was never provided an update : the XXXX claim was deemed to be non-refundable since the transaction was made by me and not by someone else through hacking ; On XX/XX/2021, I was met with the same response meaning Wells Fargo is not complying with Regulation E of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and only contacted the scammer to get the money refunded rather than reimbursing me. I believe I am still owed my lump sum back because of the "" Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) specifically Regulation E '' since I was convinced thinking that this was a legitimate interaction and was "" promised '' a specific amount, but in reality, none of it was true. I would just like the remaining {$3400.00} provided back to me since it is such a large amount to me. My occurrence is similar to XXXX XXXX 's occurrence yet she was provided her money back but I was not."
1271,"On Friday, XX/XX/2020 I used my mobile banking app with Wells Fargo to deposit a check for {$1400.00}. This was my normal depositing behavior while working for my old company. Over a month later XX/XX/2020, the exact amount of {$1400.00} was missing from my account leaving me with a negative balance. Upon noticing the error, I called up Wells Fargo and tried to connect with a customer service agent to figure out what is going on. By this time, I am no longer working for the company the original check was issued from and I am now working 5-6 hours away from that area. After a few days, calls and even trips to a local branch I was told that my claim was sent to investigations and that I would be updated personally as soon as possible. Days go by once again before I take the imitative to call once more and connect with the investigation department who informed me that my claim was closed and a letter would be sent out stating that there was a duplicate item from another bank and that I could not be helped. Days pass by with more calls in-between but due to the case being closed no one was able to escalate or work on the matter. The letter I was dated XX/XX/2020, and stated that on XX/XX/2020, I made an electronic deposited of {$1400.00} through mobile remote deposit. That information is completely true and was my usual order of business. The letter continued to say that the same item was deposited a second time through another channel and as a result on XX/XX/2020, they deducted {$1400.00} from my checking account. 
Their letter does not prove or even go into more detail as to where and when the duplicate item was withdrawn from. 
The letter ends with a Reference # : XXXX Confused by the open and closed case with what seems like no investigation nor facts I called the Bank back and used the reference number and was told eventually told the duplicate transaction was from a Federal Reserve Bank, a bank I have never used nor think I can use. This confused me and left me helpless as Wells Fargo would no longer assist me with this error and kept referencing the closed case, a case mind you that was open and shut with what looks like no real information. 
The company was no help even though I tried repeatedly to work and assist them with anything they needed to complete the recovery of my fund to my account that they wrongfully withdrew because they gave someone else money in a bank that I never visited, in a city that I was no longer in from a company I was no longer working for."
1272,"It started XX/XX/2021 when I looked at my account and found it near zero. I called Wells Fargo to find out what happened to my money and they said some women claiming to be me needed the money immediately for her XXXX XXXX. I told them it was not me nor do I have a XXXX to pay. They said Dont worry we will recall it. Then they said the other bank XXXX XXXX would handle the issue. Next, they refused to send it back and said I had to report it to the police which I had already done. Again Im trying to get back money left to me from my XXXX XXXX XXXX months ago. To make a long story short Wells Fargo needs to replace money they gave to someone and lock them up for this crime. I was send a letter and the response from them was I stole my own money. 
Wells Fargo acknowledged the fraudulent activity and credited back most of the {$25.00}. Transactions but they still refuse to give back my {$12000.00}. and its been 4 months now that they have refused to return the money. Please have them fill an insurance claim or something or whatever to return my deposit."
1284,"XX/XX/2021 - I ( we ) have ben with Wells Fargo for many years. Up until now they seemed to be good to us, just a bank I guess. Recently I ( we ) sent money to our niece. This wasnt the first time and we have never had a problem using XXXX before. So we sent her {$500.00} I couldnt get ahold of her to confirm if she received it. When I did get a hold of her XX/XX/2021 to confirm she said she did not get it. So I called Wells Fargo and they opened a case. Case XXXX. I was told it looked like it was complete but something was not right, it was pending for some reason. I was told it could take up to 12 days to investigate but should only be a day or so. So I thought I would delete my niece and add her back in, sometimes this works for other stuff. So I did. Still nothing in my nieces account. I called back and was told it might take 12 days. I waited and called back in 12 days XX/XX/2021. I was told the case was closed, the transaction was processed as requested. NO, NO it was not. My niece still did not have the money. The case was reopened and I was told it could take another 12 days. I feel like I was being put off. When I called the lady on the phone treated me like I was doing something wrong and wanted to talk to my husband. Neither one of us was very happy about that. She kept saying the email address the money was sent to was not the email address we could see on our end. She said the money went to a different email address than what we told her, so I took a picture with my cell phone even though my husband read her what we were looking at she kept telling us that is not the address she was seeing, so again we waited another 12 days only to get a letter stating the case was closed again. This isnt right, its not {$25.00} dollars, its {$500.00}. Wells Fargo basically told me to try to get it back myself. I did send an email to the address she said the money went to and requested the money back. I did not get a reply. I knew I wouldn't, but I tried. My niece has since closed her Wells Fargo account. n Once this is all settled, we will do the same."
1286,"On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX hrs., I logged onto my personal computer and XXXX XXXX XXXX It brought up several possible sights and I clicked on XXXX XXXX Web Site. My account popped up and showed my last transactions/purchases made. Due to an e-mail I received the night before, which indicated that a package from XXXX was attempted to be delivered but no one was available to accept the package, I went to a tab that appeared on this XXXX web page that said customer service. An XXXX toll free number popped up and I dialed it. A gentlemen answered the phone, XXXX Customer Service how may I help you. I inquired regarding the attempted XXXX delivery because I was home the entire day before. The male identified himself as XXXX XXXX, a customer service rep. He asked me to hold briefly, came back on the phone and stated that he did not see any attempted delivery, although inquired if I had made any recent purchases of a large sum. Upon inquiry, he stated there was over a {$10000.00} pending purchase for materials that related to XXXX. I stated I made no such purchase and that it was definitely a fraudulent purchase. He reviewed my recent transactions and they were exactly the same as the purchases that I had made and were looking at on my XXXX screen. He stated he would put a hold on this transaction and indicated he believed my account was hacked. He further stated they were experiencing a lot of fraudulent transactions on Wells Fargo accounts. At no time did I state I had a Wells Fargo account, although he clearly knew I had one. He then provided me with XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX for any future referrals. He recommended that he transfer me to the Wells Fargo Fraud Unit to report said claim and 3 way telephone conference me in with an individual who identified himself as XXXX XXXX from the Wells Fargo Fraud Unit. Mr. XXXX then exited the call stating that the Wells Fargo Fraud Unit would be able to look into the situation. 

Mr. XXXX advised he was a member of the Wells Fargo Fraud Management Team advising that they had been experiencing a lot of fraudulent claims with the Wells Fargo XXXX in The XXXX XXXX. He stated that their unit believed there was a compromised employee at the branch and they had been working for weeks on attempting to identify the employee. He stated that my IP address on my computer had to be compromised and advised me to run a security scan on my system. I performed said scan with XXXX XXXX XXXX. He also recommended that I download a software program called XXXX so he could look into my system for any compromises to identify the IP address where my system was being compromised. At all times I believed this individual was from Wells Fargo Fraud Unit. He said he was going to scan my system in an effort to identify the IP address where my system was compromised. He asked me to go to the bottom of my screen and type the word SCAN into my system which would allow him to remotely scan the system. He indicated that it would take a while and that he would call me back later that day. After several hours, I received a call from the number he said he would call me from which was XXXX XXXX ( XXXX New Jersey # XXXX. He telephoned me four times later that afternoon and early evening, although I did not answer all his calls. He also sent me text msgs. and left me several voice msgs on my cell #. I do have these text and voice msgs. 
On Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX at about XXXX hrs. he telephoned my cell again and stated that I needed to allow him to keep checking my computer system. He also wanted to know why I had a large sum of money in my checking account that he could see. Again, because he appeared to know this information, I truly believed he worked for Wells Fargo Fraud. At advised him I was about to refinance my home. He very calmly stated I need your help in identifying this person at the Wells Fargo XXXX in The XXXX and stated he was going to set up a dummy account and dummy wire transfer from my account to this dummy account, although everything would be a shell for them to utilize catching the employee from inside the Wells Fargo XXXX He further stated that the money would not actually leave the Bank and would be temporarily shown as a withdrawal but placed back into the bank w/in the end of the business day. He came up with the amount of {$48000.00}. Again, I believed he was being truthful. He stated he would be sending me an e-mail instruction with all the information to perform the dummy Wire Transfer and that he wanted me to take the instructions to the branch on XXXX XXXX in The XXXX  and ask them to make the wire transfer. On Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX hrs. I went to the XXXX Wells Fargo XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and handed the instructions for the wire transfer to a representative at the Branch. The Representative identified herself as XXXX XXXX. Ms. XXXX asked what the wire transfer was for and I stated a start up import/export business, just as directed by XXXX XXXX. No other questions were asked of me by Representative XXXX XXXX. She typed up the Wire Transfer and asked me to sign off on the appropriate form. At about XXXX hrs. Mr. XXXX telephoned me again and asked if the Transfer was completed. I advised him it was. He stated he was still running a scan on my computer, although he could not locate any hacking information as of yet. He remained in contact with me for several hours that afternoon. On the same evening I checked my banking information and did not see that the money was placed back into my account. 

I stopped the scanning on my computer and did another XXXX search for XXXX. In logging onto my account I had difficulties locating the Customer Service Tab. Late in that evening I telephoned the number on the back of my Wells Fargo debit card and asked if there were any recent transactions on my account, especially for {$10000.00}. I was advised there was not. I advised the gentlemen that I believed I may have been the victim of a fraudulent scheme from the day before and provided a brief synopsis of the situation and he advised me to go back to the bank the following morning and file a report at the same branch of a possible fraud on my account. On Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX, I telephoned the same number on the back of my card and stated that I believed I had just been scammed out of {$48000.00} by wire fraud from the previous afternoon. He also directed me to go back to the same branch where I had make the wire fraud transaction the day before and report a Fraud Scheme to the branch in The XXXX XXXX. 

At about XXXX hrs. on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX, I responded back to the same branch and contacted the same Representative, XXXX XXXX. I advised her that I was in the afternoon before and performed a wire transfer that I believed was part of an elaborate fraud scheme as the money was no longer in my account. I explained the entire scheme to Ms. XXXX and she immediately picked up the phone on her desk and telephoned the Wire Fraud Unit for Wells Fargo. She advised them of the prior days Wire Transfer I conducted and asked them to terminate the transaction as it was a fraud scheme. XXXX XXXX Wire Transfer. She was apparently advised that they would have to send a WIRE RECALL for the funds to be seized by the XXXX bank. They provided her and me with case # XXXX as the case number assigned. They advised the case would be upgraded to an Investigator. The Investigator from the fraud unit would immediately send out a RECALL request to the bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and request for the funds to be returned due to fraud. While she was on this call, I also telephoned the number on the Wire Transfer Fund form and spoke with an Investigator, XXXX XXXX, regarding the situation. Ms. XXXX stated, based on the recall they should be able to get the money back and should be able to have it resolved, hopefully by Friday, since the case was being escalated to an Investigator. 

Additionally, on Thursday evening I telephoned XXXX after having to enter a security code on their home page at which time they called me. 

On Friday morning, XX/XX/XXXX, I telephoned the Wire Fraud Unit regarding any updates on my claim. After answering several questions, I was transferred to another department in the Fraud Unit and my call was disconnected. I did not receive a return call, so at approximately XXXX hrs. I returned to the Wells Fargo XXXX on XXXX XXXX to ascertain if any updates were available. I contacted Ms. XXXX again who telephoned the Wire Transfer Fraud Unit who advised her they had not heard from the beneficiary bank ( ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and that the bank had five ( 5 ) days to respond to their request at which time they would initiate another WIRE RECALL request and continue to do so every 5 days for 15 days. I also inquired with MsXXXX XXXX about the Wire Transfer form since the form advises on the specific line item that the funds would not be available until XX/XX/XXXX. This same information was pointed out to me on the evening before when I went to the XXXX XXXX, XXXX Sheriffs Department and spoke with Deputy XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX advised that they could take a complaint for XXXX, although it would not do any good as it was out of their jurisdiction and all up to Wells Fargo to have the funds retracted. She directed me to file a complaint with the FBI, WWW.IC3.gov unit on-line at IC3.gov as my best solution to resolve this issue. A complaint was therefore not documented by this Agency. I then directed Ms XXXX to the Wire Transfer Form again which states under this line item that the funds would be available on XX/XX/XXXX. While at the bank I had MsXXXX XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo Rep ) contact the Wire Fraud Unit on two other occasions over a period of almost 2 hours to inquire about what additional action they could take to seize the funds or have them retracted. All they would say is that a report was taken and a RECALL notice sent to the beneficiary bank and they had to wait 5 days for a response. They would send a RECALL to the bank every 5 days. I felt that due to the urgency of this situation and that time was of the essence that further action should be taken, although I was advised that they were doing everything possible to recover the funds. I later learned that this was truly not the case. 

During the course of that day I telephoned the Wells Fargo Fraud Unit at XXXX to see if there were any updates on their ability to recall the funds. In each instance I was advised that they were awaiting a response on the RECALL. I asked why they couldnt call the bank to put them on notice that a RECALL on the Wire Transfer was sent and that the transaction was part of an elaborate fraud scheme. I was advised that they could not contact the XXXX  bank. On the same date at about XXXX hrs. I telephoned the Wire Fraud Dept. again to inquire about the status. In doing so, I spoke to a XXXX XXXX from the Wire Fraud Unit who advised that the case was upgraded and a new case # XXXX  XXXX was assigned to my complaint. This was now the 3rd case # I was assigned from Wells Fargo Fraud Unit. He advised that the RECALL msg was sent on XX/XX/XXXX and that wire transfers typically take 3-5 days to make it to the XXXX  bank, especially in foreign transfers, and that they believed that the funds would be recovered since I reported the incident so quickly. He advised that the process was that Wire Transfers and Wire Transfer requests went through a system called XXXX XXXX out of N.Y. and then to an XXXX bank who would forward the requests on to the XXXX XXXX This was the first time that any explanation was provided to me. In fact, every time I inquired, which I did numerous times, no one would explain the process. 

On the evening before, Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX, I went on line to XXXX again and opened up the XXXX web page that popped up. In doing so, I was unable to find a customer service tab but located a tab that said need help. After clicking on this tab, another tab popped up that directed me to enter a security code that was sent to my cell number. I entered the code and sent the msg. back. About a minute later I received a telephone call from XXXX. I answered the phone and the person on the other line identified herself as XXXX from XXXX. I explained the situation to her and she upgraded my complaint to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX advised that XXXX did not have a Customer Service number listed on their Official site, although he also advised that there are numerous bogus web sites when you XXXX XXXX and they are identical images of their Official Web site and are very difficult to tell the difference, but are placed there by scam and/or fraud artists. 

On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, I telephoned the Wire Fraud Unit on multiple occasions, spoke to several different individuals, who advised that my complaint had been upgraded. Although in each instance I was advised that the only thing they could do was to wait until they heard from the XXXX bank. See Attached Wire Transfer. I advised each Representative that it was believed that they would her something by Friday, Saturday at the latest, but that no news was being received. I was then advised that since it was the weekend that they would probably definitely her something by Monday. 

On Monday XX/XX/XXXX I telephoned the Wire Fraud Unit several times for updates, although in each instance I was advised that they were still waiting a response from the RECALL. At approximately XXXX hrs., date, I telephoned the XXXX XXXX XXXX again and reached an individual who identified herself as XXXX XXXX Upon questioning her extensively, she advised that I could call Wells Fargo Fraud at XXXX as my case had been escalated. She also provided XXXX XXXX # XXXX as the verification # on the recall. She confirmed that Wells Fargo forwarded a RECALL that the transfer was part of a fraud scheme. She also located XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX telephone numbers for the bank and recommended that I telephone them. These numbers were : XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. She indicated that they could not call the XXXXy bank but that I could try and hopefully one of the numbers would allow me to talk to someone. I dialed these numbers repeatedly for several hours but could not get anyone to answer the phone. 

On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, approximately XXXX hrs. I telephoned the XXXX bank at XXXX and spoke to a representative at the bank. This female only spoke XXXX which made conversation very difficult as I am not bilingual. I stated Fraud to her several times when she asked me to hold and transferred me to another person. This person was bilingual although her XXXX was broken and very difficult to understand. I explained that a Fraudulent Wire Transfer was sent to her bank under the name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and provided the account # on the Wire Transfer Form. She advised that I would have to send them a letter detailing the transaction before they could do anything. I advised her a Wire RECALL was sent to them from Wells Fargo Bank in the XXXX She seemed to understand but repeated that I needed to send them correspondence. I then asked about sending an e-mail to them and she provided me an e-mail address that I reviewed with her at least a half dozen times to verify its accuracy. She confirmed that the address was correct and I did send an e-mail, although it was returned as undeliverable. What was interesting to me was that on XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX in the XXXX Department by the name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who indicated that she was bi-lingual and would have been able to communicate effectively with the bank days before, but she indicated i was against Wells Fargo policy for her to do that. 

On the evening of Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX at about XXXX hours I spoke to a female from the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX, XXXX Department, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who stated she was in XXXX, Oregon. She confirmed that the XXXX bank notified Wells Fargo that the RECALLS were received and forwarded on to the XXXX bank and they acknowledged the RECALLS. As you could imagine, this whole event was very traumatic and with all the telephone calls and people I spoke to it was becoming difficult to keep names, dates and events in sequence even though I was documenting everything. I believe that it was XXXX who indicated that the notes in their system reflected that the funds had been removed from the beneficiary account holders name. I asked how this could happen when they already had two ( 2 ) wire RECALL notices sent and received before this date. She apologized and said there was nothing they could do. 

On Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, at about XXXX hrs. I telephoned the Wire Fraud Unit to inquire about the status of said RECALL. I was not given any information and requested to speak to a supervisor. The individual from the XXXX XXXX Department advised again that the case was being escalated and that I was being transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was transferred and a subject answered the phone. He asked if I was XXXX XXXX and I responded affirmatively. The other bank representative advised they would be leaving the telephone call. I asked this individual if they were XXXX since it sounded like a male voice. They stated no, this was XXXX. I stated that I was told I was being transferred to XXXX. The subject stated that their name was XXXX. I again advised that I was told I was being transferred to XXXX. XXXX then stated this is XXXX. I was stunned and asked what is your name. The subject stated that technically their name was XXXX, but they go by the name XXXX. I immediately questioned whom I was talking too and XXXX indicated that they are XXXX but refers to themselves as XXXX. I questioned him again and asked to be transferred to their supervisor. I was advised that there supervisor was not available and I would receive a returned telephone call from their supervisor, XXXX XXXX I was also advised that XXXX XXXX XXXX was XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to reach someone from the Executive Department on four ( 4 ) separate occasions, although I consistently became disconnected from my telephone calls to receive an update. 

Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX XXXX XXXX asked her if she was bi-lingual and she stated yes. I asked why she could not be used as a resource/tool in these types of situations to make a telephone call to banks with XXXX  speaking people to put them on notice that a Fraudulent transfer had occurred and a RECALL had been sent apparently two times now from my phone call on Monday with XXXX who advised that another RECALL was sent on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX. She just stated it was against Wells Fargo policy. She advised that she was escalating my complaint further up in their Executive Dept. I also spoke with XXXX XXXX from the branch office in the XXXX  XXXX, who advised that she escalated the complaint on XX/XX/XXXX, Friday, and a new case # XXXX was assigned to my situation. 

On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX I telephoned the Wire Fraud Unit again and spoke to XXXX XXXX Department from the Executive Department Team. She advised that the case was escalated to XXXX XXXX, XXXX in the XXXX Department. She took all my information and assigned me a new case # XXXX. She said he hadnt contacted me yet because the situation is still being reviewed and that he would be in touch with me in a couple days. To date, I have yet to receive any telephone calls from XXXX XXXX nor anyone else regarding the review of this loss of {$48000.00}. 

Between Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX, and Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX I received numerous telephone calls and text msgs. from Mr. XXXX XXXX XXXX the scammer identifying himself as a XXXX from Wells Fargo Fraud Unit Management Team ). I have those text msgs. and voice msgs. on my phone. I did not respond to any of these calls as directed by Wells Fargo Fraud Unit. It was there opinion that he was just trying to keep communication going since the transfer had not taken place yet and that it was a good sign that the money was not actually deposited yet., a RECALL was sent on the morning of Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX, the morning following the afternoon of Wednesday when this whole nightmare started and supposedly a second RECALL was sent again on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

It is my opinion that a simple phone call by Wells Fargo Fraud Unit by a bi-lingual employee, which they apparently have, could have created a totally different outcome in this situation and that the beneficiary bank could have at least froze the account pending further investigation and evaluation. It is also my opinion that if the FBI would have gotten involved and made a telephone inquiry that the bank would have been aware that the account and the transfer were all part of a fraud scheme. Last, I went to another Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Where I had resided until just recently and inquired with a banker representative there as to their protocol in processing Wire Transfers. This particular representative was sick to her stomach that no questioning of me was performed by the other bank. The first thing she questioned was the printout I handed her with all the directions on them regarding the Wire Transfer. She immediately asked me If I had ever met this individual who requested the transaction and I stated no. She asked if the other banker asked this question and I said no. She immediately stated that she would have told me it was a fraud scheme and to not make the transfer. She then asked if I had ever sent money to this person before. She then asked how I knew this person and how did I talk to the person. I advised her that it all started through XXXX and XXXX referred me to Mr. XXXX who identified himself as a Manager in the Wells Fargo Fraud Unit. She just stated that she believed that there was due diligence that should be exercised by all employers and especially in large Wire Transfers. She further stated that all bankers should ask several questions due to the high volume and sophisticated nature of all the Fraud Schemes occurring today. 

Unfortunately for me, Wells Fargo was unsuccessful in recovering the majority of my life savings I was going to utilize to live in retirement. I do believe that Wells Fargo did not perform their due diligence and did not inquire appropriately at the onset to ensure that the transaction was being done voluntarily and not part of a fraud scheme. I do believe that a couple simple questions by the institution would have red flagged this entire scheme and I would not have been further victimized. Obviously, I am very disappointed that I cant even receive a telephone call from the FBI. I did telephone the FBI in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, XXXX only to be transferred in an automated system that disconnected my telephone call every time. I also telephoned the FBI in XXXX, Md and again became disconnected. I did telephone the FBI XXXX in XXXX, Pa on Wednesday afternoon, XX/XX/XXXX, and spoke to a male individual there who stated he would have an experienced Agent call me either by the end of the day or the next morning. Again, I have yet to have anyone respond or a response from my IC3 Fraud Complaint on the FBI Fraud government web page. Although Im sure there are a lot of Fraud Scams in our country, I believe that the timeliness I identified this scam and my immediate actions to have the funds seized/recovered should have been much more successful-even as was stated to me by several Wells Fargo employees. I have been a Wells Fargo customer now for over 30 years and have always trusted their processes. It would be honorable for Wells Fargo to see their lack of due diligence and provide a full refund of my loss. As a large financial institution making hundreds of millions of dollars, I believe that the right thing to do would be to compensate me. Obviously, some form of reasonable compensation in my opinion would be the professional thing to do. I have reached out to two attorneys and am awaiting further direction and guidance. I am also in the process of contacting the Florida XXXX of the Attorney General to see if they are capable of providing and further assistance. I have also received resistence in being given the CEO of Wells Fargo, XXXX XXXX, although eventually did obtain same. I will be forwarding him correspondence at XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Ca. XXXX and plan to reach out to see if he would consider personally getting involved in this matter. 

I am praying everyday that Wells Fargo will help me in some manner. I can be reached at the address and telephone number listed below. Further, there are several attachments of records to this complaint process. I look forward to an amicable and conciliatory resolution to this matter. Although, with all the phone calls and contacts I have already made, it seems apparent that follow up calls are not going to be conducted by Wells Fargo.

1287,"I used XXXX through my Wells Fargo account to pay a person with an account at XXXX XXXX. This person using their XXXX account committed fraud and stole {$200.00} from me. 

My complaint is against Wells Fargo, XXXX and XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo and XXXX own XXXX. 

My case is EXACTLY as those described in the recent XXXX XXXX article on XXXX and their significant issues with fraud. XXXX  : XXXX On the night of XX/XX/2018, I sent money to a person advertising concert tickets on XXXX. I paid them {$200.00} through XXXX on the Wells Fargo website. The person I paid had a XXXX account linked to their XXXX account. The tickets were counterfeit. 

I immediately called Wells Fargo. The Wells Fargo website listed the transaction as "" Pending. '' The Wells Fargo representative said that is incorrect ; the transaction was instant and nothing can be done. The WF representative then told me the XXXX account which had committed the fraud was linked to a XXXX XXXX account. The email associated with the XXXX account at XXXX is XXXX I have called Wells Fargo, XXXX and XXXX. They refuse to explore or investigate this case of fraud. Wells Fargo and XXXX say it is XXXX 's responsibility, XXXX says it is the bank 's. The joke is the banks own XXXX. None of them have any interest in resolving this issue. NONE OF THE COMPANIES HAVE A MEANS TO FILE A DISPUTE, COMPLAINT OR FRAUD. How can that be? 

XXXX and it's owners, Wells Fargo and XXXX have repeatedly told the press they will do everything they can to help reduce this significant fraud problem. Yet all three have systematic procedures that prevent just that. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"
1288,"I used Wellsfargo  XXXX  to send money to my mother. I wrote her name and typed in a phone number to transfer the money. Turns out the name and number did n't match, because there was a typo in the phone number. The money was still sent. I immediately called them right after the transfer before it even completed. They waited two weeks before giving me a resolution and just told me according to their research the funds are now gone, and even though the name and the phone number did n't match Wellsfargo still transferred the funds and there is n't anything they can do about it, unless the person voluntary gives it back???
Institution : Wellsfargo Application :  XXXX  Amount : {$500.00} Transfer :   XXXX   XXXX  , 2017 Action :   XXXX   XXXX   2017 - opened claim   XXXX   XXXX  , 2017 - reopened claim Spoke to a banker, he 's trying to file another claim to the internal resolution team and advocate for me I forced them to reopen the claim after they closed it, when they told me they tried "" calling '' the other financial institution and that was it. Even if I was take this person to small claims, Wellsfargo will not provide me with documentation of the information of where the money was transfer to so I can take the person to court. So long story, short they are leaving me high and dry. They told me to handle it myself but even then they are not providing me with much information to handle the situation myself.
The general attitude was tough luck to me. I have a personal banker that I encounter that is trying to advocate for me but it seems bleak. I do n't know why they sent my money even if the number did n't MATCH THE NAME!"
1292,XX/XX/19 I sent {$250.00} via XXXX through wellsfargo and within 5 mins I realized it was a scam and called Wells Fargo to stop the transaction. They opened a case and told me they would investigate and sent me a letter that theres nothing they could do.
1293,"My mother 's phone number was linked to two different Wells Fargo bank accounts. One account was my mother 's and the was a different WF consumer ). This should never have happened or we should have been made aware of this after updating the phone number in WF app ).

THE PROBLEM : I transferred {$120.00} from my WF checking account into my mother 's WF checking account, on XX/XX/2018 using her phone number and XXXX. The money went into the other consumer 's WF account because ; according to the Fraud Representative, "" The system was possibly stumped and did not know which account ( phone number ) to deposit the funds, but this was obviously a glitch in the software that should've never happened. '' I have filed multiple claims and made several calls with WF as follows : 1 ) XX/XX/XXXX Initial complaint-I was referred to XXXX Customer service and told WF has nothing to do with 3rd party apps ( that they sponsor ) XXXX 's voice prompt referred back to WF.

2 ) XXXXInitial Fraud claim - XXXX/Ref XXXX. Results - I was told this was not fraud because I mistakenly sent to other consumer. Customer service rep did not capture my complaint accurately. After explaining, I was told the info was totally incorrect, updated, and resent for investigation with up to 10 days for results. 
3. ) Second claim ( XXXX ) - After hearing from no one, I called to follow up on claim status. I was provided the same script for the initial denial reasons and was told there was no update provided and no case was being invested. Open ed second claim - XXXX or XXXX ( provided the latter in a later conversation with customer service rep ). During this call the Fraud Representative "" dug deep '' in gathering information, acknowledged this would be fraud because 1. he wasn't expecting money, and 2. It was not in his name. Results:1 ) Claim opened 2 ) accounts linked for investigator 3 ) A pledge was placed on other consumer 's account 4. ) I was told I should hear something in few days and call back if not.

3 ) Third claim - XXXX - Called WF to follow up with claim, as suggested. Again, Customer service read me the initial denial script for XX/XX/XXXX claim ). After a little back and forth, I was transferred to the Fraud department. I was told claim denied bc of "" previous transactions. '' being good. At this time, I asked to be transferred to higher management. Call dropped. 
4 ) XXXX Called back. I was transferred to multiple departments before I was finally asked to file a Money movement claim bc of the phone number issue on WF side. 
5 ) XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX. File claim. When Rep ws reading back my issue, he said, "" XXXX app used and funds were sent to wrong number ). '' NOT AGAIN?! I re explained this was not the case. I had the correct number but it was linked to 2 accounts, by no fault of my own. Results : I received a call from XXXX XXXX XXXX and he told me to request money back from other consumer cause there was nothing WF could do because I used XXXX. He did give me another option of suing other consumer for money in Civil court. I AGAIN explained the situation. XXXX said he made notes to the claim and would continue to monitor the situation. 
6 ) I have no faith. I called WF to get an update XXXX. Surprise- I was read the same script from the initial denial. I immediately asked for the Fraud dept. Who told me nothing was decided in the second claim that they had 13 days. I aprised XXXX of the information that I had before she placed me on hold to "" look further. '' She referred me back to XXXX in XXXX XXXX. Call dropped. 
7 ) XXXX I called Customer Service and was on hold for an hour and 13 minutes, while XXXX attempted to connect me to XXXX XXXX, before he came back and told me it was the end of the day and they were possibly gone but he would send an email, on my behalf, for XXXX to call me back. 
There was 1Fraud Representative that did her due diligence to review the information, WF seems to show no interest in my concerns. In an effort to 'pass the blame ' and be done. WF seems to want to make this about "" using a third party app, XXXX '' and not take responsibility for the mistakes made on their end, by their system. The issue began at home-WF Online Banking. Why is WF accountable? 
1. ) My mom 's phone number should not have been linked to any other person 's account. With the rise in technology, money apps will be used more and more by consumer, like me. Email addresses and phone numbers are critical as they are the gateway to transactions in and out of banking transactions. When my mom ( or anyone ) updated her account with a new phone number and/ or email address, safeguards should have been in place to make sure NO ONE else 's private, personal account information was linked to it. I was told, by customer service, there are such safeguards - I guess this was a "" one off. '' 2. ) A deposit in my mother 's name, should not have cleared to someone else 's account.

3. ) Since all ( 3 ) are WF accounts ( verified and located ), why is it such a hassle for WF to send me my money back, when the Fraud Dept. already confirmed/identified the flaw in WF software ( 2 accounts / 1 phone number ) and allegedly linked all accounts in their system.

The Fraud Representative stated the person investigating could easily identify the obvious "" glitch '' and I should have my money back soon. Allegedly, a "" pledge '' was placed for the monies that were incorrectly deposited into the other person 's account ( which Fraud was able to located/verify based in the name from XXXX app that I provided and number ), because my mom 's name did show on the deposit and the ststem glitch. So, where is my money? 
Note : I was told the fraud claim was closed because the investigation showed no problems with "" previous monthly transactions '' sent via XXXX media, to my mom 's account. This makes me question how much effort was put into this "" investigation? '' This should have at least raised the question, What changed? 
Did the investigator completely overlook the relevant information allegedly provided by the Fraud Representative ( i.e., the linked accounts, the 2 accounts / 1 number, the phone number updated to mom 's account and date, or the name on the transaction )?

After two unsuccessful fraud claims, I submitted a money movement claim and still no results. I would like WF to return my {$120.00} from this other consumer 's WF account ( identified ). There was nothing done incorrectly with the XXXX app. ( as mentioned, I used several times prior ). This was an error with 2 accounts linked to same phone number in WF system."
1294,Wells Fargo account has been updated account numbers and overdraft fees over and over also payments are not being paid on time so credit card limit has been decreased for that XXXX XXXX account was not paid on time
1295,I sent {$150.00} by logging in to my wells fargo app via XXXX I am a first time XXXX user I submitted the payment to the wrong email address due to adding a zero it was sent to someone with a wells fargo account instead of going to a XXXX account I called Wells Fargo immediately and was told to wait 48 hrs i have went inside the branch 3 times requesting help and all they say is for me to contact the person of whom i dont know and all they say is they see my funds in someone wells fargo accounts today i called and a rep says XXXX is like a lottery and i gave free money to a unknown person..I could see if i have used this service before then I should be savvy in transferring funds but I dont have a clue and my financial institutions is not FDIC my funds or going to bat for me and its all internally im at a lost for words I will never use this application again XXXX XXXX offers its user better help than wells fargo please help thank you in advance
1296,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I carried out a wire transfer from a personal brokerage account at XXXX for the amount of {$41000.00}. 

The wire 's anticipated path would be to first credit an intermediary bank XXXX Wells Fargo XXXX before reaching the final destination of another personal brokerage account I hold with XXXX XXXX. 

However, that same day, after waiting longer than usual, I contacted XXXX to confirm that this transfer had been placed. I was given a fed reference number and was told that the transaction had been successfully completed with acceptance of funds by Wells Fargo. 

Next, I contacted XXXX XXXX who had not been notified by Wells Fargo of any wires in the amount of {$41000.00} that were in the account. After a day went by, it became clear that I was headed down the path of Wells Fargo 's deceptive practices, and would experience a a 2 week long run around from party to party to figure out where the funds were. Several recalls for wire were requested, and several calls were made by myself and XXXX to Wells Fargo to understand what would need to be done to rectify the issue. 

Later it was found that the wire instructions I wrote may have caused the disruption, as the final destination account number and the account number at Wells Fargo had apparently been incorrectly swapped on the wire instructions. Normally, wires with unclear instructions would be either totally rejected, and at worse, placed into someone else 's account if this error had been made on the instructions. Neither were the case here. Wells Fargo somehow managed to accept the funds without placing it into the account that XXXX XXXX holds with them ( I correctly included the 10 digit account number provided ). To be clear, Wells Fargo likely hadn't be able to place it into someone else 's account with a XXXX XXXX 9 digit account number that was also provided ( if even in the wrong section ). Instead of rejecting the wire, Wells Fargo continued to hold {$41000.00} without crediting an account that would allow it to be identified, and did not respond to 2 recalls of the wire placed on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. This caused me significant personal anguish as it is my total savings amidst lingering unemployment due to the pandemic. 

Wells Fargo refuses to speak with me about the matter because I am not the account holder. And just today XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, I was able to compel XXXX XXXX ( Wells Fargo account holder ) to investigate the issue further. XXXX XXXX had initially been reluctant to get involved because they had no record that the wire had ever been sent in the first place ( ie not showing in Wells Fargo account ). Regardless, Wells Fargo did respond to communication from XXXX XXXX and confirmed that the funds were sent and that my options were to "" either have the sender place a recall or amend the wire ''. This haphazard response was provided despite XXXX having sent 2 separate wire recalls in the weeks prior. Also note that XXXX XXXX had been able to get detailed information from Wells Fargo about the wire despite Wells Fargo not having officially placed the funds into XXXX XXXX 's account. 

Today makes 2 weeks since the wire had been placed. Wells Fargo appears to be holding the funds hostage with the hope that I will eventually give up on having them returned or to create an unnecessary service delay that would confer a lengthy period of investing the funds for their own gain. I've worked in finance and it is unacceptable and even scammy to accept wires with instructions that make it difficult to place. It appears that they instead accepted it based on the correct information being provided ( ie. swapped account numbers ) and seized the opportunity to hold the funds for a simple error without good intention."

1300,The company in question is Wells Fargo and cash app. I was scammed for the purchase of a dog and I went to my bank and cash app to explain the situation. They both said there was nothing they could do after promising to help me with the situation.
1301,I was attempting to purchase tickets through XXXX. I am only XXXX and just opened account with Wells Fargo. I have never used XXXX and thought that it should be safe since it is on my Wells Fargo app and the bank must trust them. I did log in and transfered {$70.00} which I had in my account at the time. The app told me that it did NOT go through and to try again later. I went through the process again and it actually took both times. Wells Fargo allowed the transaction to post twice at {$70.00} and charged me an Overdraft charge of {$12.00}. I am out {$140.00} and of course I did not receive tickets and the phone number to the person that I thought would be giving me concert tickets is rejecting my calls. The only information I have on the recipient was a phone number and an email address. On my bank statement it shows the name XXXX XXXX. I went to my bank within 30 minutes and no one was able to help me. I have also sent numerous emails to XXXX complaining about this fraud and what happened to me. Neither XXXX nor Wells Fargo is willing to help me. I just started working this summer and am trying to save money for college. I can not afford to lose this much money. I asked Wells Fargo if they could help me with one of the {$70.00} charges but they said they are not able to help me. I hope you can help me with this situation. I would be happy if Wells Fargo would at the least refund me one charge of {$70.00}. I am really upset and have learned my lesson on not trusting anyone and to especially not deal with online sites that you do not know. I really thought that they would be reputable since Wells Fargo trusts them to be on their website and peoples accounts.

I called Wells Fargo again on XX/XX/2021 to check statue on my clam, I was told the clam investigation was still in progress. I called again on XX/XX/2021, got the same answer. I told the Wells Fargo rep to please have someone working on the investigation to contact me, I heard nothing. I received a letter from Wells Faro dated XX/XX/2021 stating they had completed there research, and that too much time had passed before I had contacted Wells Fargo about this fraud. 17 days from the day to the transaction to the claim filed on XX/XX/2021. 
I contacted Well Fargo on XX/XX/2021 at the number I was instructed to call if I had a problem with these findings. I got the usual runaround, transferred numerous times to my call being cut off by an automated system. Wells Fargo did NOTHING to help recover these funds that were transferred through their bank! I believe Wells Fargo believe If they give me the runaround, never answer my calls, numerous inquiries, I will just accept there excuse that I waited to long to report! That is not the case which is absolutely not TRUE! Wells Fargo did nothing to help me or solve this fraud."
1304,"I am afraid I have had to go through so much "" bureaucracy '' thus far in order to catch their attention to my concerns. This really doesn't show their complaints department in a good light, to say the least ; and certainly, does not contribute to my overall satisfaction and peace of mind. 
My complaint is against the bank that did not do its job properly ( could not prevent/foreseen fraud and could not conduct a proper investigation ) and not against the vulnerable customer who fell victim and lost all the savings due to the misconduct of the bank. 
I feel very distressed and cheated, all because no one took action immediately and practice their duty of care, therefore I only request what I believe to be rightfully mine, as all institutions were more than negligent in protecting my account and handling the complaints.

They told me call XXXX and see if they could help me. XXXX was of no help either. There customer support is automated. You can't even speak to anyone in person."
1307,I was purchasing some concert tickets through XXXX  and the seller asked to use XXXX to transfer {$100.00} for 2 tickets in which he would then email me the tickets. I figured that XXXX had the same protections as XXXX services. I transferred the {$100.00} and the individual never emailed the tickets or responded to text messages. I contacted Wells Fargo within 45 minutes of the transaction and they informed me they couldn't stop the transaction so I am now out {$100.00} and not attending the show.

I was told my first task was to deposit a check for {$6200.00} and take the funds and disperse them to orphanage for a medical procedure. I did exactly what he asked cashed the check that was in my name, and send the money get money orders With the cash and send to the given address. I woke up to negative thousands of dollars in my account. I have called Wells Fargo to file. a claim immediately with police reports, emails, texts, the XXXX  application to show I was a victim of fraud/being stolen from. They would not even look at the police report, or talk to the detective, or look at my proof. They denied my claim and refused to give back the money that was stolen from me. The banks job is to put a hold on a check with large amounts of money, and idtenfiy a fraudulent check, They did not do that, They gave the cash right away without making sure the check would clear or was legit. I was truly under the impression I was hired to work as a remote assistant for someone and doing my job thinking this was for the greater good. I have emails, and job descriptions texts to show proof of this. I also filed police reports etc. This has impacted us greatly financially leaving us with our bank account drained."
1310,"On XX/XX/XXXX I used the XXXX app to send {$200.00} to my mother. Id used it before with no issues. My mother registered with XXXX so I added her as a contact. On the app, it said the money was sent to my mother and the transaction was completed. However, the last digit of her phone number was entered incorrectly, so the money was sent to someone else. 

I called Wells Fargo the same day to figure out why she didnt receive the money and they told me it was sent to an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX, which she does not have. When we realized the phone number was incorrect, I called Wells Fargo again to see what could be done. They filed a money movement claim, gave me a case ID number, and assured me they wanted to help me get my money back. 

However, on XX/XX/XXXX I got a letter stating the case was closed and there was nothing they could do. If Wells Fargo puts this service in their app to encourage customers to use it under the guise of it being safer than XXXX, why do they not protect the customers who use it? By offering it through their own app, they market it as something trustworthy and do not educate their customers about the potential risks or the fact that they can not help if something goes wrong. I expect my bank to protect me, especially when using one of its services ( the Wells Fargo App ), and instead am left wondering why they would partner up with a service that does not have customers best interests or safety in mind. 

Furthermore, the person who received my money must have also been a registered user already based on how quickly the money was transferred. ( It was not left pending, as it would have been if the user was not yet registered. ). Why didnt XXXX protect me and my money by checking that what I entered matched XXXX own records? They allow the contact to be saved with whatever name is entered by the sender. I feel like I was not informed that this was possible and assumed the information was correct because it saved with the right name. There is no step in place to protect the sender - even the confirmation step only shows the saved contacts name, not phone number, for final verification."
1311,"On XX/XX/2020, I received a call from Washington D.C. A  woman introduced herself from Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( government agency ) and notified me that I, as an XXXX XXXX, violated immigration law ( she said I failed to register my XXXX  number within 90 days of entry, which is not required at all ) and I would be deported immediately under the alleged criminal charge. She directed me to go to the ICE website and read some clauses that charge criminal charges against me. Also, there was another call from a man, allegedly from New York Sheriff Office, while I was talking to her, to tell me that my case was reported to his office. Both put me on hold on purpose and didn't let me talk to anyone because this conversation was allegedly confidential. I believe those were a team to corner and scare me into believing that this was real. 

After I felt threatened enough to believe that the call was legitimate, she gave me two choices to get away with criminal charges and stay in the U.S. : 1 ) I hand myself over to the police office and pay a huge amount of money ( I don't recall the amount ) or 2 ) I pay so called "" deposit bond '' until the case investigation is over and I have no charges. Or, she said I would be removed immediately. I chose the second one because that sounded more reasonable to me and I was so scared. I just wanted to get this done with investigation. 

She asked me to transfer money through XXXX on Wells Fargo. Throughout the whole process, she monitored my activity via remote access program on my laptop and cell phone to prevent me from doing anything out of ordinary. But because the first transaction via XXXX allowed up to {$500.00}, I sent {$500.00} to an alleged email address of Attorney General and then received a text that {$500.00} failed to come through, which turned out to be fake. She said XXXX didn't work and asked me to use wire transfer alternatively. This time, I was told to transfer {$5000.00} of deposit bond to outside the U.S. She also added that since my credit card and bank account would be frozen during the investigation, a Treasury officer would be visiting  my place to give me a temporary check. I transferred {$5000.00} and she kept me waiting on and on until the transaction is complete. At that point, I realized something was weird and talked to my roommate about the call. 

I borrowed my roommate 's phone to report the phone scam to Wells Fargo right away. I reported XXXX transaction XXXX XXXX and wire transfer ), but a banker said the XXXX transaction is not their responsibility and it usually takes 5 business days for investigation. 5 business days later, I contacted the bank again. This time, another banker said I can also file a claim regarding the XXXX transaction and investigation takes up to 10 business days. I patiently waited until I received two letters from the bank that denied the refund of total {$5500.00}, as opposed to what they told me, in most of cases, money is refunded. 

The first letter indicated that a wire transfer of {$5000.00} is not refundable because the receiving bank will not return the money. The case was closed. The second letter mentioned that because the transaction was made by me through a secure online banking session, the bank declines my claim. The case was closed. 

In short, the bank didn't return any amount of {$5500.00}, not to mention that it didn't get any clue of scammers."
1316,"I used the XXXX money transfer app because it was advertised in my Wells Fargo app so I trusted to use it to transfer money over in exchange for tickets that I was trying to purchase on XX/XX/2018. However, I did not know there was no protection from scammers or any kind of fraudulent activity. When the person never meet with me to transfer the tickets I realized I had been scammed and reached out to XXXX and Wells Fargo, my bank. You can imagine my surprise when I found out there was nothing they would do. I filed a claim with Wells Fargo and once it was denied, even after the associate I talked to initially made it seem like there would be no problem getting refunded, I contacted them again. They said there was nothing they would do because they don't cover that and to contact XXXX. I told them I already had and that they wouldn't do anything to protect the user. Since Wells Fargo owns XXXX, I thought it was interesting that there was "" nothing that they can do ''. As a member of the bank for years I believe I should be protected against scams and fraudulent activity that I was victim to in this situation."
1317,On XX/XX/19 some opened up a bank account in my company name and intercepted a wire that was meant for my company in the amount of {$5200.00}
1318,"On XX/XX/2021 I received a text from what I thought was an automated fraud alert ( XXXX ) XXXX in regards to someone attempting to hack my bank account. While reading the message. I received a phone call from Wells Fargo fraud dept XXXX. The guy on the phone was "" alerting me '' that someone was trying to use my card at a XXXX in Texas. He then proceeded to say that I would need to reverse the funds as he began walking me through the process. He informed me that there were unusual transactions based in Texas. I did not approve neither one of them. He then asked about the XXXX  transaction and informed me that the scammers were trying to drain my account using XXXX. He said that in order to reverse the transaction. I needed to send the money to myself, so that it would not be approved. It was an odd request/protocol, but he reminded me that he was calling from Wells Fargo and he gave me his badge number ( XXXX ) told me that the number should match the back of my debit card. And to my surprise, it did and so I believed him. 

I then added myself as a XXXX recipient with MY NUMBER and MY NAME and transferred {$1000.00} from my Checking account to MY SELF! Immediately after doing so, I heard a cell phone notification in the background. That's when I hung the phone up. I immediately called Wells Fargo fraud number ( XXXX ) AGAIN. The lady that answered was soo rude and made matters worse for me. I attempted to call them again, hoping to get someone else on the phone. 

Everything happened so quick. I'm not sure if its an inside job or not. But the scammer was REALLY GOOD AND BELIEVABLE! 

- I have copies of the phone number that called me -I have the phone number that text me ( fraud alert ) -I have the copy of the XXXX transaction to MYSELF -I have an email of the account/banking institution that the funds went to and the name on the account"
1319,"These two charges appeared on my account as pending one was for {$150.00} and the other was for {$500.00}. I contacted the Fraud Department immediately upon noticing these two transactions pending on my account which were as follows : XX/XX/XXXX PURCHASE AUTHORIZED ON XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX* XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX XXXX  XXXX {$150.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  TO XXXX XXXX ON XX/XX/XXXX REF # XXXX {$500.00} I was told by the Fraud Department I needed to change my account number and go into a branch. They would investigate and the money would be returned to my account as these transactions were not authorized or done by me. On XX/XX/XXXX, a final credit of {$150.00} was given to me but nothing on the {$500.00}. I called to see where my {$500.00} credit was prior to opening todays mail with a letter stating I made the transaction or someone who had my authorization did it and I was not going to receive my money. 
Please be advised I have had my account for approximately 29 years through XXXX then Wells Fargo. I recently put the Wells Fargo app on my cellphone only to get access codes for my XXXXyear-old son, XXXX, to withdraw money. At no point in time have I ever signed up for a XXXX account or know a XXXX XXXX. I am extremely upset as this is not chump change this is {$500.00} someone hacked into my account and fraudulently took money from me. I notified the FBI with regards to these transactions as well. I have since deleted the Wells Fargo app from my phone and am still awaiting my appointment with the XXXX store to review my cellphone. 
I would appreciate all your assistance in this matter and am willing to have prosecuted whoever hacked my account. All I want is {$500.00} to be credited back to my account."
1321,"On XX/XX/22 I received a text from a spoofed number who claimed to be my bank, Wells Fargo. Stating there was attempted payment through XXXX of {$3000.00}. I did not respond since I was unsure if it was real. A while later I get a call from Wells Fargo as I have them in my contacts. I pick up and a man by the name of XXXX XXXX confirms that there was {$3000.00} taken from my account through XXXX. He then directs me on how to get it back by going on my Wells Fargo app and XXXX myself the money back. I input my full name and phone number and first sent {$500.00}, {$2000.00}, {$1000.00}, and finally {$500.00} for a total of {$4000.00}. When the app notified me that I have hit my transfer limit he said he will call back in a month to make sure I received my money. I did not authorize my money to be sent to someone else, I was scammed into thinking it was going to myself. I open a claim with Wells Fargo and have called multiple times to no success. They state that although this has happened multiple times to other people with their bank that they can not help. This has happened for years, two women even took to the media and after that Wells Fargo decided to give them their money back."
1322,"On XX/XX/2021, I purchased an item on XXXX XXXX. I sent my payment through XXXX in the amount of {$300.00}. The recipient is XXXX. 

The next day, I realized that it was a scam since the shipping number was not working and the seller is no longer responsive - I never received the item until now. I reported this incident to the Federal Trade Commission, and to my bank, Wells Fargo and asked if they could stop or reverse the transfer. I also asked if they could contact XXXX 's bank to report his fraudulent activity ( ies ). 

I received a letter from my bank today and they are saying that since I authorized the transaction I am not eligible for a claim."
1324,On XX/XX/2020 I did express send with an amount of {$650.00} to a family member to the bank XXXX in XXXX. But on their end is showing that their was no money sent to the account.

The wire ended up going to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Texas XXXX. What I learned on XXXX XXXX was that XXXX XXXX XXXX never received the wire. It appears the email correspondence had been compromised by someone else. XXXX XXXX XXXX called the FBI and started an internal investigation. XXXX also called Wells Fargo because XXXX DOES NOT have ANY accounts with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo confirmed the account that received the money was not in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX nor any of its officers. Wells Fargo refused to return my money despite this being an apparent violation of anti money laundering laws passed after XXXX. My wire should have been rejected by Wells Fargo as the name of the wire did not match with any name on the receiving account. I called XXXX who closed one investigation but currently has a global investigation open through my local branch manager. I contact XXXX and XXXX in XXXX XXXX who wrote a demand of payment to the Wells Fargo branch in XXXX with no response. I also filed a complaint with the OCC, and the Texas Banking Commission, and IC3. I have a police report and an open investigation with the XXXX County Sheriff 's office.

After purchase, I travelled overseas on assignment, as I travelled extensively as a XXXX XXXX. 
Once I established this fact, I tried cashing said Cashier Checks and was told they were too old and must call the State Treasurer or call Customer Service. 
Customer Service, XXXX, in Idaho, assured me there was no problem because said checks were OFFICIAL CHECKS and had NO EXPIRATION date and directed me to go to WELLS FARGOs main Branch on XXXX XXXX XXXX. Washington, DC, and attempted to secure an appointment for me with the Branch Manager to make it easier and faster, but XXXX XXXX was unable to set that up due to some Electronics problem. 
I went ahead to that Branch, only to be denied cashing said Checks due to their age as too old. 
I called WELLS FARGO Customer Service again, and again they were dumbfounded as to why their Branch/Branches were not honoring such checks. 
Then I was given a phone Number to call in order to be reissued a REPLACEMENT CASHIER CHECKS, but the Phone Number provided by WELLS FARGO reached XXXX XXXX? 

Thus, I file this complaint in the hope of recovering my money."
1328,Sent a XXXX payment to my roommate but roommate didnt inform me they closed the account and wasnt able to cancel it right after i sent the money. Now wells fargo will not return my {$800.00} that is missing from my account. As i sent money via XXXX instead to my roommates new bank account. They denied the claim saying the payment was completed regardless of the issue.
1332,"While trying to buy a house, my wife and I fell victim to an email scam / wire fraud. My attorney 's email account was hacked, and I was sent phony wire instructions. I followed those instructions and sent over {$260000.00} from my account at XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to a fraudster account at Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo contacted me the next day saying that there were some red flags indicating fraud, such as the name on the account ( a personal account ) and the name of the intended wire recipient ( XXXX XXXX of NJ ), did not match. I called the XXXX XXXX   and confirmed they did not receive payment, then went to XXXX  XXXX XXXX to recall the transaction. We filed a report with the police and they were able to tell us approximately {$2000.00} was stolen, the rest was frozen in the account at Wells Fargo. After and a lot of phone calls, Wells Fargo completed their investigation. In order to transfer the remaining funds, Wells Fargo required a Letter of Indemnity, which would basically cover them if they were mistaken to remove funds from the fraudster account. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX refused to provide the Letter of Indemnity. They refused to provide it because they feel that they are  not at fault and will not accept the risk. We are unable to recover our money from Wells Fargo"
1333,"Date : XX/XX/2021 My wife was contacted by text from a registered Wells Fargo number that asked if she authorized a transaction of {$3500.00} to a person we don't know through the XXXX real-time-payment app Wells Fargo offers. The text provided a number to call if she didn't authorize the transaction. 

She phoned the number and the person on the other end started walking her through a process of "" undoing '' the transaction by sending the money back to herself in increments starting with {$1000.00}. It sounded sketchy so she hung up, checked our account, and I immediately phoned Wells Fargo to alert them to stop any transaction. While I was on hold waiting for an agent, my wife contacted a customer representative through the chat function on our online account. 

After explaining the situation, the chat representative indicated that Wells Fargo did not contact my wife, checked the account, told her everything was fine and that we had nothing to worry about. All of this took about XXXX minutes while I waited on hold. Once we had been assured everything was okay. I hung up and felt relieved we had averted disaster. 

I looked to see if I could learn about a scam like this online and saw the exact same scam was happening to XXXX XXXX XXXX customers in XXXX. Then I logged back into our account to make sure everything was okay and found that the scam transaction was in process as if my wife sent money to herself through XXXX and we were out {$1000.00}. 

I immediately phoned Wells Fargo, waited for an agent, who recognized the scam, told me the online chat customer service agents have no way to recognize or stop the transaction and that if I would have contacted them by phone, it could have been stopped ( assuming I could get through before the transaction went through ). The agent had me file an online claim and indicated that the situation would be resolved in XXXX and was mostly a matter of investigating and ensuring we weren't scamming Wells Fargo before they restored our funds. 

At the beginning of XXXX, we received a letter from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/XXXX indicating the claim was closed and that Wells Fargo doesn't guarantee the XXXX services it offers, XXXX offers no guarantees or insurance, and they were unable to stop or reverse the funds. 

I immediately contacted Wells Fargo on the phone and the agent apologized for "" confusing wording '' in the letter and assured me they were still working on the claim. The agent indicated that since we were hit after the scam was well known for several months, XXXX had identified the recipients and Wells Fargo was having luck restoring funds through the third-party XXXX app XXXX I was advised to give it a few weeks and follow up and told if I used the phone number on the letter when we initially got scammed, I would have been able to get right through and top the transaction. 

After hearing nothing outside of a customer feedback survey for a month, my wife phoned Wells Fargo to follow up on the claim. She was told that : 1. She authorized the transaction. 

2. It wasn't their problem that scammers used the Wells Fargo customer service phone number to initiate the scam. 

XXXX. Their real-time payments partner, XXXX, doesn't guarantee or protect any transactions and it was more of a XXXX problem than a Wells Fargo problem XXXX even though Wells Fargo promotes XXXX services in customer online accounts ). 

4. The money was already transferred before she hung up the phone with the scammers. 

5. The customer service online chat agent that indicated they checked our account, everything was okay, our concern was noted, and we had nothing to worry about was an unreliable bot that couldn't check or know anything. 

And we are out of luck. They refused to refund our account or indicate any responsibility for the situation. They blamed us for falling for it and XXXX for carrying it out."
1334,"I bank with Wells Fargo. I used their XXXX bank transfer to submit a security deposit of {$260.00} for an apartment. Unfortunately, I was scammed. XXXX, is not afford fraud protection by Wells Fargo. I feel this is a misrepresentation of their services. I bank with the intention of having my money protected in case of an emergency. I would like my {$260.00} refunded because it only took about an hour to notice the fraud."
1337,"On XX/XX/XXXX, i initiated a outgoing wire of {$800.00} from my XXXX XXXX account to fund my brokerage XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Prior to this, i had already successfully completed a wire which was accepted within 2days. So it is completely absurd that a following wire would be halted if the first one went through with no issues. Currently, my wire is being held since its original send date with an expectancy of XX/XX/XXXX ( well over ). The supposed issue is that Wells fargo, the intermediary bank, is requesting additional details, all of which i have provided in the utmost timely matter, only to be strung in circles and given basic company runaround. The issue i believe is the name on my XXXX XXXX account WAS NOT FULLY UPDATED BY XXXX. Meaning, I stepped into a branch give info on current name ( mid XXXX ) and the branch updated one of my accounts for online banking and my statements, however for some reason?!? not my 2nd account which i had sent the wire on. My name is updated for online  banking ( XXXX website ), however my statements reflect my old name which is completely on XXXX. I did not realize this until i had been given This extreme wait for a small wire, completely unacceptable. XXXX has provided wells fargo all of the details which they have asked, however Wells fargo has taken their sweet time in reviewing this ( for possible compliance issues ) and i feel as though I am being treated like a criminal and having to wait 2+ weeks on a small wire for an issue that is completely upon XXXX/Wells Fargo."
1340,"I am filing this complaint because I am the victim of a XXXX scam. I have requested Wells Fargo Bank to reimburse me for my loss, but my request has been repeatedly denied. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX, I received a Free Msg text on my cell phone alerting me that someone was attempting to make XXXX transfers from my checking account at Wells Fargo Bank in the amounts of {$700.00} and {$1000.00}. I didnt open the text but immediately checked my account on the Wells Fargo mobile phone app on my phone and saw an unauthorized {$.00} withdrawal from my account, which I believed meant that her checking account was compromised. I immediately called the Wells Fargo fraud department, but while I was on hold, I received an incoming call from a number identified as Wells Fargo, so I answered. 

The caller identified himself as XXXX, a Wells Fargo Fraud Specialist. He said that {$700.00} and {$1000.00} had been taken from my account and that I needed to immediately initiate a XXXX transfer back to myself to get the money back. I was confused and frantic, and I initiated the transfers as instructed, first in the amount of {$700.00}, another for {$1000.00} and a third in the amount of {$1800.00}, ( XXXX told me that another {$1800.00} had been transferred from her my account while we were talking ). For each transfer, I received a verification code, which I then gave to XXXX. A few minutes later, I received three alerts on my mobile phone from XXXX XXXX  ( with whom I do not maintain any accounts ) confirming that the payments were received from me and sent to account ending in XXXX at XXXX XXXX. 

I reported the fraud to Wells Fargo immediately, but I didnt even get a response until XX/XX/XXXX, and was told that my claim was denied because I had initiated the transfers, Wells Fargo was unable to stop or reverse the funds. I requested copies of the documents from Wells Fargo which I finally got in XX/XX/XXXX. According to XXXX at Wells Fargo, I would most likely get the money back because anyone who asks for the documents usually does.

A phone call followed from seemingly the Wells Fargo fraud department ( number saved in my phone ).

They had me create a new XXXX account with my name and phone number, no other information disclosed. My login information was not disclosed during the call.

I have submitted a report of the situation to the FBI 's XXXX branch for Internet-related crimes. I will attach those documents with some sensitive material removed for privacy 's sake. 

After taking proper steps to alert the authorities, I went to Wells Fargo to hopefully get the transaction reversed, however, I received a very vague statement which seems the claim to refund or reverse the {$500.00} ( one {$200.00} and one {$300.00} ) transfer was denied. I received two forms in the mail stating that Wells Fargo was looking into the matter, dated XX/XX/21, and two follow-up forms dated XX/XX/21. Those are attached for reference as well."
1354,I received a text message from number claiming to be Wellsfargo that someone was trying to make a payment. It said reply yes or no. I replied No. I then received a call from a Wellsfargo number. He said that he would put a stop to it immediately and that they were trying to zelle money to the reserves from my account but he put a pause on it. He sounded very professional and said I would need to sign in and transfer the money back to myself since it was on pause. I put in my phone number and name. He wanted me to do it XXXX times. I started to fill uneasy but I was getting texts and he assured me it was wellsfsrgo and the number did match. As I seen my bank account go low he Said that after the process he will clear it and it will go in my bank account. He said he had zelle on the line trying to get back my funds. He said if we don't complete I'll be on out XXXX. I hung up because I did not feel right. I called my bank and they informed it was not them. I filed a claim. I read that with banks should fix it with title E protection? I have not much money and this scam really ruined me and put me in a financial burden. I am devastated that I actually got skammed and violated that the could so easily hack my account.
1355,"On XX/XX/21, I received a phone call from caller ID : Wells Fargo Customer Service. A man claiming to be an employee of Wells Fargo informed me that there appeared to be fraudulent activity on my account. He asked if I had made a purchase in Georgia for {$1000.00} - I told him no. He asked if I made a purchase in Oregon for {$3000.00} - I told him no. 
He confirmed that there was fraudulent activity going on and asked me to open up my Wells Fargo app and look at the last several transactions. He asked if I saw a couple amounts of less than {$1.00} and if I had authorized these. I indeed saw the ~ {$0.00} and ~ {$0.00} payments from unknown sources and let him know I didn't authorize these. I also saw a {$24.00} transaction that I wasn't sure if I recognized. I later found out that this was made to XXXX, although I didn't know it at the time. He then confirmed that my account was under attack but there was a way to get the money back. 

He proceeded to tell me to open the XXXX app right there at the bottom of my Wells Fargo app. I had never heard or even seen this button before. He began to explain that they way "" these perpetrators '' get my money is through this app. He guides me in how to set up an account for myself. At some point during this process, he let me know that a XXXX XXXX account had been the account that tried to take my money, so he needed to cancel that. He let me know that a text message would come in with a confirmation code that I needed to read to him - I did so without reading the entire text. I later found out that this text was a XXXX XXXX account set up message, and the confirmation code was to set up my account. 

He proceeded to walk me through how to add myself as a recipient through the XXXX XXXX. I simply added MY name and MY telephone number. He made sure to advise me to enter my phone number and NOT my email address. 

Once the account was set up, I was instructed to send MYSELF {$1000.00} "" to reverse the previous transactions. '' I did so, and I let him know that the transaction was complete. 

Through this process, I believe I gave him 1-2 more confirmation codes from my phone that came through as text messages, that I will provide. 

This started to concern me when I was that the {$1000.00} I had just "" sent to myself '' was now missing out of my checking account balance ... XXXX began to worry that I was being scammed. As he was talking, I looked up the phone number this man was calling from. XXXX confirmed that it was the Wells Fargo customer service number, so I began to relax again. 

He then tried to get me to reverse the other alleged {$3000.00} but my account limit had been reached ( thankfully ). I tried asking this man to explain this process to me because it wasn't making sense. He let me know that "" everything is looking good and is under control '' but that I would need to call back in 24 hours to have the rest of the money transferred back. 

I asked if I could get a confirmation code, and he told me there was no need to worry because everything was looking good and was under control. 

I asked if I could go to the bank to finish the rest of this because it was starting to not make sense to me. That's when the man told me to absolutely not go to the bank. When I questioned him, he quickly made an excuse and hung up. 

I immediately rushed to my nearest Wells Fargo and explained what happened. I asked if the XXXX transaction could be reversed and was told no, since it was an authorized transaction. I filed and claim, and the bank employee agreed that he had never heard of a scam like this. He also confirmed that the number was their customer service number. I asked him where the XXXX money had been transferred to, and it looked like XXXX XXXX ( myself ) had been the recipient. I then asked him how I access that money, and he wasn't sure. 

The bank employee also warned me that he was now concerned that this scammer either had or was trying to access my credit. He explained that the {$24.00} charge was to XXXX, which I was previously unaware of. 

Immediately after leaving Wells Fargo on XX/XX/21, I went to the nearest XXXX XXXX  branch. The employee could not find a XXXX account under my name or information. She could also not provide any information on a XXXX XXXX account for me. 

I did call XXXX later. They identified 3 separate names of individuals I did not know, all of whom were linked with my old debit card number. All accounts were not currently added, so XXXX was able to drop the {$24.00} charge. They could not give me any further information on who contacted them with my bank number. 

The claim to have the charge reverse through Wells Fargo were denied. I was denied getting refunded for this transaction. I was able to reverse the two ~ {$0.00} and ~ {$0.00} charges through my Wells Fargo claims. 

I have my credit currently frozen. I am still hoping to get reimbursed for the {$1000.00} lost. It has been a tough holiday season with that kind of loss."
1356,"On XX/XX/2022, my husband and I purchased a car from a company online. We sent a wire transfer from our bank, XXXX to an escrow account at Wells Fargo. The company would not receive the money till we received the car. On XX/XX/2022, I received a phone call from XXXX from Wells Fargo that there was a problem with the wire. I called the fraud department back and was told that our money was safe in the escrow account at Wells Fargo and were told to go back to our bank, XXXX and have them do a recall on the wire so we could get our money returned. Unfortunately, XXXX XXXX  performed 4 recalls and each time Wells Fargo ignored the recall. On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to our local police department to see if they could get anywhere. Unfortunately, they were told that the money was gone and we weren't getting it back. It is now XXXX and I can't find anyone to help me in this matter. 
Thank you, XXXX XXXX"
1357,"Wells Fargo allowed an illegal/unauthorized transaction to occur ; the bank allowed my ex-spouse to deposit/cash a two-payee check from the US Treasury, which was a refund for overpayment which I made from income that I generated. As a consequence, I never received so much as XXXX cent from the check. This check was illegally cashed in XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo never notified me, reconciled, or caught this transaction and they have not responded to my communication at all. 

I went to a NJ Wells Fargo branch on XX/XX/XXXX, reported the transaction, gave them a copy of the unsigned check ( which I obtained from the IRS ), and filed a complaint. I was told that I would hear from the back within 3 to 10 days. I never heard from the back. I then called the branch back on XX/XX/XXXX, and told the branch manager that I never heard from Wells Fargo ; he apologized and stated that he called the division which investigates such matters, but that the division stated that they had "" a lot of work '' and should be reaching out to me within 2 days."
1358,"Hello, On XX/XX/2021 I went to my local Wells Fargo branch for a cashier 's check and found it closed. In light of this, I went online to Wells Fargo and requested a cashier 's check for the amount of {$500.00}, payable to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. I also agreed to an {$8.00} delivery fee. According to the Wells Fargo website, the check would be delivered to my home address the next day and signature would be requested. 

On XX/XX/2021 I received an email from Wells Fargo informing me that my check had been processed and that it would be delivered on XX/XX/2021. The email contained request number XXXX. 

The check was not delivered. On XX/XX/2021 I called Wells Fargo and was told that my check had been in fact actually delivered by XXXX on Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX and signature had been collected from an XXXX XXXX. There is no one by that name in my household. Plus I have XXXX camera and there is no movement registered of a XXXX courier at my address on Wednesday XXXX XXXXThe Wells Fargo representative shared XXXX tracking details : XXXX. As I am not the owner of that account ( Wells Fargo is ) I am unable to see the signature. 

The same Wells Fargo representative shared that if I wanted to stop payment and report the check as lost or stolen, I would have to go to a branch. I also opened a case with Wells Fargo and was given case number XXXX. 

That day, XX/XX/2021 I went to my local branch and found it closed again. I went to another branch where I was told that I needed an appointment to process the report and that I could not be assisted that day. Since I still needed the cashier 's check, I requested another check at the branch for XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and received it. 

On Monday XX/XX/2021 I went to my local Wells Fargo branch to complete the stop payment and lost/stolen process for my original XX/XX/2021 check. I was given an appointment for XX/XX/2021. On XX/XX/2021 I spent 2 hours at the branch, were I was assisted by 4 individuals. I was told that payment could not be stopped and the check could not be reported as lost or stolen because "" no one knew '' the check 's number. I was advised to call Wells Fargo Online again to request "" provisional '' credit for my {$500.00} and to talk to my Case Manager. 

I talked to my Case Manager a couple of times, as well as to Wells Fargo Online representatives. I have been told that my case would be looked into. I have talked to upwards of 10 individuals at Wells Fargo and everyone shares the same information : "" this is highly unusual '', "" you should call Online '', "" you should go to a branch ''. The personnel at Wells Fargo told me they would open another Case about my case. And the last person I spoke to, shared that "" my Case had been closed without a resolution and that she would open another case complaining about this fact ''.

In the meantime, I do not have any credit for my {$500.00} or any guidance on when and how this check, which was delivered by XXXX  and signed by another individual, will be cancelled. According to what I have been told by Wells Fargo, there should be 3 cases about my current situation. I am attaching the original email from Wells Fargo, which I had forwarded to one of the branch 's personal bankers. Please help! I do not know what else to do."
1362,"The issue is with Wells Fargo and the use of the bank connected XXXX mobile transfer within their app. 

On XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX I made 2 transfers of money totaling {$500.00} and {$150.00} respectively. The only warnings of XXXX that WF provided is to make sure it is someone you know. I transfered the money to someone who is a mutual member of a XXXX group I follow, for a purchase we discussed in great detail including 16 emails. Once the 2 payments were sent the buyer deleted their XXXX account and no longer responded to emails.

I reached out to WF immediately for claims and they have refused to compensate in any ways claiming they are "" with no error on our part ''. My issue was with the lack of warnings and protections that were not clearly communicated before transactions can be made. On WF  description of what is XXXX, words such as "" secure '' appear and state that the service is operated and managed by WF when used through the WF app. 

On XX/XX/XXXX WF released an update across the platform creating more awareness and warnings for the lack of protection regarding the XXXX transfer service. The fact that WF knew there were issues with scams, that they didn't offer protection, and that the service did not properly display these concerns displays negligence on WF to protect its customers. WF should have preformed a hot fix or a temporary XXXX closure to secure or properly display warnings of transactions not being protected. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received mail dated XX/XX/XXXX, declaring that WF would not offer to recoup any of the lost funds. ( see attached ) I have been a customer for over 5 years, and if WF can not properly assist they will lose my business. 

Claim numbers : {$500.00} : XXXX {$150.00} : XXXX"
1363,"On  XXXX   XXXX ,  2017  I was hired by  XXXX   XXXX  and given an employment offer letter. I was hired by a  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  who then instructed me that I would be training for a week and that I need to purchase software and a time tracker in order to go forward with the training. He also informed me that I would need a laptop and that if I did not have  one  that  XXXX  would provide one for me. Towards the end of the hiring interview,  XXXX   XXXX  told me that a check would be issued to me for the purchase of the software I would need. I received the check  (  {$2900.00 } )  and was instructed to deposit it and once it had cleared I was to send the money to the vendor to purchase the software and time tracker. The first check was not sufficient to pay for the laptop also, so another check  (  {$4800.00} ) was issued and sent for that purchase 2 days later. I was instructed to deposit that amount into the vendor 's account via   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  and informed that my laptop, various softwares and timer would arrive by the following monday. On Monday I received a third check for {$12000.00}. At this point I became suspicious because I had not received any working/training materials and was being asked to deposit another check to purchase a different set of equipment. It was at this point, I went to the bank manager and after some investigation she determined the check was fraudulent. My bank then contacted the bank of the issued check and they confirmed the check was not a real check. At this point, the monies for the first   XXXX  chec ks was withdrawn from my account by my bank because they were deemed to ba fake as well.   Now, I have lost {$ 7700.00} ( {$2900.00} + {$4800.00} ) due to this fraud/scam and Wells Fargo (  my bank ) will not reimburse or credit my account and my account is now negative with a negative {$3100.00} balance. I have everything documented. I have printed out the entire conversation between myself and  XXXX   XXXX  as well as all company documents i received.   I would like to be reimbursed either by  Wells Fargo  or  XXXX  as both of these companies should have been more diligent and responsible in handling these checks and making sure that I was not scammed out of my money . Wells Fargo no t only did not inform me that the firs t  XXXX  che cks were fake, but they actually cleared the checks and credited my account with those funds and then took them out of my account after I blew the whistle on the third check. Now i have a $  XXXX  balance.  XXXX  should be more diligent than allowing scammers to have access to their letterheads, documents etc that were used to scam me."
1365,"On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I had a inbound XXXX wire transfer of XXXX converted to USD {$71000.00}. 
Being that the XXXX was slightly better that the USD with the days XXXX range of XXXX to XXXX with the close at XXXX. I felt they were taking a awfully large % and wanted to know how it broke down. 

I went to the local branch, and of course they had to call someone at the XXXX desk. After going over the information with XXXX in XXXX, I told him this was a very poor exchange rate exchange rate and that they needed to re-evaluate it, his response was that they are very competitive in the exchange market. I then pointed out to him that a bank here in Florida, XXXX would do it all day long in any currency at .075 % under XXXX, and their a small fraction of the size of Wells Fargo. 

He said he never heard of them and said that was the best they could do as it is a program. He did tell me the executed rate they gave me was XXXX. This is like a exchange rate at a window at the airport in my opinion."
1366,"On XX/XX/XXXX I fell victim to a multilayered scam operation orchestrated by XXXX ( https : XXXX ) that offered me fraudulent investment services for a total amount of {$260000.00} USD, {$110000.00} USD and XXXX XXXX ( the total XXXX  value when the facts took place was of {$150000.00} USD ) through different transactions done from my accounts in XXXX XXXX to accounts of Wells Fargo, XXXX XXXX ( 2 payments of {$46.00} USD in total to the account of a client registered as XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX  USA ( 1 payment of {$25000.00} USD to the account of a client registered as XXXX XXXX XXXX ) XXXX 

In the case of Wells Fargo, according to the instructions received by my interlocutor, I made two money transactions to the account of a client of Wells Fargo registered as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for a total amount of {$39000.00} USD, ( {$25000.00} + {$14000.00} ). 

In XX/XX/XXXX I denounced these facts to Wells Fargo Bank informing how a customer of that bank was making use of this account for fraudulent activities as a part of a criminal organization, asking them to take measures against these facts and to refund the total amount illegally obtained by their customer. 

I asked Wells Fargo to assume also its own responsibility, since they should have already detected the fraudulent use of this account through robust internal systems that should have implemented the bank to detect and report this kind of suspicious activities according to what laws and financial regulation in developed countries stablishes in order to prevent frauds, criminal activities and money laundering. 

All the payment instructions were always received from the same interlocutor, what demonstrates how all the persons involved in this fraud took part of the same criminal organization. 

Additionally, I send you a screenshot that vinculates all the payments in the same crime squeme, recognizing the same individual having received payments from me for a total amount of {$240000.00} USD. 

Difference between my calculation and his can is due to that I include in the fraud all the fees and costs of the transactions, expensive for international money transfers and even more in case of XXXX payments, and the other part only considers the amount received. 

Wells Fargo indicates in their Response Letter that they cant refund the money from a customers account unless being required from a Courts Order or from the Authorities. 

They also dont accept to have any responsibility for not detecting any criminal activity related to this account. 

Although other banks and exchanges are involved in the process, I have only got a definitive negative from Wells Fargo. All the rest of entities affected are still under the claim process, without having got any definitive response yet. 

About documents included : Please take into account tat the document called XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX is an Excel Sheet composed by different sheets. Each sheet indicates each one of the payments done by different ways, Bank Transfer, XXXX payments through different Exchanges. First sheet is a complete summary of all the payments done. 

If anymore information is required, please dont hesitate to contact me."
1367,"I was scammed by buying tickets from someone who knows how to work the XXXX system easily and my bank had 0 concern to correct this. This happened on XX/XX/18 at XXXX and I called the bank at XXXX to cancel the transaction- and they said there was nothing they could do. But to start from the beginning I transferred to a guy through XXXX. I use Wells Fargo, he uses XXXX XXXX XXXX. He gave me his name, email address and phone number ( which I have ). He said this was the service he was most comfortable with and we all could trust it since it was through the bank. Since I havent used it before and he gave me all the details and sounded like a decent gentleman, I wasnt that concerned with it. The transfer went through while I was on the phone with him. He said he was sending an email and then the call dropped and when I tried to call back I go no answer- so no tickets or anything. I was sure I could cancel thetransfet since it just went through but That wasnt the case. I called Wells Fargo and spoke to a number of ppl which led me to a lady named XXXX a supervisor over the fraud dept. went through all the infor for over an hour again and she said she had to look into it a little more and she would give me a call back that night. She never did, so the next day I called and went through the same process and this time they gave me XXXX XXXX, who was repeating the same thing over and over about why I shouldnt have done it- which I already knew. They had 0 concern for this guy that was scamming others nor do they keep track of when ppl call in regarding scammers. I found out this guy banks with XXXX  XXXX XXXX I filed a police report. And sounds like no one has any respect or concern for the issue. The way I was treated at Wells Fargo was shocking- I know this wasnt my smartest move but Ive banked with them for years and they dont hold any credibility over not warning us the charge will not be pending, and that have a system they are in network with that is perfect set up for scammers to defraud their clients and they have no regard for it they said I probably will not see that money again. Costumer service wasnt very good, it almost makes me want to change banks."

I have never bought bitcoin. So I called the number at XXXX to dispute the transaction. The other person on the line was incredibly professional and convincing. He claimed the charge came from an IP address in Texas. I have no association with Texas. They wanted to verify my IP address by sending money through XXXX. This was to verify my IP address. They assured me the money was going to come to me instantly again from their manager, XXXX XXXX. The XXXX tag was registered as XXXX. I ended up sending 2 transactions to them. One for {$1300.00}, and another for {$1300.00}. The money was taken right away. They hung up and that was it. I rushed to my nearest Wells Fargo bank and explained everything. I filed a complaint and got all new accounts. 

I had filed a complaint here but nothing came out of it. Until today I read about Regulation E. It seems I may have a chance through this Federal law. XXXX scams are becoming rampant as of late. XXXX XXXX has been looking into this issue and asking questions. I ask that you please consider my case again and find another reason as to how I can get a refund.

The add had a telephone number listed as the primary contact. I contacted the telephone number via text message. The person on the other end responded back to me. I asked the person if he had two ( 2 ) tickets available for three different games I wanted to go to and the person responded back saying "" Yes ''. The person said the total would be {$650.00} USC. I asked the person how I should pay and he said via XXXX/XXXX XXXX. The person advised once he received the money he would transfer the tickets to my XXXX ticket account.

The person advised he would still send me the tickets. A few minutes went by and I never received the tickets. I contacted the person multiple times within 15 minutes and did not receive any responses. About 15 minutes later, I contacted my bank, Wells Fargo, to report a fraud/scam.

The representative told me this happens all the time and that I should be "" okay ''. After 24 hours later, I did not receive the tickets. I contacted Wells Fargo again and spoke to a representative. I told the representative I called the night before to report a fraud/scam and I was advised to call 24 hours later if I did not receive the tickets. I told the representative what happened and provided all the information. I told the representative the contact number that was listed on XXXX was fake and was a VOIP ( Voice of Internet Protocol ).

I told the representative I have never filed a fraud/scam claim before and that I'm a Premier Account holder with Wells Fargo. I've been with Wells Fargo for 15 years and is in good standing. The representative told me I will hear something within 10 business days. On XX/XX/2018, I received a letter from Wells Fargo. The letter advised Wells Fargo would not be able to do anything. Wells Fargo advised they followed my instructions when I initiated the transfer but they can not guarantee any goods or services provided by the recipient. I contacted Wells Fargo and spoke to a manger. I advised him I received the letter and disagreed. I told the manager I contacted Wells Fargo right after I made the transfer because I suspected fraud/scam. I told the manger, Wells Fargo told me to wait 24 hours before I report the fraud. The manger told me to contact the person who I bought the tickets from and I told the manger the number was fake. I told the manger the person changed his numbers multiple times. I told the manger there was no one to contact. I told the manger I contacted Wells Fargo due to these reasons. The manager told me it was not a fraud and he could do nothing else. I hung up the phone and decided to walk into a branch to discuss in person. The first week of XXXX I went to my local Wells Fargo in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NY ) and spoke to a representative. The representative was very helpful.

I told the representative I have never reported a fraud/scam before. I also advised I contacted the bank a few minutes after I suspected it was a fraud when I never received a response from the person selling the tickets. I also told the representative that Wells Fargo told me to wait 24 hours before I report the fraud/scam to see if I received the tickets. Because of this I felt assured the transaction would be stopped and the money would go back into my account. I told the representative I have pictures of the texts, XXXX postings, and different telephone numbers the person was using as evidence. I told the representative I would provide copies of the evidence as proof. The representative told me he would let me know a decision in a few days. Around XXXX, the representative contacted me. The representative told me Wells Fargo could not do anything. The representative told me he was sorry and disagreed with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo did not attempt to see the evidence or reach out to me. The representative told me that Wells Fargo said to contact the owner of the tickets and try to get a refund. The representative told Wells Fargo there was no owner and the telephone numbers were fake. The representative told me to not give up and keep contacting Wells Fargo.

XXXX is heavily advertised on the WF website and app, which gives the impression that it's a reliable and protected method to send and receive currency. WF didn't appear to care about my complaints. The last WF employee I spoke with said that they would create a WF case ID number for my complaint ( # XXXX ) and that the case management executive office for online banking ( XXXX ) would contact me within 24 hours to further assist me."
1381,"I worked at XXXX XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX, under XXXX XXXX XXXX . I enrolled in the 401K program to start in XX/XX/XXXX. Authorizing Wells Fargo to take {$100.00} every two weeks out of my pay check to go into my 401K account. 

I left the company ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) in XX/XX/XXXX just prior to the hospital moving to another location under the name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Texas. I spoke with a Wells Fargo representative regarding my 401K, and was told "" no need to transfer or take my money out, it could stay in Wells Fargo account and grow Intrest ''. 

Recently I opened an account with Wells Fargo and my Social Security number, date of birth, old address was already in their account for me. At that time I asked the representative what was my 401K amount now? She reported I had a {$00.00} balance. 

I notified The XXXX XXXX, who reffered me to XXXX XXXX the benifit administrator for XXXX. Since XX/XX/XXXX I have constantly spoken with different reprsentatives from Wells Fargo, each one promising to take care of the issue. 

Still no resolution for the {$6400.00} plus interest I placed in this account. In addition, I was told "" Wells Fargo only go back for 7 years '' One representative saying to me "" its been so long I don't know where the money went, with no activity, it probably just went back to Wells Fargo ''. My homestead burned down in XX/XX/XXXX where all my business information, college diploma, and other information was destroyed. Still the XXXX should have old check stubs, as should Wells Fargo regarding an employees information an transactions regarding our accounts."

They are giving us all sorts of false explanation which we do not agree to and need our difference ASAP, this is illegal to deduct this much amount.

When I realized this was a scam, I called Wells Fargo and to my astonishment there is absolutely nothing they can do. I thought at the least they could dispute the transaction or file a claim. I feel very unsecure now with my own bank, and am at a loss as to where to turn. Being able to feel helped and secure by a bank is very important to me. I am just a have never been scammed before and being my first time, Wells Fargo has not be helpful in the least bit."
1387,"On XX/XX/21 at XXXX MST I attempted to make a mobile transfer from my checking account, using the Wells Fargo app "" XXXX '', to my girlfriend so that she could pay some of her bills before they were due. The app failed to complete this transaction in a very disturbing manner ( see screenshot below ). The message read, in part, "" Please don't resend the payment until you receive our email. We'll let you know if it could not be sent ''. First off, I NEVER received an email and second, when I called later that night to find out what happened to the transfer I was told by a Wells Fargo rep : "" There was no evidence of a pending or declined transaction ''. This app is severely under-supported and the lack of QA in beta is abhorrent. Furthermore, as a result of this failed transaction and Wells Fargo 's faulty app "" XXXX '' my girlfriend was met with late fees for not being able to pay the bills for which I was sending money. I will never send money ever again using this ridiculous app and someone at Wells Fargo needs to be made aware that their proprietary app "" XXXX '' does NOT work."
1388,"I received a text from Wells Fargo Bank around XXXX Friday morning XX/XX/XXXX and then I got a call from Wells Fargo Bank Fraud Department XXXX with Wells Fargo XXXX ). A guy by the name of XXXX, said he was calling from Wells Fargo Bank Fraud Department and wanted to check to see if I was trying to charge XXXX transactions amount at XXXX in XXXX, Florida. XXXX for {$430.00} and the other was for {$580.00}. He asked if I was on vacation. I told him NO, Im home in XXXX, CA and on the phone with and those were not my charges. 

He proceeded to say that he will start a Fraud claim on those 2 transactions. I said, good, its not me. He said I should have a text coming from Wells Fargo with a code to authorize the claim, and for me provide him the code to get the claim going. I provided the code and he said, I will put you on hold and get the claim started. I will be right back with the claim # for you. He did the same with the second transaction. As he was processing the XXXX claim, He then informed me that someone is doing a wire transfer to a XXXX XXXX in Florida, and was that me? I told him, Im on the phone with you and Im not on my mobile app or on my laptop. I told him to stop it and denied it becomes it was not me. I said make sure they did they the money wired. He said they didnt, we caught it in time. I asked how much was in my account? He said about {$27000.00}. 
How they trying to wire. He {$25000.00}. I told him to stop it. I did not authorize it, not me. 

He then said we will do a fraud claim for this XXXX one too. Again said Wells Fargo will text me another code for this Fraud claim and will need that code to get the XXXX claim filed. Put me on hold and came back and gave me claim #. He proceed to say that he will put my account on hold/freezed so XXXX XXXX get access for XXXX. Can not use my debit card and can not log into my account. Said someone from the wells Fargo Fraud department online will call me Monday about XXXX to reset my online account and also get me new debit card. 

I believed the guy and didnt check. Everything was Wells Fargo, the XXXX #, the music, the XXXX claims #. He put my account on hold. Went to work as normal Monday morningafternoon came no calls. 

Tuesday morning after a few repairs, stop by my local Wells Fargo Branch about XXXX and spoke to a banker. Gave her all the info and what took placed. She looked into my account and the money was wired and posted Friday, $ XXXX dollars gone from my account. No notes from their Fraud Department.

While speaking to the banker, I was upset and had some concerns about their process security.

My accountnever signed up or done bill pay, never set up wired transfer.

It would been a RED Flag on their end to call me to make sure I was actually doing these things. 

Out of the blues why would this account do that? And for {$25000.00}? Wells Fargo didnt have any good safeguards in place to protect their customer. 

I asked for the XXXX XXXX  XXXX where the money was transfer too? Banker refuse give me info so I can call directly to see if I can stop it. Or if I can get more info so I can file with the police. They put a recall and gave me a claim number and said some will get back to me 3-45 days after they do their investigation. 

Case recall # XXXX Wells Fargo. 
I just got the letter from the bank and they denied my claim. They said it transaction was from a new hardware ( not my phone or my laptop. ) and they are not liable if some have my log id and passcode. 

I at a lost, and I need help. My saving is now gone and not sure what to do. 

Note. 
My debit card has been stolen several times in the last year it was just hacked on XX/XX/XXXX thanksgiving and charged for XXXX new iPhones. I just got the recent card. When they texted and called the their XXXX #. I believed them. 

At this point, {$25000.00} just gone and I have no help on how to resolve this. 

Thanks, XXXX XXXX"
1389,"On XX/XX/23, a scammer called my wife and pretended to be a representative from Wells Fargo. The scammer also called Wells Fargo and pretended to be my wife. The scammer provided my wife 's information to Wells Fargo and Wells Fargo sent an authentication code to my wife 's real phone number on file. The scammer, who pretended to be from Wells Fargo then asked for the authentication code. After my wife provided the authentication code to the scammer, the scammer gave it to the real Wells Fargo representative. However, the scam artist kept giving the wrong verification code to the real Wells Fargo agent, until finally, the correct one was given to the real Wells Fargo agent. 

At some point the scam XXXX logged onto Wells Fargo and submitted 2 wire transfers in the amounts of $ XXXX and $ XXXX. The scam artist then requested from the real Wells Fargo agent to release the funds. The Wells Fargo agent did so. This occurred between XXXX and XXXX. When I got through to the Wells Fargo fraud department at approximately XXXX - XXXX on the same date, the representative from the fraud department stated the funds were already sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX and could not be recalled. 

We submitted a complaint to Wells Fargo in addition to opening the fraud case. Our complaint was that the Wells Fargo employee did not follow the standard safety protocols and released the funds immediately. 

We received a letter from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/23, stating in summary that Wells Fargo is not liable for the wire transfer initiated by the scammer and approved by the Wells Fargo employee. Thus, Wells Fargo will not refund our money. On XX/XX/23, we spoke to the Wells Fargo representative who was overseeing the case and the representative stated that Wells Fargo completed all the verification steps appropriately despite the authentication code not being verified at after several failed attempts and the scammers voice not sounding like a woman. 

When we asked for a copy of the audio between the scam artist and the Wells Fargo employee. Wells Fargo stated they won't release the audio to us or give us a detailed transcript of the conversation that took place without a subpoena. Obviously Wells Fargo is worried about their liability and not the victims in this case."

I saw the {$20000.00} principal payment leave my external account and didn't think anything of it. I have made similar principal payments from this account several times before. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I reviewed my loan statement and noticed the {$20000.00} principal payment was not. I called into Wells Fargo to let them know and gave them more details of the missing payment ( external bank account details, transaction details, etc. ) They had told me that this was applied to the incorrect loan number internally and they would put a rush to resolve the issue due to the time that has passed and high dollar value. They had told me that they submitted a research request and get back to me in a few days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called into Wells Fargo and spoke with someone about the missing payment. After looking into the issue, I was told that there was a research request in but no one had taken action as the request was not clear. After explaining the issue again, they verified that the {$20000.00} payment was applied to the wrong loan. They also said that they would send an updated research request form that would hopefully resolve the issue. When I mentioned that I would like to log a complaint, I was disconnected. 

I do not know where my {$20000.00} went, if I will ever see that money, or how to log a complaint with Wells Fargo. I have lost enough sleep over this and just want this to be resolved."

At that point I began asking for a refund and they are now unreachable via phone or e-mail.

They also tried to have me wire transfer myself {$17000.00} before I realized it was a scam. At which point, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo that evening to file a claim. 

Since then, I have been in regular contact with the bank in an attempt to retrieve my money. I had to submit two different claims processes, which is why the timeline is so long. Each claim needs 10-15 business days to be investigated. On XX/XX/2022, I received provisional credit from the bank, which was reversed on XX/XX/2022, an entire month and a half after the credit was added to my account. It has been an extremely difficult process, and, as a longtime customer of Wells Fargo, I am very upset. They have also had me close my checking account and open a new one when all I want is to retrieve the funds that were unfairly taken from me in an UNAUTHORIZED TRANSFER. 

I communicated to them that I am protected under Regulation E, to which they have responded that they have no knowledge. For reference, I have included the excerpt from the CFPB website below.

"" 5. A third party fraudulently induces a consumer into sharing account access information that is used to initiate an EFT from the consumers account. Does the transfer meet Regulation Es definition of an unauthorized EFT? 

Yes. As discussed in Electronic Fund Transfers Error Resolution : Unauthorized Fund Transfers Question 1, Regulation E defines an unauthorized EFT as an EFT from a consumers account initiated by a person other than the consumer without actual authority to initiate the transfer and from which the consumer receives no benefit. 12 CFR 1005.2 ( m ). Comment 1005.2 ( m ) -3 explains further that an unauthorized EFT includes a transfer initiated by a person who obtained the access device from the consumer through fraud or robbery. Similarly, when a consumer is fraudulently induced into sharing account access information with a third party, and a third party uses that information to make an EFT from the consumers account, the transfer is an unauthorized EFT under Regulation E.

For example, the Bureau is aware of the following situations where a third party has fraudulently obtained a consumers account access information, and thus, are considered unauthorized EFTs under Regulation E : ( 1 ) a third-party calling the consumer and pretending to be a representative from the consumers financial institution and then tricking the consumer into providing their account login information, texted account confirmation code, debit card number, or other information that could be used to initiate an EFT out of the consumers account, and ( 2 ) a third party using phishing or other methods to gain access to a consumers computer and observe the consumer entering account login information. EFTs stemming from these situations meet the Regulation E definition of unauthorized EFTs. ''"

I told the lady that that was very disrespectful. {$500.00} is a lot of money fo ra single mom like me. I was given the money as a gift to get this item. I ended the call. She seemed sarcastic and was unhelpful. I also spoke to the executive office location ( a lady named XXXX ) that had me on the phone with her for 1 hour and approximately 30 mins to tell me she could not get my money back.

1417,"Late XX/XX/XXXXI bid for a XXXX on XXXX. I did not win the bid but the seller reached out to me on XX/XX/XXXX. He told me that he had a second that he wanted to sell if I was interested. We exchanged emails via XXXX and he gave me his phone number and email via an attached business card. Email reference id : [ # XXXXr # ] _ [ # XXXX  # ] XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX - XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX We emailed back and forth a couple of times and had a phone conversation on XX/XX/XXXX. Emails were initially exchanged via email XXXX   as well as the email for the initial payment. I made the negotiated payments in 2 installments of {$1000.00} each. Prior to shipping the item he offered a second device for a discounted price since the ebay bidder fell through. I fell for it and provided payment in additional installments as shown in the banking transaction history. Over the course of the next couple of weeks, there was always an excuse. First he stated that he shipped it but didn't have the shipping label number so we couldn't track it. Then he shipped it again, supposedly, but gave me a tracking number that did not match the size/weight of a single device, let alone two. That "" shipped '' item never showed scanned in. XXXX told me that the post office lost it but recovered it about a week and a half later. XXXX   offered to fly out to XXXX area to bring the computers provided I could make the rest of the payment installments. I did and I do not know if he was actually here in XXXX area, but he was always conveniently not available, phone turned off, or 'just missed ' me. He returned and we still didn't have anything resolved. There were several additional attempts made over the next couple of months ( I have documentation for all of it ) where he said he attempted to send via XXXX XXXX, XXXX, another XXXX  transfer and all supposedly failed. XXXX XXXX he stated he forgot to get the tracker so I couldn't track it, it took. him several days to get that order canceled. We had similar issues with XXXX and XXXX, he stated he transferred but they were never processed and sent over to me. Supposedly, XXXX  's father died, causing delays in the process and then there was another issue with another family member. XXXX told me that a friend was going to manage this for him as he had no time/bandwidth to fix this. Meanwhile, while all of this was going on, I had been emailing his 'fried ' XXXX to try and get resolution on that side. My gut told me that this was the same guy posing to be two different people. Now I am dealing with 'XXXX  ' as the friend and we are repeating the same issues. Supposedly they are being sent but nothing is reaching me. Every time something is supposedly sent, they don't have a tracking number or transaction number. At this moment, it has been over 4 months without any resolution and no refunded monies. I have contacted XXXX to dispute but they said they were unable to help me and that XXXX had to do it, but if I got a police report and the police got involved, they could help. I filed a police report and they told me they couldn't help as it was internet fraud and out of their jurisdiction. I went to XXXX to try and get a resolution and they refused to help me. I then filed a complaint against XXXX with the XXXX to try and get a resolution, at that time they closed the case and told me that they couldn't help me. I filed an XXXX complaint on XX/XX/XXXX and have never heard back. I am at a total loss at this point and my naivety has put me out of a lot of money. The sum is large enough to be a felony, if I understand correctly. I need an advocate on my side who can help fight this and ultimately get XXXX  to reverse the transaction and go after Wells Fargo to get the money from their customer. This shouldn't be that difficult. Please help me!"

Wells Fargo told me there was nothing they could do about it. 
I called the XXXX customer service line, eventually spoke to a live person. XXXX does NOT have a fraud department. I asked to escalate my problem, and they just transferred my call back to Wells Fargo! 
There is NO accountability on the part of XXXX nor Wells Fargo for this fraudulent act. I called the local police to report the incident."

1424,"Wells Fargo has refused to acknowledge its role in my case ( XXXX ). They falsely advertise XXXX as a secure way to transfer money, protected by Wells Fargo.

Furthermore, Wells Fargo employees XXXX XXXX ( Executive Office Case Specialist XXXX ), XXXX XXXX ( Case Specialist for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), and, primarily, XXXX XXXX ( Escalated Complaints Specialist ) have not been responsive to any phone calls and have failed to communicate with me in a polite and just manner.

I was once directed to a different Escalated Complaints Specialist who rudely told me I'm wasting my time and it's my fault and I can try all my life to get a response but I won't get one. No one has been kind or helpful, only rude and cold, trying to avoid my calls or admit their responsibility in this problem. It's terrible customer service and deceptive marketing.

For Wells Fargo to take responsibility for their terrible customer service and deceptive marketing. Wells Fargo should not affiliate with a third party they do not back ( XXXX ). I would like a reimbursement for my unprotected transactions with XXXX as I was deceived into thinking it was secure."

On XX/XX/XXXX I found myself locked out of my Wells Fargo App and the Wells Fargo Website. Upon contacting them, customer service vaguely transferred me to their Fraud department where I was asked if I could account for the reason for the three transfers. I stated they were probably from my ex-boyfriend, as I could not access my accounts at that time to look at the said transfers she rattled off since I was still locked out of account access, to pay bills such as rent. She asked what his name might be and I confirmed. She then proceeded to tell me that my extra-boyfriend has claimed that these legitimate XXXX transfers made two and three months prior were reported as fraudulent by my ex boyfriend to his bank, XXXX XXXX. I said that they were clearly legitimate, looking at prior history of him sending me money, would demonstrate that. She took me that it would be investigated by Wells Fargo and they would go back and forth with XXXX  XXXX regarding the matter, making it seem that my bank would protect Me from a man who had already tried to steal {$200.00} from my Wells Fargo Checking account just two weeks earlier, causing me to open a new checking account to try to ensure my funds would be safe. The next day, XX/XX/XXXX, I would up to see that {$520.00} was missing from my Wells Fargo Checking account. They revised the XXXX transfers and released the funds back to XXXX XXXX to give back to my ex boyfriend. He is running a scam and Wells Fargo assisted him in doing so. I have plenty of evidence which demonstrates that the mere act of reporting these legitimate XXXX transfers as fraud two and three months after the fact is indeed an act of fraud committed against me and Wells Fargo is refusing to return my {$520.00} they took from me. I am looking to get help. This isnt right and one of their condescending managers essentially hung the phone up on me the other day."

The agents name was foreign sounding XXXX XXXX and I knew nothing about him except that I was to go through him for XXXX XXXX to get his consignment so XXXX XXXX could pay me back the previous loans he had gotten from me. The day the wire was sent it was confiscated by US Treasury Dept. specially the OFAC ( a terrorist division ). They have held the money since then.

1427,"On XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I got a call from Wells Fargo fraud number saying that there was suspicious activity on my business checking account. They said that my card was attempting to be used at a XXXX in XXXX. They also said that a wire transfer was being initiated. They had all of my information from Wells Fargo to include all of my recent transactions and the last wire transfer that I had done. They put me on hold several times and kept asking if I knew an XXXX XXXX and I kept telling them no. I got suspicious at that point and pulled into the Wells Fargo branch on XXXX and XXXX. The teller told me to hang up the phone immediately and call the fraud department. By that point, they had already wired {$23000.00} out of my business checking account. 

I received emails during the fraud call. One was received at XXXX as a notification that my email password had been changed. Then, at XXXX saying that a wire transfer recipient had been added. 

At called the Wells Fargo fraud department at XXXX and stayed on the phone with them for XXXX minutes. they froze my business account and opened p a fraud case. 

On XXXX at XXXX XXXX  I called Wells Fargo back to see if there were any updates. At this point, the rep said that I should be getting a Letter of Affidavit in the mail that I would have to get notarized and return to Wells Fargo. The original call on XXXX never mentioned anything about a letter of affidavit. 

I got off the phone and called back at XXXX to see if I could get any additional information. At this point, they provided no help. 

On XX/XX/14 I had not received a letter of affidavit from the bank, or any information as to where the case was. I went into the XXXX XXXX branch. The representative got on the phone and called the claim department to get an update. He told me that I should be receiving the letter in the mail that day. He also told me to file a police report which is the first mention of a police report needing to be filed since the process had started. 

I left the bank and filed a police report with XXXX Police Dept. The case # is XXXX. 

I did not receive the letter that day, but I Idid receive a letter from Wells Fargo saying they were going to close the claim as it was clear that I initiated at the transfer. Which was clearly not the case. At which point, XXXX XXXX, I got back on the phone with the Wells Fargo fraud department. They were no help whatsoever. I was on the phone with them for XXXX hour and XXXX minutes. The rep said that she had put in a request for the investigator to call me back in the next XXXX hours. They also said that the would put another Letter of Affidavit in the mail since I never received the first one. The next day I called again as I had not heard from anyone. The rep said that they would put in another request to escalate the case and have the investigator call me. 

At this point, I had heard of a colleague that the same thing happened to. I reached out to her and told her my full story. She was shocked, as it was the same line ( someone is trying to use your card in a XXXX in XXXX ) same name on the wire ( XXXX XXXX ) and same transfer bank ( XXXX ) exactly like her scam. She told me to file with XXXX, FBI and FTC. I filed the complaint with FTC XXXX an called FBI. 

The next day, I reached out to someone in the marketing department at Wells Fargo and provided the full story. He also said that he would escalate the case. I received a call from the complaint department that they said they were also going to escalate the case and would keep me posted. Thursday, I had not heard from anyone, nor did I receive the letter of Affidavit. On Friday, I had not heard from anyone, nor did I receive the letter of affidavit. At which point, I went back into the branch. I was on the phone as was the representative. On my end, I asked that the case be escalated once again and to have another Letter of Affadavit sent. The representative kept getting transferred throughout Wells Fargo. After 1 hour and 15 minutes, the representative finally got off the phone and told me that since it was online fraud that Wells Fargo is not responsible and that I would have to go to small claims court."
1428,"Last Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I was looking to purchase 2 tickets to a XXXX XXXX basketball game. I found a listing that had great seats for {$100.00} a ticket, and went ahead and messaged the person. I had a good conversation with them, they sent me proof that they had the tickets, and everything seemed fine. 

I asked what they wanted to do for payment, and they said they didn't wan na do XXXX because it caused a huge headache for them last year with a hack. They'd prefer to do XXXX. I was hesitant here because I know that XXXX has the best protection and I messaged my concern to the seller. I also asked if I could send {$100.00} for the first ticket, then he sends the first ticket, then I send the rest of the money, and he sends the second ticket. This way I could have a little bit of security. He didn't reply for a couple hours, so I messaged him for an update. He told me he didn't feel comfortable doing that and gave me best of luck finding seats. 

I figured that he had to be legit at this point. If he was scamming me, wouldn't he have just taken the {$100.00} and left? So I messaged him again and agreed to do it all at once over XXXX. Now since XXXX is through the banks, and is linked to social security numbers and identities, I figured that if I was being scammed it would be easy to reverse the payment and find the person. He told me he was already lining up something with someone else. I offered {$120.00} a ticket and begged him a little to sell to me. He agreed. 

I sent the payment through Wells Fargo XXXX, ended up sending {$250.00} total, he messaged me that we was transferring the tickets, and they never came. Tried calling/texting him but no answer. 

The phone number he used to text me was XXXX The XXXX name was XXXX XXXX and Phone number was XXXX"
1429,"I tried to open an XXXX  account with Wells Fargo in XXXX of 2020 and after multiple attempts and being denied with no real reason we finally got approved but we're not allowed to open the account via our local branch and they told us we were flagged and never gave us a reason. it had nothing to do with the XXXX And our compliance ( XXXX XXXX XXXX company, XXXX XXXX. we have never got to open and we feel that they didn't not allow us to reopen due to them being able to force the local area to open accounts to cash checks which they are know to have bad practices with making accounts and up holding good customer relations relating to banking fees."

1432,"I sent a wire transfer {$1400.00} to a scammer and I did not know beforehand on XX/XX/XXXX at Wells Fargo bank. The scammer name is XXXX XXXX XXXX and she has an account at Wells Fargo as well. I have contacted the police department with a case number. Unfortunately, they said its up to the bank decision. I understand that once a wire transfer sent then it would not be possible to recall. The policy said the scammer has to accept the recall and I think this is not reasonable. It is a similar situation like when someone trying to rob me and took my wallet. And I have to get their permission to get it back. Do you think this is reasonable? Thank you."
1434,"On XXXX I used my WellsFargo bank app to send XXXX US dollars from my checking account to my second cousin in XXXX, to his checking account. 
I was told that the money will arrive on XXXX of XXXX. On XXXX of XXXX money was still not received and I felt so embarrassed and told my cousin who is in his XXXX, that he will get the money soon. I called my bank and was given a case number XXXX, and with information that they will get back to me soon. I kept calling them, called on XXXX, talked with XXXX, she will send a note again.

No update but after I asked to speak with some supervisor, I was connected with XXXX who told me that a new case number is assigned XXXX, and someone will call me by Friday, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX No one called and no one explained this far why it was taking so long or what was the issue. I sent the money to my cousin via XXXX XXXX on XXXX as he needed the money and I had promised him to send the money. 
On XXXX XXXX I called again and talked with XXXX, who gave me another case number XXXX. She told me she will get back to me in XXXX hours. She also informed me that there was some compliance hold. This was the first time someone told the such thing. This is just not right. I understand compliance hold for security but I should have been informed by XXXX so I could inform my cousin who may be thinking that I was not sending the money. Very embarrassing."

I called and left a message for XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX called me back, and she ultimately couldn't find my funds and where the funds went. 

From there, XXXX exculated the matter and an Executive XXXX XXXX is working on what he does and told him that Wells Fargo has damaged me, and I need to be compensated for the loss of taking care of my private affairs."
1439,"I cashed a check of {$4900.00} to my Wells Fargo account ending in XXXX on XX/XX/2020. I called Wells Fargo to let them know if was a fraud check and they indicated I could not cancel the pending mobile deposit. 
The check was deposited and I was given the {$4900.00}. Why was I given {$4900.00} if the check was fraud? It wasn't even from a real bank. How does Wells Fargo allow this for their customers? There is no safety for customers if that is the case. The money ending up getting reversed due to Wells Fargo not taking action when I told them ( on a recorded line ) that it was fraudulent. They did close my account and took action on my account ending in XXXX but NOT my checking account ending is XXXX. This would have not happened if they would have took my voiced concerns of fraud and safety when I called to tell Wells Fargo about the fraudulent check. I have received a letter from Wells Fargo denying my request for a {$2000.00} reimbursement ( see attached ) due to further investigation on a claim ( XXXX ). I have called the claims department several times to let them know that this transaction was NOT authorized. I was given a letter indicating that Wells Fargo combined all of my claims into one claim. There was a reson why I submitted multiple claims. I am aware as a customer I had told Wells Fargo that I sent two XXXX  transactions as instructed but the {$2000.00} was NOT apart of the charity or donations. Again, I told Wells Fargo that several times. 
I submitted a claim in the amount of {$1700.00} that was sent to a charity due to a job offer I took. The employer was a scam, he said he would pay me if I worked for him ( which I did what I was supposed to do ) and they ended up reversing the check. 
I was told I would receive the {$2000.00} from Wells Fargo and that the CASE WAS CLOSED on XX/XX/2020. 
Why was the case reopened? I am again requesting my {$2000.00} to be reimbursed into my account. I was told several times by Wells Fargo when I tried to get it reconsidered that "" since the case is closed, there are no options to edit it. '' So why does Wells Fargo get to chose when to re-open a claim? Wells Fargo should not have closed the claim if they knew they had further investigation. I also never informed Wells Fargo to consolidate my claims. The {$2000.00} was not authorized and that was for merchandise that I purchased and never received along with the {$950.00} claim ( but this was got approved. ) This makes no sense why my latest claim got approved but this one did not. Please see attached for the letter sent to me from Wells Fargo. This is unacceptable."
1440,"I purchased tickets on XX/XX/2018 from XXXX using {$120.00} from a XXXX account tied to my Wells Fargo checking account. Scammer seemed genuine with name, email and phone, even calling. The funds were immediately accessed and no tickets forthcoming. I contacted Wells Fargo within about 2 hours of the purchase. Wells Fargo indicates they have no responsibility since I authorized the transaction. XXXX indicates I have to go through Wells Fargo. In researching this appears a new, common scam that should be more publicized through both XXXX  and Wells Fargo. These funds should be protected just as other funds that are fraudulently obtained."
1441,"on XX/XX/2022 I got two emails stating that I had "" successfully added a wire transfer recipient AND that I had recently submitted a wire transfer for {$3500.00} '' and that if I did not submit this transfer, to call Wells Fargo at XXXX, which I did IMMEDIATELY! 
I have NEVER authorized a wire transfer from my account and I do not know the recipient!!!

1448,"Good Afternoon. I am reaching out to you in hopes that my situation gets attention and that I can receive help. On Monday XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX I shipped a computer system for {$1600.00} to someone in Oregon. this person made me believe that he had paid me thru XXXX in order for me to ship the Computer. But this was not the case. I never received any funds and instead the same user posted himself as a XXXX representative. Later on, the that same night I received a fake email from XXXX stating that I had to wait until the parcel was delivered before I could receive the funds. ( {$1600.00} ). On Friday XX/XX/2020 The buyer received the computer, and I received a notification from the same Fake XXXX. Stating that my account had a limited and that the buyer had to send me the amount of {$3000.00} in order for my account to expand. Moments later I received a text from the buyer regarding the {$3000.00}. He agreed the send these in order to expand my account. when he did I received a notification in regards to those {$3000.00} stating that I had to send the buyer their {$3000.00} back via any other platform except XXXX. At this point I'm just thinking of doing the right thing and I send her {$2500.00} from my XXXX XXXX XXXX  Account and {$500.00} from my wells Fargo Savings account. via XXXX. as soon as I did I was expecting "" XXXX '' to deposit the sum of {$4700.00} that they stated was going to be credited in to my account = {$1600.00} from the computer, {$100.00} XXXX service fee and {$3000.00} that the sender supposedly had sent. When logging in to my XXXX account. these funds where nowhere to be seen. so i contacted XXXX thru the original app and they responded confirming that the XXXX that has been supposedly claiming to be XXXX was a fake account. at this point I got really upset and did not know what to do when I realized that I had lost {$3000.00} worth of saving and my computer. 
I decided to call my banks on XX/XX/2020 to see if they could reverse the transactions. They agreed to take my claim but stated that there is no guaranteed that I will receive my funds back. I really broke me the thought of not getting those funds and specially during this Covid-19 situation. I tried calling the buyer but the line appears to be disconnected. If you need a copy of any of this, I have all of this available."
1452,"A lady sent me a message "" by accident '' through XXXX. I tried to redirect her to the probable correct area code, and she thought I very nice to do that and started chatting with me. After several days of nice chatting, she mentioned that she was working with some computer installation people, and invited me to try a little Crypto Trading on the XXXX webste. It sounded harmless enough, and she led the way by providing Screenshots with every spot to click on identified, and she made the Trading experience fun and very profitable, by her following a sequence of trend lines and buying/selling nodes, and instructing me when to buy or sell various types of crypto. We usually traded XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and we did exceptionally well. About 2 weeks in, she guided me to withdraw {$5000.00}, and that process went well. She often encouraged me to add more Principle so I could make bigger profits. I told her I was fine with the current profits at that time, and she finally convinced me to invest more in early XXXX. By the last week in XXXX, my assets were up to {$890000.00}. She said she wanted to teach me how to withdraw funds, and asked me to withdraw it all. I tried to do it, and forgot my Fund Password, and needed to change it. Because I did that, XXXX said that it triggered a possible scam or hacker alert, and that I would need to Deposit 25 % of my Assets to ensure that it was me operating the account. they stated that the 25 % Deposit would be part of my withdrawal. Because I had just inherited some funds from my late XXXX, I was able to pay another {>= $1,000,000} to prove that I was me. Again I tried to make a Withdrawal, and then they asked for another 5 % of my Total assets so they could collect the Personal Income Tax on my withdrawal and forward it to the IRS. I tried to explain that Personal Income Tax is paid on Income or XXXX XXXX, not on my Cost basis or additional Fees or Deposits. Unfortunately their Online Customer Service Computer was incorrectly programmed, and it repeatedly said the 5 % Personal Income Tax was based on the Total Assets. As there is NO Human interaction available to support their Online Customer Service system, paying another {$50000.00} was out of the question. I invested a total of {$300000.00}, + the {$220000.00} Security Deposit for a total of {$520000.00}. I am just sick over this, and have lost most of my life savings. I had transferred all of my funds using my Bank - Wells Fargo. Not once did Wells Fargo warn me against the investment nor did they question my sudden changes in the way i withdrew and made big investments."
1453,"This complaint is a follow up to complaint number XXXX. 

Wells Fargo Bank NA did not address the main point of the above referenced complaint in their letters of XX/XX/XXXX & XXXX, XXXX. I did respond to their letters, on XX/XX/XXXX, pointing out their failure to understand and address my complaint, which is the refusal of Wells Fargo to recognize that the facts as presented to them, have created a dispute about the unauthorized electronic transfer of funds, as described in Regulation E of the 1978 EFTA. 

I am awaiting a reply from Wells Fargo to my letter dated, XX/XX/XXXX requesting that the bank accept the legal fact that, under Regulation E, there is a dispute between a financial institution and a poor American consumer.

Up to the date of the filing of this complaint, Wells Fargo has not responded to my reply to their letters. Therefore, I am requesting that the relevant authority at the cfpb, issue a notice of charges alleging a violation of the consumer protection statue, known as Regulation E, which forms part of the Federal EFTA of 1978. My prayer is that such a notice would initiate an Administrative Adjudication Proceeding before the Administrative Agency Tribunal as soon as possible. 

It has been almost one year since the unauthorized transfers of the {$18000.00} took place. Wells Fargo disregarded our affidavits along with other evidence showing that the transfers were not authorized by me or anyone else known to me. I provided every relevant evidence to support the type of financial situation reflected in Regulation E, the statute that assists the consumer ; However, Wells Fargo refused to reverse their decision that says, that I or someone known to me, made the transfers or authorized someone else to do so. They have declared the cases as closed. 

The purpose of this complaint is to legally make charges alleging a violation of the consumer protection statute known as Regulation E. I am looking for a ruling in my favor from an administrative judge. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX, consumer."
1456,"The following is the narrative of the emails that I sent to Wells Fargo Corporate office and the branch manager where the wire transfer took place. 

I am the victim of internet fraud by way of wire transfer of {$51000.00} at one of your branches in XXXX, MN on XX/XX/2022. 
I was on the internet when there was a loud audible and visual pop-up warning from XXXX stating there was illegal activity going on in my computer and that they had frozen my computer. There was a phone number to call. I tried to call a number that I had for XXXX and a recording said that I could only get help online. I tried other ways to get a number, but to no avail so I ended up calling the number on the screen. I first spoke with XXXX who transferred me to XXXX XXXX, one of XXXX 's senior IT specialists. He had me download "" XXXX XXXX '' to get my permission to take control of my computer to "" fix the issues '' and clean out the computer. I've had XXXX do this before, so I didn't think anything of it. He showed me a list of what the hackers were looking at and of course, my banking information was at the top of the list. He had me sign on to my Wells Fargo account to make sure everything looked OK. Then he would put me on hold at which time I would see him doing all kinds of different things and different screens that I wasn't familiar with but that looked like he was cleaning things up. Also, during that time he would come back on the phone to say that it was taking longer due to XXXX 's servers going down while he was cleaning up my computer. He was very apologetic as it kept happening. He said that XXXX would give me a refund of {$520.00}, the amount I paid for the software when I originally bought the computer. He had me type in my name and the amount myself but somehow, the amount got changed to {$52000.00}, off 2 decimal points. He was freaking out and said that he was going to get fired. The money was indeed in my checking account. 
He said that I needed to go to my bank and wire the money back to XXXX in the amount of {$51000.00} which is the {$52000.00} minus the refund XXXX was giving me. He told me to wire the money to XXXX XXXX. I questioned the use of an XXXX, and he said that XXXX being a big company, uses them all the time. He also told me to tell the banker that it was for an investment. The banker, XXXX XXXX at the branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MN XXXX, only asked what it was for. I told him that it was for an investment. I remember thinking that when I wired money to my brother at XXXX, they would give me the 3rd degree and we even have the same last name! They did much more due diligence in protecting me over transfers as little as {$300.00} than Wells Fargo did over {$51000.00} to an LLC! Also, I would think that the banker would also have been suspicious of not only the large amount but also the odd amount as well as the use of an LLC. That and me being a little gray haired old lady with elder fraud running rampant. 
XXXX XXXX tried to get me again. This time I was supposed to wire {$99000.00} but I caught it and transferred it back into my Home Equity Line of Credit after getting a call the evening of XX/XX/XXXX from Wells Fargo alerting me of 2 transfers out of my Home Equity account. I am thankful for that. The man that I spoke to said that he was going to open a fraud claim and that I would receive a fraud packet in the mail. I've never used that account and kind of forgot I had it. 
Now about that fraud claim. I received a letter from the Fraud Claim Dept. on XX/XX/2022 stating that they couldn't reverse the online transfers because the account was closed. Of, course, the account was closed. Wells Fargo immediately closed all of my accounts and opened new ones! I called the number on the letter. He said that there was no proof of any fraud. I said that I was told 3 times that I would get a fraud packet in the mail which was never received and asked if a police report would help. He said yes and to fax that and also copies of phone records to the fraud dept. I've attached this letter along with my rebuttal on it. I faxed everything to Online Fraud Claims XX/XX/2022. I called the Fraud Department on XX/XX/2022 to get an update. I was told that the documents were received and reviewed. I called again on XX/XX/2022 and spoke to XXXX in the Fraud Dept. She said rather rudely that the case was closed because I authorized that wire transfer. I told her that I didn't authorize the online transfer of money from my Line of Credit to my checking account. When we were talking about it, she said in a condescending way, "" Well, that should have been a big red flag! '' I have had so many issues trying to get things straightened out over this whole ordeal including simple things like having to try 3 times to get new checks and twice to get a new debit card having cash be my only option. This has been very traumatic, stressful and XXXX  for me. I've been a very good Wells Fargo customer for a very long time. Please help me by taking this seriously to make me whole by reversing the transfer. 

Thank you very much, XXXX XXXX XXXX I have yet to hear from them."
1459,I bought a phone from a guy on XXXX. I sent him the money on Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX and he said he'll ship the phone on the upcoming Friday which was the XX/XX/XXXX. He told me he sent the phone and I asked him for the shipping information and he said he would give it to me. The next day I still didn't get the information and I texted and called over the next few days with no response. Today is XX/XX/XXXX and there's no sign of the phone or the guy I bought it from. It looks like I got scammed.
1461,"I was sent a check to supposedly pay for equipment for a new job. I was told to send the money to the vendors. The check was sent by people who are scamming and the check was returned. I called my bank Wells Fargo and they told me there was nothing they can do and that I had to pay the funds back, which I do not have. I keep telling them I was scammed and was just told that it didnt matter because I had deposited the check. The suppose company sent me a check of {$3800.00} then they proceeded to send me another one of XXXX, I did not deposit it because I was sketched out, once I told them what I knew they were doing the messages disappeared, we were messaging via XXXX. 
This is what they sent me, through text messages- XXXX XXXX  XXXX Hello, my name is XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX, your resume has been approved by our company from XXXX for a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX The pay is $ XXXX. For more information, download XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and contact the HR Manager by clicking XXXX XXXX XXXX or by searching his ID XXXX XXXXXXXX and send a message to him for more info about the job and company. Your interview code is XXXX Text STOP to end Everything looked legitimate even the paperwork, that I was told to sign."
1463,A trusted friend recommended me as well as a group of trusted family friends to an investor who promised to return our money about 2 weeks after we initially sent. He has hacked into the bank accounts of some people involved since then and has not returned anyones money. We have clearly been frauded. He made written agreements in text of when he was returning the money and it has been about XXXX months.
1466,"I was the victim of a XXXX XXXX. I saw an ad for a XXXX excavator on craigslist. 
I called the number on the ad. After talking to the man and doing some checking on XXXX I decided it was legitimate. I arranged a loan at XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Oklahoma. They did a little checking on their own and they decided it was okay. On XXXX the XXXX they wired {$40000.00} to Wells Fargo Bank in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The business name was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. The man said he would deliver the machine the next Friday. Of course I never heard from him again. I have contacted various branches of the law. FBI, The Federal Trade Commission. The Oklahoma XXXX XXXX XXXX. Sheriff departments in Oklahoma and Ohio. I have heard from none of them. The bank in XXXX XXXX returned around {$5700.00} to the XXXX XXXX Bank in XXXX have not divulged the name of the individual who had the account in XXXX XXXX. The XXXX list XXXX registered agents as the agent. I called them and they cant give the name of the owner of the company. I assume this is someone overseas but if not I feel like something needs to be done to deal with this situation."
1467,"I initiated a transaction for a few hundred dollars on the end of Wells Fargo. The payment posted but The payment later disappeared off of my account. The payment was not pending, it was completed. Wells Fargo initiated a three way call with my other bank, XXXX XXXX to ensure the funds were posted and completed. XXXX XXXX confirmed this and provided a trace number, quoting it may be stuck with the federal reserves. Wells Fargo is telling me that the removal of funds is illegal on their part and they would work diligently to fix it. They have been extremely helpful but partly I feel as though this is done because they understand they are in the wrong. It was later confirmed that the funds were showing in their back office but for some reason it was not posted as fund received even though XXXX XXXX confirmed funds were sent. They escalated the issue because it may be a  system error. I have heard of illegal wellsfargo activity in the past and I just wanted to know my options or at least whistle blow when I notice illegal activity. I believe light should be shed on this issue. It has been three business days. I posted the amount that was taken from my XXXX XXXX. His also caused overdrafts in my Wells Fargo accoun"
1468,"On XX/XX/2019 I made a payment in the amount of {$31000.00} into an account called XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, who banks with Wells Fargo.

I called my bank, they sent Wells Fargo an electronic bank to bank message requesting them to please verify that the funds were received. After I believe 2 messages, I called my bank and requested that they start the process of having Wells Fargo of return the {$31000.00}. Every three ( 3 )  days XXXX XXXX XXXX sends a message, and every time I call, they have received nothing back from the bank. Wells Fargo already got into trouble creating accounts in the names of their customers, without their knowledge, and here they are playing some game again! Since they can not verify that they received the money, I want my {$31000.00} back. I am not waiting for them to finally decide to respond. I want them to return my {$31000.00}! This has been going on since at least the XXXX of XXXX. It's going on two months.

The money was sent out 2 days ago on XX/XX/2022. I would like to ask CFPB to take necessary action to protect my funds that had been transfered to the scammer. 

The fraud is a rent fraud. I saw scammer posted XXXX rental offer, and got in touch with the scammer. After a long conversation with the scammer, I signed the lease agreement, and use wire transfer to pay the deposit and first month and last month rent. 

During the whole process, I only contact the scammer via email. The scammer are using the identity of XXXX XXXX, and provided me a driver license copies for it. The seamer keep pushing me to sign the lease agreement and ask me to pay the deposit and first and last month rent to secure the unit. 

I initiated the wire transfer to scammer provided wells fargo bank account on XX/XX/2022, and the wire transfer completed by 2 days ago on XX/XX/2022. Today, XX/XX/2022, the scammer using text message to contact me to ask if I cancel the transfer or not.

My bank later got back to me and made me realize someone tried to hack into my bank account but was not successful, my account is still under review but the funds in it is safe. Just wanted to let you know. 

The move in process is on and I am so sorry I didn't get back to you since morning, there has been this little problem. I have been trying to trash out with the homeowner and property lawyer and I don't know how to put it to you. 

There are XXXX other applicants trying to rent this same unit and XXXX of them is willing to pay 3 months rent plus deposit upfront and the other is willing to pay 6 months rent plus deposit upfront. But thats not even your concern though The homeowner ( XXXX ) reach out to me asking that you pay 3 months rent plus deposit. I did not agree with, due to the fact that i already had a certified lease agreement with you and you already made payment as we have agreed. 

He said it's all my fault that I should have insisted you pay 3 months plus deposit or I should have asked you to pay 6 months if possible and you get a discount on the rent. 

So now I would like to plead with you out of your inconveniences that if you can please afford to pay the additional XXXX months rent. 

I understand this might not be convenient for you but I would implore if youre able to come to an agreement with this new developments because I really do not wish that you miss out on this place. 

kindly get back and let me know so I can provide you with the payment details to send the additional XXXX months rent. 

I can assure you that nothing will affect the previous agreement and payment you made. The owner just preferred you pay 3 months plus deposit instead of the first and last plus deposit you paid.

1481,"I had made a recall request to the bank in order to recall transfers that I inadvertently made to a fraudulent merchant. 
The details of the transfers are as follows : Amount Currency Transaction Date Sending Bank Receiving Bank Beneficiary XXXX USD XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX USD XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX USD XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX USD XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX USD XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX I was contacted by a company that identified itself to me as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was instructed to send these funds to specific beneficiaries. The merchant claimed that the funds from these transfers would be used to fund the brokerage/investment account they provided. At the time, the merchant presented this information as if the beneficiary was actually them. 
I didn't receive the service. The merchant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX claims to be a broker and provides a self-directed brokerage/investment account with the ability to trade financial instruments ( stocks, CFDs, Binary Options, commodities, etc. ) and with the ability to withdraw funds on request. This was the service I paid for. But this company doesn't have a license for brokerage / investment services and is unable to have ever provided any brokerage / investment account. because all companies ( the merchant and beneficiaries ) don't have a license for brokerage / investment services, they can't provide me with the service I paid for. 
XXXX XXXX against WellsFargo bank Since initiating these transfers, I have determined that the named beneficiary does not actually have any type of connection to the merchant at all. The terms and conditions provided on the merchants website list the client agreement as being between the merchant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and myself. The name of the beneficiary to whom the funds were transferred by bank wire is not listed on the merchants website. 
It has recently been brought to my attention that there is not any connection between the merchant and the beneficiary to whom the funds were transferred. 
That is why I asked my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, to start the wire recall procedure. My bank sent the wire recall request to the beneficiary bank Wells Fargo several times, but the beneficiary bank Wells Fargo hasnt replied. 
After that my lawyer sent a Legal Letter to the beneficiary bank Wells Fargo. ( I have attached the Legal letter ) The beneficiary bank Wells Fargo hasnt replied to the lawyer as well. 
I believe that the beneficiary bank Wells Fargo is associated with this fraud and money laundering. I ask for your help in my case, I ask you to check the beneficiary bank Wells Fargo and I ask you to contact the beneficiary bank Wells Fargo so that they review my case."
1482,"On XX/XX/21 I had been talking with a company that I was planning on working for for over 4 days and they sent me an online check for {$4500.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in order to pay for various hardware and software products I would need for the job. This money would then be sent to their vendor in order to purchase these items. This company had interviewed me and I trusted them for the most part since we had been taking for a while. I deposited the check that day and waited. The following day I checked my WellsFargo account and the check appeared to have cleared, as my balance had gone up by {$4500.00}, giving me the impression that there was no hold up. I then payed the vendor I was instructed to pay, sending them 4 installments of {$1000.00} XXXX through XXXX XXXX. Shortly after this took place, I deposited a second check for {$4500.00} which was placed on hold almost immediately. It was this same day ( XX/XX/21 ) I noticed my balance had dropped by by $ XXXX because of the payments but the check that had originally cleared was now placed on hold as well. At this point I knew I had been scammed but what was most frustrating was the damage it caused. My monthly rent, which I was about to pay, was taken and I received no compensation from Wells Fargo what so ever even after filing two claims of fraud and filing a police report. I was told the claim was denied simply for the fact that it was a wire transfer. Wells Fargo themselves had shown the check as cleared which was the only reason I made the payments in the first place. Ive sent all the conversations and emails I had with the scammer to Wells Fargo claim department but that seemed to do no good either. As both claims were still denied"

I contacted XXXX to see if they could track down some information, and they said to us that the account that XXXX put the money into ended with a totally different account number to which it was sent into, that account is completely unknown to my friend and he does not have any account ending with account that XXXX specified that XXXX put the money into. 
We have contacted Wells Fargo multiple times to find out where my money went to and they have yet to tell us what happened or where my money is. My belief is that Wells Fargo may be using XXXX to perform some kind of wire fraud or other types of fraud."

1489,"I was scammed by this person. He sent me a check for {$3100.00} and then asked me to send money to some people through XXXX from Wells Fargo and also get some gift cards for them. I filled a complaint on XX/XX/2020 to the bank and they said the check was fake. 
On XX/XX/2020 they said they can't refund me my money because this was a scam and they can't help. They didn't help me to track the transactions as well. I went to Wells Fargo bank in XXXX and they told me to contact their customer service and they said they can't help with a scam."
1490,"When : Between XX/XX/XXXX2020  Bank : Wellsfargo- transfer using XXXX XXXX  payments : 3 Wellsfargo contacted : XX/XX/2020 to report XXXX transactions ... no resolution other than replacement of card which I submitted online. 

Monday, early XXXX on a wim went to search for puppies for sale online. Came across the site XXXX. My daughter picked out "" XXXX '' the XXXX  XXXX  and we simply made in inquiry from the site by filling our our general contact information and what dog we were interested. I instantly received a text message stating an appreciation of our interest in the puppy and that it was available now. We automatically said yes. The seller proceeded to stated the cost of shipment and asked if we wanted to pick it up from the airport or delivered to our residence. We chose to have it delivered to the house. The cost was going to be {$600.00} for the puppy + {$250.00} for resident delivery. We thought it over and continued the conversation for purchase. The seller told me that I could send them money using XXXX. Not being to familiar with XXXX, I went ahead and sent monies to the name XXXX XXXX ( whom I thought was the breeder 's name ) and shared with them a screen shot of the payment ... I learned quickly from my banking institution, that I was given a daily {$500.00} limit. I told the seller and they initially wanted me to then use another form of payment through XXXX. I told them no that I didn't feel comfortable doing a payment that way and told them that I could send the remaining balance 24 hours later. They agreed. Next day later I attempted to send the balance of {$250.00} through XXXX to the same person, XXXX XXXX. and again sent them a screen shot of the payment. Hours later I reached out to the seller to see when the puppy would be sent. Was planned to be sent out Wednesday. We were so excited to see a confirmation email that the sellar had indeed dropped off the puppy at the airport in the hands of XXXX whom was going to be transporting the dog. Someone even contacted me confirming the address that the puppy was to be delivered to. Late afternoon Wednesday, I received an email from the shipping company stating the the crate provided by the sellar would not be suited for travel due to the climate change. The email stated that there were 3 temperature controlled crates to chose from and their prices. Also, that all crate rentals were 100 % refundable upon delivery by cash. flag # 1 I thought, well why didn't the sellar know this and take of or warn me of the chances of this happening ... I went back and forth and decided to take the "" mid grade '' crate that cost {$1100.00} ( give or take a few dollars ). flag # 2 Once I responded to the shipping company of my choice in crates, they went on to say that I was to send the money through XXXX. Well, running into the same problem as I did with the sellar, I had to make it sets of payments ; all to different people .... I was getting more and more worried that I had been scammed and this we would never see this puppy. The shipping company suggested that I try to make the payment balance online through their website. I provided my debit card info and license info and to my luck, the site stated that their payment system was down and that I could not proceed. Well, with only {$100.00} left to pay I decided to lie and say that the payment was made in full and sent a "" preview '' or review of the payment screenshot. No response ... I called the seller, texted the seller, and called the shipping company ... No response. scammed out of $ XXXX"
1491,"I had a series of withdrawals taken from my checking account with Wells Fargo over the course of XXXX XXXX that totaled {$8200.00} in total. These withdrawals were used to fund XXXX. I logged onto my Wells Fargo App a few days after these withdrawals and noticed a message saying the bank has noticed suspicious activity on my account so I called the number they gave me and they read the different transactions and asked if I performed them. I stated no to all of them. I also noticed when checking my account that someone had made a money transfer from my credit card to my checking account totaling {$12000.00} during this same time period. Then whoever was using my information tried multiple times to withdraw that {$12000.00} to XXXX as well. Basically whoever was controlling my information/passwords/device had depleted my checking account and almost maxed out my credit card. I filed claim number XXXX disputing the credit card transfer and claim XXXX regarding the {$8200.00} taken out of my checking account. My initial disputes were both denied so I appealed to the executive office and that was also denied. The person I spoke with from the executive office stated that my appeal was denied because they found that whoever took these funds used my username/password and that it came from my device. There are several issues with this research. The first issue is there are cases where a hacker is able to access a persons phone/computer and make any actions appear that they are coming from that device. The second issue is I have been a customer of Wells FargoXXXX XXXXWachovia for around 20 years and if you look at my transaction history, there has never been a day that I've used my checking account or credit card like that day and at the hours it was used during that day. When I spoke with the person at the Wells Fargo branch about my situation she stated that those transactions don't match up to my profile ( that of someone with a high credit score and who has never done anything like that in the past. ) If Wells Fargo is unwilling to protect their customers from fraud I would recommend to anyone who sees this to put your money in a bank that will actually have your back and not one that is complicit in it being fraudulently taken from you."
1492,"I am a bank signor on my parents checking and savings accounts with Wells Fargo. 

On XXXX my dad was the victim of a remote scam. The fraudsters were able to obtain online banking information. Through a scam, the fraudsters wired out {$2200.00} to themselves. I became aware of this late on XXXX. I immediately called Wells Fargo Customer service to report the fraud. This was at approximately XXXX on XX/XX/21. I do have the name of the customer service representative that I spoke with. The representative and I reviewed the accounts. We were able to see the wire out and two other unauthorized bank transfers from the savings account to the checking account. One for {$2500.00} and one for {$25000.00}. We did not see, any other activity that was unauthorized at this time. The customer service representative supposedly took actions to protect the account at this time. She assured me that she deactivated the online banking capabilities. She also assured me that she deactivated wiring capabilities. She in fact told me that the only way the wire capabilities could be turned back on was if the wire fraud department turned it back on. She then went to file a claim for the fraud. She attempted several times but each time she indicated that the system wasn't letting her. She continued to try but was unsuccessful and told me that I would need to call in or go to the branch in the morning to file a claim. The morning of XXXX, I went to the branch with my parents to file a claim and close out the accounts, and open new accounts. However, much to our surprise, there was a {$15000.00} wire pending for the benefit of the fraudsters. The bank had no answers for how that was possible. We filed a claim and after XXXX XXXX days, the bank denied the claim with no acknowledgement of my contact to customer service on XXXX. I suspect that the customer service representative didn't do her job correctly and the inability to file a claim the night of XXXX allowed the fraudsters to initiate the 2nd wire. My thought is that the {$15000.00} might have already been scheduled when I called in the night of XXXX but wasn't detected. Or the fraudsters scheduled after the accounts were supposedly shut down. In any event, I feel that Wells Fargo is responsible for the {$15000.00} wire that was sent out after they were notified of the fraud. I am now trying to appeal the denial, and have just spent the past 1 1/2 hours being transferred from one department to another. I finally got to the right spot and gave a verbal account of the above information. However, when I asked the representative I was talking to repeat the information I gave her, she did not have all the information I gave her, nor did she have some of the information as I had stated. I really don't have any confidence in this appeal that they took from me."
1493,Cashiers check stolen. Felon altered check and cashed it. Wells Fargo noted check was a fraud and denied deposit. They notified me that my missing check was found and that my money was safe. They said after fraud investigation paperwork was filled out my money will be refunded. XXXX. They have not refunded the money and are not calling me back.
1494,"I wired money to a person who was going to invest it in crypto. My money would mirror his trades. I did {$100000.00} on XX/XX/2022. Then {$50000.00} on XXXX XXXX, then {$50000.00} on XXXX XXXX, and finally a {$30000.00} on XXXX XXXX. All these wires were sent from my Wells Fargo to his XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. It all went to XXXX, where it was transferred to bitcoin and then sent to his crypto wallet : XXXX Please help. Im devastated.

1495,"XX/XX/XXXX & XXXX, 2020 : I received an e-mail message purporting to be from my brother, saying that he needed {$5000.00} for a medical issue, Since he had had a XXXX XXXX  several years back, I didn't question the request. It turns out the request came from someone who had hacked into his computer. I had wired the money to the XXXX XXXX office of Wells Fargo. Shortly afterwards, having learned from my brother that the email was a scam, my local bank representative contacted Wells Fargo and discovered ( a ) that the money was deposited in a Wells Fargo account in XXXX, NY ( my brother lives in XXXX ), and ( b ) that the account was already closed. There are only two ways the false account was set up in my brother ' name : ( a ) an inside job ; or, ( b ) using the information stolen from his account.I have since learning about the scam contacted Wells Fargo ; I have received over the last five and a half months, letters from seven different "" Escalated Complaints Specialists '' from different Wells Fargo locations throughout the country, each saying in a form letter : "" We received your complaint and are committed to promptly addressing your concerns.... It is our goal to review your concerns and provide you with a response within ten business days from the date we received your request. '' Over all these months, I have NEVER received the promised follow-up, nor has any of these so-called Case Specialists ever asked me for information of did any research into this fraud. 

I have 36 pages of history describing the scam and the lack of a follow-up, even though I have sent certified letters/response required. The last letter I sent was to the CEO of Wells Fargo in XXXX XXXX. It was only after a month had lapsed that I received the receipt back UNSIGNED. 
An earlier certified letter was sent to XXXX XXXX yet was received -- according to the USPS -- in XXXX, NY. The signature on the return receipt was illegible, and there was no printed name below the signature. 

So, this is a very brief summery of the wire fraud of which I was a victim. I would be happy to provide you with the complete account in order for you to "" follow the money/fraud. ''"

I did not authorize the transactions to that recipient. The individual receiving was fraudulently using an account. 

Wells Fargo claim Number : XXXX"
1499,"On XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX, I received a text from Wells Fargo Bank Fraud Dept asking if I had made a XXXX transfer for {$1000.00} to XXXX XXXX. I replied no. The message said a customer service representative would contact me soon. Shortly thereafter, I received a call from the Wells Fargo number on the back of my debit card. 
The person told me that money was scheduled to be transferred from my account to XXXX XXXX and I needed to go into XXXX to put the money back into my account. I questioned this but since I had never used XXXX and was somewhat panicked, I went into XXXX and proceeded to enter my phone number as directed. A scam notification came up and the caller said he had just put that on the page to stop any scams. 
He said we would do {$500.00} first and then we would do the other {$500.00}. When I hesitated, he told me to check the number on the back of my card. Thinking this was someone from Wells Fargo, I entered the amount. 
At this time, I asked if he could hold for a moment. I called my husband, who is a retired Wells Fargo employee, on my landline and just as I started to talk, the caller hung up from my cell phone. My husband came in and we immediately called the Wells Fargo number to report the scam. 
We were told that it would take 10 days to be resolved. 
Ive called several times only to be told after 10 days that the recipient institution had been contacted asking for a refund. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told the claim had been denied and closed but could be sent to an escalation process. A customer service representative asked if I wanted to talk to someone in the executive office. I held for over an hour only to find out that the office had closed for the day. The following day, I spoke to someone in the executive office who asked me what did the original claim rep tell me about the provisional credit. I told him I wasnt offered it and he said he had no authority to give me a provisional credit or refund my money and that I should be receiving a letter in the mail. I have spoken to so many different people and all have transferred to someone else that I had to explain over and over what took place."
1501,"On XX/XX/19 I received a text from a company named XXXX XXXX. XXXX from Georgia. We had hired this firm to watch any scams that may effect our computer system about ten months before the actual scam took place. They said they were going out of business and wanted to give us back {$400.00}. dollars but I needed to be at my computer so they could put it in my account. I was at my computer when a man named XXXX called me from phone number ( XXXX ) XXXX. I was unable to use my mouse and he controlled my computer right away. He had a white piece of paper on my screen called notepad. He asked me to type in XXXX I was unable to do it. He typed in {$4000.00}. and said that was wrong. He tabbed down and typed in {$40000.00}. and told me that I was stealing their money? I was then told that I had to go to my bank, Wells Fargo and send a wire transfer to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX # XXXX XXXX XXXX. Account number XXXX. Accout type : Savings. I was told to send {$39000.00}. as an International wire transfer to XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. If I said anything to the bank that I was being threatened they would take all of my money from my account which at the time was {$65000.00}. I did as I was told thinking that they would leave my money alone. The lady at the bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX asked me if this was a good transfer. I was afraid to say anything as I was being threatened. She thought it may be a scam and put a hold on the balance of my money left in my account. I feel that the bank could have done more for me and flagged the transfer somehow so they could make sure it was not a scam. Wells Fargo has closed this issue and told me that I would not be able to get any of my money back. I am XXXX years old and have never been threatened before. I would appreciate your help in perhaps getting my money back as it should be insured. Thank you."
1502,"This complaint is in regards to negligence on the part of Wells Fargo when {$24000.00} was fraudulently transferred from my small business account on XX/XX/2022. As I was being scammed by a fraudsters posing as the Wells Fargo Fraud department, my wife was receiving text notifications from Wells Fargo of a wire transfer recipient being set up for one of our accounts and then a a wire transfer was sent for {$24000.00}. My wife, who was at work at an elementary school, called the XXXX XXXX branch of Wells Fargo 2 minutes after the wire transfer text notification. She told the branch manger that she had received alarming texts from Wells Fargo and she read them to the branch manager. The manager told her not to worry about it and that is was probably just phishing and to monitor our accounts. She did not transfer her to the fraud department or recommend she call anyone or do anything else. She told her to delete the texts.

Once I realized that I had been scammed and the money was taken from my business account I contacted Wells Fargo immediately. They told me to come into the bank. I spoke with a banker who did not have time for me. He verified that the money was missing, but he had another appointment coming in. He also told me not to worry, the money would be replaced. I was told to go home and call the fraud department. I did not feel comfortable with this so I asked for a secure line and the banker to assist me with the call. They put me in a back room where I was interrogated by the Wells Fargo fraud department. These was no mention of a XXXX recall or any attempt to contact the bank where the funds went. In fact, it took several days for us to get any information regarding crime against me. I was made to feel that I was the criminal. On XX/XX/2022 XXXX from the fraud department called and said they made XXXX attempts to contact XXXX  XXXX XXXX but no contact had been made. Not acceptable. 

My wife and I visited the bank again XXXX XXXX as we had not received any new information on the progress of our case. We met with a branch manager and she said not to worry, our money would 100 % be replaced. She also said that they get these calls everyday and they are short staffed. No resolution.

Over the next several weeks we have placed several complaints with Wells Fargo, which have been denied. Each denial focuses on how the fraud happened and that I gave codes that authorized the wire transfer. I never denied being tricked. The complaint is how the XXXX XXXX branch of Wells Fargo reacted and advised my wife when she called in and reported the alarming notifications she received from Wells Fargo within 2 minutes of the money being wired. These notifications are what is supposed to help us stop this from happening or else what is their purpose? The bank was in the best position to stop the fraud while it was happening but they did not act in good faith and did not aid in stopping the fraud against my business. Wells Fargo simply let the scammers go and then pinned all of the blame on me. This fraud could have been stopped if Wells Fargo had proper procedures in place in the branch."
1503,"In XX/XX/XXXX I came across a gentleman by the name of XXXX XXXX of XXXX, GA who approached me and several others in a telegram group chat under the company name "" XXXX '' and said that he could get small business owners or forex  traders in that group, funding, if they needed it. I inquired more about it and asked the man what is required to go about this process, because I wanted to expand my XXXX amidst the pandemic and I thought this individual could help me. He had stated that he has helped multiple entrepreneurs get XXXX XXXX and business funding and he sent me several testimonials of his previous clients who had said that he had helped fix their credit report and changed their life drastically when he got them their business funding. I believed the testimonials. On XX/XX/2020, I yelled his girlfriend XXXX XXXX, {$500.00} through my Wells Fargo Everyday Checking Account. He then told me after confirmation of the payment that he would begin working on my credit. 3 weeks later after I initially paid the man I began to see my credit score rise. I thought that what he was doing was manifesting and happening. I then inquired him what a corp was, and he told me that it was a very expensive tool that can be purchased to enable the ability to retrieve business funding from the SBA due to the EIDL that were being handed out by the government at the time. I then XXXX XXXX  his girlfriend Mrs. XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2020 an amount of {$2500.00}, and then followed up by by wiring {$2500.00} to his XXXX XXXX  account. He provided me with the bank account routing number as well as the account number. He told me if I paid him for an "" aged corp '' which would boost my credit score up very well, that he would get me $ XXXX in business funding LEGALLY.

I tried multiple ways of trying to contact this man through telephone, through text, even through his social media XXXX tag handle XXXX XXXXXXXX, this guy blocked me. He refuses to respond to me, however from words of mouths of friends, they see him posting pictures of himself out in XXXX XXXX XXXX having fun and living life lavishly with my money spending it on margaritas, quesadillas, and expensive jewelry. I contacted my bank WELLS FARGO to inform them of what has been going on, and I filed fraud claims on all of these charges, totaling to a whopping amount of {$5500.00} USD in total. Not a single dollar was reimbursed to me. Wells Fargo went ahead and denied all of my claims and they stated that all of the payments were made through a secure device that had my name registered on it, and when the wire transfer was attempted to be retracted and retraced, his bank, XXXX XXXX, with the account under the name "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was reluctant to send the funds back. I have letters with all of these statements and results for proof. My own bank, XXXX, would not get me back my money, they stated that there is nothing they can do on their ends, and are allowing this thief, fraudster, scammer, XXXX XXXX, get away with this. I will not rest until justice is brought to this man and I will sue him in court. I want my {$5500.00} returned to me as well as be compensated for all the XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX caused by this individual. Wells Fargo held the claims open for up to 14 business days, I refiled them and pushed them for re-consideration, only to have all of them denied again. I am complaining on behalf of Wells Fargo, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, for failing to protect me as a consumer, and a customer. XXXX XXXX is a thief who scams people money just to lie to their face and use them for his own personal gain. The SBA and the FBI should HEAVILY investigate this person. XXXX XXXX.

Then, why?, I might ask, did they say in a recent letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that the reason my account was locked on XX/XX/XXXX was because I "" went over my online wire transfer limit ' which was never true because I was told I had a {$75000.00} limit and had sent {$25000.00} successfully to my wife 's account here in XXXX. 
And I followed directions ( only one per 24 hr period, {$25000.00} daily limit ) waited a few days to send the 2nd one for {$25000.00} but suddenly it was locked, not once but twice and since then ( XX/XX/XXXX ) my account has been in the "" Fraud Department '' which can only tell me "" you must return to a US branch to resolve the issue '' i.e prove my identity with a driver 's license in person before my money can be released. 

So now, since I received the "" new information ' I am being instructed to get a notarized 'Request for Closure Form '' at the XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX cost {$250.00} incl airfare etc ), express mail the original to the bank address in the XXXX and then wait for a phone call from a bank rep to set up the wire transfer of all remaining funds in my WF account ( {$39000.00} ) to my XXXX XXXX  in XXXX  XXXX

1511,"I have initiated a domestic wire transfer of {$12000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and I still don't have access to that money even today which is XX/XX/XXXX. Initiating bank is Wells Fargo. I am both sender and receiver of the wire transfer. 

I called ten times on the status and all I got for the first 4 business days is that it can take 1 to 3 business days and I have to wait until that period is complete. I asked them multiple times to tell me if there is a problem and I can verify information is needed. No knowledgeable rep answers and all they tell you is it can take 1 to 3 business days.

They let me open an investigation after completing 3 business days and still no answers. I asked them to provide wire transfer confirmation page which lists all the details including the account and routing numbers and they said they will request the appropriate department to email me the copy and I still dont have it. 

I called the recipient bank ( XXXX bank ) multiple times and they said they dont have any info of that wire with the given federal reference number and I need to talk to Wells Fargo bank who initiated the transfer. 

Its been exactly one week now and I dont have acess to my money nor I have any information. All I can do is to wait for the bank to finish the investigation which can take 10 business days. 

This is unacceptable as both are domestic banks and as a customer I need to be able to get answers. Wells Fargo charged me {$30.00} on the same day and I still dont have access to my funds."
1512,"I first engaged with the perceived investment brokers back in XXXX, where they set their trap in a XXXX comments section on a finance channel. There was a web of comments saying they had good results with them and that initially piqued my interest in trying the investments out. In this case, all the comments in that thread must have been fabricated by a pack of scammers, as these people didn't make me money or return my money when asked for it. I reached out to them on XXXX and they ensured me they were legit and experienced traders/brokers. A month goes by and I see numbers going up on the backend of their trading platform ( XXXX ) but unbeknownst to me, those numbers were static and fabricated ( looked to be a few XXXX in profits at the time ). As time goes on I feel it's enough of a return but when I asked for the profits to be sent to me ( with the condition that I pay their "" fees '' ), it became increasingly frustrating and difficult to get anything back. I was asked to purchase almost XXXX worth of crytocurrency insurance, which didn't make a lot of sense to me. I inquired why didn't they ask me to buy insurance initially and the scammer told me "" the risk is minimal starting and they can use their charts to see fluctuations '' but I smelled bs on that. Towards the end I was asked to pay upfront tax fees ( stated to be XXXX ), withdrawal fee, broker fee, and some other fee not mentioned ahead of time. I felt my XXXX and head pounding as I realized I was being taken for a spin by these professional scammers, who kept bringing up fees that nobody talked about initially. I tried to make deals with them, told them it's unethical to throw fees on people at the end of a trading process, and threatened to report them for cryptocurrency fraud. I spent weeks agonizing over lost funds ( that were my life savings and need to pay for rent/food ). What I thought was an opportunity to gain liberty was a chain of mental and financial despair. The merchants didn't help ( XXXX  and XXXX  ) as they neglected accountability for scammers using their platforms and Wells Fargo has been grossly negligent in setting up account alarms or talking to clients about "" current events '' regarding fraud, scams, and deeper investigations regarding certain transactions. Wells Fargo proved to me they don't care about their clients by issuing a single statement to me saying "" we have determined the transaction was authorized or that a processing error did not occur. Please consider your claim closed. '' That's the same as telling me "" please consider your life closed. '' Their reputation is far below the standard and events like this are why, they deserve to be blacklisted for not looking after their clients ( who've done business with them for more than a decade ). They didn't offer any deals or extended talks with the merchants to get my money back, it is unacceptable customer service."
1515,"I was scammed by a person impersonating a member of the band XXXX. They sent me very convincing material that let me to believe I had been invited to a meet and greet. I suffer from XXXX XXXX and XXXX so in light of being a relatively smart person, I took the bait. They were incredibly convincing. I had two wire money to two different accounts at Wells Fargo. I was also given a 3rd account at Wells Fargo and I also had to send money to a XXXX bank. My bank has gone to Wells Fargo to try to retrieve the wires but of course the accounts are closed. I didn't have much hope for the money being retrieved but I would like to hold Wells Fargo accountable for having multiple ( potentially hundreds, thousands ) of personal bank accounts that are only open to conduct scams and fraud. I had to wire money in the amount of {$3000.00} to a Wells Fargo account on XX/XX/XXXX to a Wells Fargo in XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX they had me send {$1300.00} to a Wells Fargo in XXXX XXXX. I have spoken to Wells Fargo. They are very pleasant but openly admit that they are aware they have multiple fraudulent account holders. How can they be aware of this and not do anything about it. My bank manager said in some cases you can just open an account on line. If there are accounts being open and closed with large wires coming into them there should clearly be a red flag that these accounts are conducting internet fraud. I was first approached on XXXX by a person with the XXXX handle XXXX his email which has an IP address in CA is XXXX. I was also sent a meet and greet invitation by "" his assistant '' her name was XXXX XXXX and her email was XXXX both of them had the IP address XXXX I was later approached by a fake XXXX singer claiming to be XXXX and he knew all about the meet and greet and couldn't wait etc. his XXXX handle XXXX email XXXX ip address XXXX. I have reported this to my own bank. They have told me that they can no longer help me. I have filed a complaint with two local police departments. The FBI, The attorney general in CA as well as the XXXX. Wells Fargo has sent me correspondence and I know that they have {$5000.00} they are a huge bank. I don't want this to happen to anyone else. This was one of the worst experiences of my entire life. If I can help just one person, I hope I can prevent this from happening for them."
1517,"My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. I bought a MONEY ORDER amounting {$3700.00} and made deposit to a Wellsfargo bank account with below information for the purchase of a car : Account number : XXXX Routing number : XXXX Account Name : XXXX XXXX WELLS FARGO After deposit was made, the money was held in the account for 7 days. On the 5th day while money was still on hold, the account holder ( XXXX XXXX ) said he got a call from the bank and they told him to come with his ID so he could get the money from his account. I told him that was fine and the money have been deposited already and I have the receipt for the Money Order and also the receipt from Wellsfargo after the deposit was made. After some hours, he told me the bank wanted to call the police on him and he managed to escape. I asked why would a bank call the police on you over a cash deposit and how did you even manage to escape arrest in a bank. 

I begin to ask him a lot of questions and I told him I wanted my money back and he said go to the bank and get your money back. I went back to the bank where I made the deposit and the lady at the bank told me there's nothing wrong with the bank account of Mr. XXXX XXXX and she also told me the amount of {$3700.00} is available right there in his account and I wonder why he wouldn't take the money out nor return back my money. 

I called Wellsfargo customer service and I was told that to get the money back, I have to do a 3 way call. Myself and XXXX XXXX will be on the phone speaking with the bank and he can instruct the bank to give me back my money. XXXX XXXX then said he got a different number on his bank information at the bank and I can tell the bank to call him since he wouldn't let me have his real telephone number. I have been trying to call XXXX XXXX ever since and I realized that he stopped using the number I have since it a roamed number. I went in the bank to let the woman know I don't have his main number and she said nothing can be done. 

These are the telephone number to reach XXXX XXXX but he won't respond to calls nor text messages : XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX  I wonder why WELLS FARGO won't call XXXX XXXX to speak with him about my claim. Its been 4 weeks already since I made the deposit and he wouldn't withdraw the money nor Wellsfargo giving it back to me. What else am I suppose to do? Can anyone help? I really want my money back."
1519,We reported it as a scam. They said they would look into and there was nothing they could do. The reported it to the other persons bank and said maybe they would do something but they never did and we never heard from them. it was a fake XXXX.
1521,"XXXX years ago, I gave the Wells Fargo Bank a sum of money from my account and obtained a cashier 's check in that amount, payable to me. The purpose of having a cashier 's check payable to me was to make a down payment on a new vehicle. For reasons not relevant to this complaint, the promised vehicle was not ready for me to acquire until yesterday ; and the required down payment turned out to be a few XXXX dollars more than the amount of the previously-obtained cashier 's check. Today I went to the same branch where I had obtained the check ( XXXX XXXX, New Jersey ), and asked the banker to issue a new check for a larger amount using funds from the previous check, plus additional cash. However, Wells Fargo Bank refused to honor its Cashier 's Check made out to me, the payee, on the ground that the check has expired and is no longer valid. 
I asked "" When did the check expire? '' The banker replied "" It expired in XXXX of XXXX. '' I asked "" Where can I read the expiration date of the check? '' The banker replied "" I don't know. '' I stated "" The check has no expiration date printed on it. The banker in this branch who issued the check to me assured me at the time of issue that the check would be negotiable during at least XXXX years. I am here within that time period. '' I showed the banker the printed Receipt for the cash that I gave to the bank four years ago, on which the bank issued the cashier 's check. The receipt bears the instructions from the banker who issued the check : "" Please use the check within 5 years. '' After showing the receipt, I told the banker "" This is my money- not the bank 's money - and I require the funds today in order to pay for my new vehicle so that I can take delivery of the vehicle. Without the funds, I will not have any vehicle at all. '' The banker conferred with someone on the telephone and then stated "" Your money has been escheated to the State. You should have received a Notice from the State. '' I replied "" I received no Notice from any State and no Notice from Wells Fargo Bank either. To which State did Wells Fargo Bank send my money? '' The banker replied "" To the State of New Jersey. '' I asked "" On what basis did this bank send my money to the State of New Jersey, considering that my accounts were opened in Florida and remain subject to Florida Rules? '' The banker replied "" I do not know. '' I said "" If the bank did in fact send my money to the State of New Jersey, that office would have sent me a written Notice. Because the State of New Jersey sent me no Notice of escheated funds, I conclude that the bank may have intended to send away the funds, but has not yet actually done so. I want you to find my money and give me the status of the Cashier 's check that I presented today, and restore my money to me. '' The banker said "" Tomorrow I will make an inquiry about the check, and then someone will call you to give you the information. '' I asked "" When will someone call me? '' The banker replied "" I don't know. Perhaps in a few days. '' I found the response vague and unsatisfactory, so I said "" That will be OK, but I need you to fill out a standard Customer Commitment Form and write down what you are going to do to assist me, and by what date it will be done. It is your bank 's policy to use that Form whenever a serious issue arises ; and depriving me of a large sum of money that belongs to me is a serious issue. '' The banker refused to fill out the standard Customer Commitment Form. 
I left the bank and called the Wells Fargo Bank XXXX XXXX Customer Service XXXX XXXX. XXXX answered. She located information about my Cashier 's Check No. XXXX. XXXX expressed surprise upon reading a notation that the funds were "" escheated to the State of New Jersey. '' At the outset, XXXX exclaimed "" A cashier 's check never expires! '' XXXX told me "" A cashier 's check issued in New Jersey is good for at least five years, and only four years have passed since the check was issued. '' I explained my basis for believing that my funds are still in the possession of Wells Fargo Bank, and not yet sent to any State government. XXXX agreed "" Your funds are probably still within Wells Fargo Bank. I can open an investigation for you, but it is better for you to go back to the branch office in person and open the investigation there. '' I told her that the banker at that branch had refused to open a formal investigation, or even to complete the standard Customer Commitment Form. XXXX conferred with her supervisor, and then reiterated her position that I should go back to the branch on XX/XX/XXXX and ask that branch to open an investigation. XXXX added that I should ask the branch manager to telephone to XXXX 's office for assistance in setting up the investigation. 
From my vantage point, the present status of my funds is LOST, MISPLACED OR STOLEN BY WELLS FARGO BANK. The bureaucratic run-around to which the bank is subjecting me guarantees that I will be deprived of my funds for the foreseeable future, in direct contravention of the purpose of issuing a Cashier 's Check - namely so that the funds are immediately available to the payee with no delays for "" clearing '' or "" reconciliation '', etc.

Here the bank has made several serious errors : 1. At the time of issue, the check had no expiration date printed on it.

2. The bank provided no written policy about expiration of a Cashier 's check.

3. The banker who issued the cashier 's check gave me misleading information about the period of validity of the cashier 's check.

4. If the bank has in fact escheated my funds to a state government, then the bank failed to first notify me of its intent to escheat my funds.

5. If the bank has in fact escheated my funds to a state government, then the bank failed to notify me of its disposition of my funds. 
6. The bank refused to follow its own written policy regarding the use of the standard Customer Commitment Form; refused to open a formal investigation of the status of my funds ; and instead addressed the issue of lost funds in an improperly casual and reckless manner.

7. The bank is ideally positioned to immediately advance funds to me ( perhaps in the form of a short-term loan ) pending resolution of my issue, so that I can consummate my vehicle purchase transaction ; yet the bank did not offer this resolution as a means of mitigating the damage caused by refusing to honor its own cashier 's check."
1524,"In XX/XX/2019 my credit was upgraded to excellent. After failing to successfully renegotiate my high interest credit card rate with Wells Fargo I opted to use a zero % interest balance transfer offer from the XXXX XXXX. I initiated this transfer on XXXX XXXX. I was instructed to make my payments on XXXX XXXX as usual to protect my payment history. The balance transfer could take up to two weeks. I made a payment to Wells Fargo onXX/XX/XXXX of {$130.00} leaving my balance at {$600.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX my XXXX XXXX was charged {$730.00} for my personal loan payoff. This resulted in an overpayment XXXX. 
When I checked my Wellsfargo account the transfer was not showing up on line, so I waited a few days. On XX/XX/XXXX I called customer service to see what the problem was. I was told the payment couldnt be found. Next I called XXXX and reconfirmed that the payment had gone through and then called Wells Fargo back. They found the payment and I was told I would receive a check for the overpayment in 7-10 days. 
Later that night I checked my account on line and discovered that all of the records of my personal loan had been deleted from my online banking link. I had no account number and no payment history. The only way to show the overpayment was through my other bank records. I visited my local branch on XX/XX/XXXX to sort it out. A bank associate contacted the loan department and again told me I would receive a check in 7-10 days. As a XXXX veteran on a fixed income I was counting on the refund showing up on time as its late arrival would effect my quality of life. 
On XXXX XXXX I again visited my local Wells Fargo branch, to find out where my check was. The representative again contacted the loan department who could not give me any information as to when the check was mailed. I found it very suspicious that a XXXX dollar bank with state of the art computer technology couldn't keep track of their mail. At this time I informed Wells Fargo of my intent to file a complaint with the Consumer financial protection bureau. I was also told at this time that the wait time was actually 7-10 business days and I should wait a couple more days. 
On XX/XX/XXXX having still not received the much needed refund check I again visited a local Wells Fargo branch. The associate contacted the loan department for the third time. At this time was told for the fourth time that the check was in the mail. Miraculously at this time the loan department was now able to provide mailing information. Is this because I threatened to file a complaint? 
Given Wells Fargos history of greed and corrupt behavior I suspect this was yet another shameless attempt by the banking industry to fleece consumers. The minute my personal loan was overpaid a check should have been generated by a computer and mailed immediately. Not only was this refund not issued in a timely fashion its seems that there was an attempt to abscond the refund. At no time did my account show the over payment or was I notified of such. Deleting my account and payment history so quickly and with out notification was suspicious. It left me without pertinent personal payment records. In closing I would like to say that as a XXXX XXXX If I knew what my government let the Banking Industry an other big businesses get away with I wouldnt have served."
1525,"Money was transferred through Wells Fargo on a XXXX account. A complaint was filed with Wells Fargo informing the person never sent the purse. A request was made to Wells Fargo to return the money and Wells Fargo said no. Wells Fargo should not be doing business with XXXX. Wells Fargo needs to note this on their Web-site and try to do more to help people from being scammed. 

Wells Fargo was on the news last year for fraudulent bank accounts which sounds like Wells Fargo doesn't have a problem taking money from people. And now Wells Fargo will not return my money. 

Date of Transaction : XX/XX/2019 XXXX # XXXX XXXX {$400.00} XXXX # XXXX."
1528,there was a unauthorized deposit made to my account of {$2200.00} on XX/XX/2019 there were 5 checks deposited to my account for a company that i do not know. i am making a complaint because this is not the first time wells fargo does this the erases any transactions of deposits or withdrawals like it never happened. i wanted the money removed from my account but wells fargo denied the request.
1529,"On XX/XX/2022 I sent an international wire transfer of {$9900.00} USD from XXXX to my Wells Fargo account in America. The first 3 digits of the account number were missing in the initial transmission so the funds ( {$9800.00} ) inadvertently went into another Wells Fargo customers account, even though the name and account number did not match. On XX/XX/2022, my remittance bank ( XXXX ) submitted an amendment to correct the account number. And then on XX/XX/2022, the remittance bank submitted a recall of the funds. 

I went to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2022 and a complaint was submitted through banker A. Banker A said she can not directly call the customer who had my funds, but her bank manager could. I went to Wells Fargo 2-3 days later, either on XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX, 2022 and was told by the bank manager he can not take any action or do anything to assist me. The same day I visited the bank manager, the incorrect recipient transferred the funds into another account. I suspect communication took place between the bank manager and the incorrect recipient without any follow-up or without my knowledge. The funds were untouched for over a month until I visited the branch manager. I visited another Wells Fargo Branch location on XX/XX/XXXX, where Banker C followed up on the recall. However, since the recall was submitted on XX/XX/2022, Wells Fargo has made the required amount of attempts to the incorrect recipient and closed my case."
1531,I got sent a message through my school email about a job position. I followed what they told me and unfortunate sent some money after I realized it was fraud.
1532,"On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, went into your branch XXXX XXXXXXXX to initiate a wire transfer for {$1200.00}. When XXXX XXXX arrived at the bank, all the employees were with other customers, so XXXX XXXX waited patiently. The manager of this branch, XXXX XXXX, came out from behind a closed door and offered to help, but when he found out what XXXX XXXX needed, he stated that he doesn't do wires that often, but that he would help him. XXXX XXXX stated that he didn't mind waiting for another employee to become available, but XXXX XXXX insisted. XXXX XXXX asked XXXX XXXX how much he wanted to send, XXXX XXXX stated {$1200.00}. XXXX XXXX, also repeated the amount of {$1200.00}, but then stated that he needed to get someone to approve the wire transfer. Once the person approved the transfer, XXXX XXXX asked XXXX XXXX to verify that the account number for the receiving party was correct. They then completed the transaction and XXXX XXXX handed the receipt to XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX NEVER asked XXXX XXXX to verify the amount. After XXXX XXXX returned home for the evening, he handed the Wire Transfer receipt to his spouse, that's when they both noticed that {$12000.00} was sent!!!! Not {$1200.00}. 

The following day, XXXX XXXX and his spouse went to the branch to talk to XXXX XXXX and get this wire fixed and the correct amount sent. XXXX XXXX stated in front of XXXX XXXX, his spouse, and XXXX XXXX, that he sent $ XXXX. XXXX and I then showed XXXX XXXX the wire transfer receipt. When XXXX XXXX looked at the receipt and all he said was "" No I sent {$1200.00} just like you said '' and once he realized the amount XXXX XXXX then stated "" that's my bad '' and then ran off behind the door, a closed door that XXXX XXXX and I observed other employees exit and enter the bank 's main floor. XXXX XXXX then contacted your wire department to see if the wire can be recalled. Here is the reference # XXXX XXXX gave us XXXX. XXXX was also given a complaint ID # XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX and I were told that it could be anywhere from 1 to 6 weeks to get this resolved.XXXX  XXXX tried calling customer service to get updates, but was told that we needed to go to the bank to get an update. 

After returning to the bank the following Monday, XXXX XXXX and his spouse were told that the receiving bank ( XXXX XXXX ) where the wire was sent, acknowledged the recall, but that they needed to do their own investigation. In the meantime, XXXX XXXX reached out to the receiving party, and they acknowledged that too much was sent, and that they were gon na send the overpayment back, but has since stopped all communication with XXXX XXXX. 

We were just told on Thursday that XXXX XXXX  declined the recall, this is why I am reaching out to you to get this matter resolved as soon as possible. XXXX XXXX was told that XXXX has been assigned this case # XXXX and can be reached at XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX can be reached at XXXX and is eagerly waiting for your call. 

Thanks"
1534,"This was around XXXX. I was told by Wells Fargo. That XXXX or so was deposited in my account I didn't know about. I was told they took back the check. I emailed that my account had a negative balance. When I called to ask about it then told all about the money being deposited. Which I then disputed everything because I didn't know about it. I was told by Wells Fargo according to them I did deposit they money. I was out and owed them the money back. After at least 5 or so complaints to them, nothing they could do. Even after I did a fraud application and everything."
1535,"OnXX/XX/2018 I used Wells Fargo backed XXXX  to make a money transfer to my brother in the amount of {$500.00}. XXXX accessed my contact list to locate my brothers number to start the transfer. The number comes directly from my phone so it wasnt an error with miss-typing the number or anything like that. My brother told me he never received the money. He contacted XXXX, they said they can not do anything and told him to contact his bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). He called XXXX and they said there are no records of money deposited. I contacted XXXX who told me to contact my bank. I called Wells Fargo and they said that they cant do anything. I reached out to them numerous times via online and all they did was post a link to XXXX website. I asked them which institution received that deposit if my brother never received it, they canot provide an answer. I contacted XXXX  again via messaging and I got an automatic reply stating that they will answer in 2 business days ... still I havent heard anything. No one can trace the funds even though my brothers number was correctly entered. The two institutions redirect me to one another. Im not sure what else to do but hope that this has been reported so that people are aware that this is going on."
1537,"On XX/XX/XXXX at about XXXX PST, we attempted to buy concert tickets in the amount of {$100.00} through a XXXX party vendor. The payment was made via XXXX, which is used to transfer money between XXXX parties. This mode of transfer is accepted through the major financial institutions which will usually protect their consumers from theft/fraud. We asked the seller of the tickets for proof that the tickets were real and they sent us an image verifying their authenticity but required payment prior to sending the tickets. We sent the payment, assuming that the bank would provide us some sort of protection if something occurred. Unfortunately, the tickets were not sent and the seller would not answer any attempts of communication. We then called Wells Fargo to see if they would reverse the transaction but they said that since we authorized the transaction that it could not be cancelled or reversed. We feel that XXXX is very misleading because it does not advertise that it should only be used with friends and family and yet it is being supported by the major banking institutions that give you a false sense of security."
1539,"On XX/XX/XXXX I issued a wire transfer in the amount of {$50000.00} from my XXXX  XXXX XXXX account to my supplier 's account at Wells Fargo bank. The same day XXXX issued a reversal order because I realized I had issued the transfer to the wrong account. 

My supplier was only notified of the reversal 17 days later. They agreed to the reversal immediately and now, 45 days later the reversal has still not taken place. And there has been zero written communication from either bank. 
We have filed a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX and now we are filing one against Wells Fargo"
1540,I was scammed by a impersonated Wells Fargo employee on XX/XX/2022 for XXXX XXXX  Wells Fargo claim # XXXX
1541,"My brother who is XXXX tried to send me a check for XXXX Wells Fargo deemed fraudulent, they said to have him send another check which he did, I went into the Wells fargo branch opend a new account deposited the money, the bank XXXX approved the check. We are dealing Wells fargo to Wells Fargo, we both have the same last name and my name is on XXXX of his other accounts. Again they said it was forgery, then in speaking to Wells Fargo I explained my brother is in the hospital can not walk and wont be released anytime soon. They advise for him to do a wire transfer since he can. He did that on XX/XX/XXXX. Next thing i know my accounts are frozen. for Fraud. I call the fraud number, explained it isnt fraud, she said can your brother call. I said yes. My brother who by the way is in another state, calls the bank they verify and he confirms he wants the transfer of XXXX to be sent to me. They said they didn't believe him, even though they sent a pin code, and asked his social, birth date etc. He gave them all my info as well. They said he needs to go to the bank,. he explained he is in the hospital and can not walk and if he could go to the bank he wouldn't need to do this. He then tells them just leave the money in his account and release my accounts and they wont do that. I call back and they refuse to help me and still consider this fraud. We follow their instructions and do exactly what they said and get everything verified. Even the person on the phone said all of the information is verified, but whomever is making a decision that is affecting my brother who needs help now to have someone pay his bills and my access to my banking. They are ruining our lives for no reason and causing all of this XXXX and locking up my accounts is absurd. I have been a customer for over 20 years as my brother has been. I need someone to help. No XXXX will."
1544,"Wells Fargo claims International Wire Transfers can't be refunded. I was scammed into making 3 installments using my savings account money, then monies unknown to me at the time, which were transferred from other accounts I had access to under my name but were my mother 's. My brother and I had rights to overseeing her checking and savings. 
No red flags signaled the banker to stop the transactions or question me further. They assumed I transferred monies in large amounts without even a warning, or if this was legit. 
The first date was XX/XX/2022, ( {$19000.00} ) then XX/XX/XXXX ( {$38000.00} ) then XXXX installment was done on XX/XX/XXXX ( {$19000.00} ). 
Along with these scams were others involving XXXX money cards and XXXX gift cards. The whole scam period continued for 10 days, with a confession from one of the scammers on the 11th day. They impersonated a Wells Fargo Fraud agent and a FTC Commissioner. I have made a police report and one with the FTC."
1546,"Wells Fargo Bank closed my accounts on XXXX XXXX 2022. I received the notification letter saying that money ( XXXX USD ) was transferred to my Bank accounts in XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) on XXXX XXXX 2022 ( transaction confirmation : XXXX ).

1549,"On XX/XX/18, I used the banking service XXXX to purchase {$470.00} worth of products from another individual. I determined the purchase to be fraudulent following several attempts to collect the product, one attempt being to request the product again as a different person. When the individual connected with me as a different person and tried to sell the product to me, I knew that I'd been scammed. I immediately contacted my bank - Wells Fargo, to stop the purchase or dispute the transaction. After being bounced around by two local branch bankers and three times through the customer service line, I was told that the  transfer had already taken place, and there was nothing at all that they could do for me."
1551,"Wells Fargo "" Pay Bills '' process delay in sending payments to payees. 
. 
When Wells Fargo customers select a "" send date '' to pay bills from their checking accounts using the Wells Fargo online banking, the payments take anywhere from 1 to 5 days from the "" send date '' to the "" deliver date, depending on the payee, to reach the payee. The money is taken form the customers account on the "" send date ''.

Therefore the customer has to take that date lag into account and schedule the payments at least 1 to 5 days before the payments is due to the payee. Any miscalculation on the part of the customer could result in late payments to the payee, and late fees from the payee and possible lowering of their credit score.

In the 21st century, why does it take Wells Fargo anywhere from 1 to 5 days to send an electronic payment to a payee? Other banks can send the payments right away to payees. Consumers can send money instantly from their checking account to another person using XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and the like. 

Is Wells Fargo using the payment dollar amounts as a interest free loan during the "" send date '' and "" deliver date '' 1 to 5 days interval. When you add up the thousands of payments Wells Fargo processes daily, they would add up to millions of dollars in Wells Fargo possession until the payments are delivered."
1553,"Good afternoon, my name is XXXX XXXX I have been banking with wells Fargo for about XXXX years. About XX/XX/2020 I wired money to have my car fixed to XXXX XXXX ( {$1000.00} ).

I was required to visit branch to unlock my account. All of my money ( {$6000.00} ) had been snatched from my account. A false check was also deposited into a atm with my name misspelled & different signature. My account is now over drawn by {$1000.00}, I never received this debit card that was used for the transaction. My Wells Fargo banking is only conducted in the city of XXXX GA.

I filled a notorized complaint XX/XX/2015 and sent to Wells Fargo Bank the missing check numbers and amounts were furnished to me by the State of Florida Disbursement Unit. I sent the paperwork to Wells Fargo Treasury Management Fraud operations XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX South Carolina XXXX. I called Wells Fargo numerous times and I was told that I had to get a case number from the State of Florida Dispursement Unit. When I called them they didn't know what I was talking about. So far I have not got anywhere with these 2 agencies. I have the check numbers and amount that were cashed. I really cant understand why no one can help me. I am filing this complaint in hopes of getting a resolution.
1557,I am not satisfied with the resolution to my dispute. I am a new and young customer with Wells Fargo. I do not think they should deal with XXXX for many reasons. It is not a reputable company and there is no fraud protection at all. I understand that you should never send money to someone you don't know but I believe as big as Wells Fargo is and as long as they have been around that they would be able to protect their customers. I did use XXXX and thought the transaction went through however Wells Fargo posted this transaction twice. I am very dissatisfied with the results of my first complaint and I believe that the resolution was honestly a bit juvenile. I had already gotten my refund from Overdraft when I myself called the bank. I believe I deserve to be refunded one charge of the {$70.00} transfer to XXXX. I do NOT think that is asking much. I have learned my lesson and will never use this function again but I believe that Wells Fargo should have some protection for their customers.

After sending the payment, the seller said that I needed to buy a thermal crate ( between {$900.00} and {$1600.00} ) to have the puppy shipped in since the regular crate wasnt sufficient for the weather and the size of the puppy. I started asking questions and realized that this wasnt as advertised. I didnt send any more money but then asked the seller to refund my {$500.00} payment as I told him that I couldnt afford to buy a different crate.

I filed a complaint to my bank ( Wells Fargo ) that same day stating to them very clearly that I did not authorize that transfer. They gave me a case number : XXXX. In that timeframe between me making a claim and them investigating, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX that the account that they had of 'me ' was closed. They let me know that the investigation would take at least 10 days. On XX/XX/2021 I called Wells Fargo to get an update and they stated that they were still under investigation. The next day, I received a letter from Wells Fargo indicating that the claim and the entire case were denied. They decided that I authorized that transaction myself. On XX/XX/2021 I visited a Wells Fargo branch in XXXX XXXX FL to what they told me was that they could not do anything and redirect me to XXXX XXXX to "" hopefully receive my funds that were rightfully mine ''. I then showed up at XXXX XXXX that same day with my proper identification with the letter of 'my account closing ' and talked to a customer service associate. He told me since my account with them closed that my funds were transferred back to my account with Wells Fargo. I showed him the evidence that I had not received any transfer by showing my bank statements on my phone. He then concluded that he would contact the I.T Fraud Team to resolve and return my funds. As of today, I still don't have my funds returned. I have contacted Wells Fargo for the third time now to raise my claim as well as ask them for the IP Address and the device I supposedly transferred the funds on. They replied that they would contact me back in 48 hours which has not happened yet."
1572,"XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX menulis : Dear sir, Base on Support XXXX Ref : XXXX i need legal aid from advocacy. 

I just want to know how to access funds that will be sent to me, from the XXXX people who played a role in requesting payment from me on behalf of a claim based on the name of the Wells Fargo Bank company, regarding international remittances to me, through proof of receipts and receipts that I have received. and on behalf of my own account as beneficiary funds. 

the XXXX individuals have had their respective roles in the order to request payment from me using the name wells fargo : 1. the sender named XXXX XXXX XXXX based on the bank receipt i received i will receive the transfer XXXX {$2.00} claiming to be XXXX requesting crypto payments from me ( someone claiming to be from XXXX is asking for crypto payments that I've transferred for international remittance payments ) 3. the head of the international wells fargo bank fund transfer center XXXX who acts as an employee of wells fargo bank with the nametaxt employment of wells fargo bank , as director of the bank named XXXX XXXX XXXX.

they are the XXXX unbroken link in the wells fargo bank that has switched roles to contact me. 

Even though in your investigation, they are not part of you, but they do have the official wells fargo bank receipt that I have received. and lastly the ball is in the third person, namely XXXX and XXXX. 

I don't know how you found access to my remittances working in law enforcement within the United Federal State government? 

So you can immediately decide for yourself without me involving wells fargo customers to lead to law enforcement police offices or law enforcement offices. if it's true they're definitely all involved in a fraud syndicate, froud, international code of ethics. because I don't really know and don't know about the laws that apply to all federal states. On behalf of Wells Fargo Bank I need your help, to resolve this case to a transparent law enforcement and sense of justice. 

What is certain is that a customer only needs the funds that have been issued for payments that have been transferred to all of them, to be able to return to my bitcoin account or address, which I can use to pay my XXXX XXXX credit card monthly bills in XXXX as my loan for crypto purchases in my wallet. For the payment to them.

I called my bank, Wells Fargo, and notified them of this, and questioned whether or not I should be concerned. The banker advised the check was going through, and no concerns they can think of. On XX/XX/2022, the funds were in my account, and XXXX advised to send the first payment via XXXX. I did this, and then they requested more payments be sent. With this, more and more issues came about and the payments wouldnt complete, but XXXX rushed me to get the funds sent and suggested a wire transfer. i spoke with the bank again and advised what was happening and still did not get any additional direction. I sent the wire but advised the company it was under duress and was very skeptical. After the wire transfer completed, XXXX sent me another check stating I need to order more funds. I pushed back as much as possible, but ultimately ended up depositing the second check, but advised funds would not be sent without more information. I called the bank directly after and was told that this was indeed a scam, and that unfortunately I will be responsible for the funds sent. I dont understand how this is a case, and now I am negative over {$2000.00} in my account. I would simply ask to be ace whole as I made every attempt to discuss with the bank during this process to avoid any negative repercussions on myself.

They had over XXXX pictures and a video listed for this ( and other tractors ). After negotiating and communicating about the tractor I agreed to purchase the tractor ( via signed contract ) and sent payment via wire transfer from my savings account. When the tractor was never delivered and I was unable to get in contact with the seller I filed a fraud claim with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX, which was the day the tractor was supposed to be delivered. On XX/XX/XXXX without any attempt to figure out what actually happened, I received a letter in the mail saying they would not reimburse me and that my claim was closed. Wells Fargo never asked any follow up information and to the best of my knowledge their only attempt at getting the money back was by asking for the wire to be recalled. When I called and asked why it was unable to be reimbursed they simply said because I authorized the transaction. I was deceived by a seller who scammed me out of {$15000.00}."

Despite having an authorized XXXX account through XXXX XXXX XXXX, and despite the fact that Wells Fargos XXXX app verified that the name of the account I was sending the money to was in fact XXXX XXXX, both the banks and XXXX have shown very little intiative or interest in solving this issue. This is a clear case of fraud linked to a traceable account. Furthermore, I spent nearly 2 hours talking to multiple Wells Fargo agents who took my information down, put me on hold, and then disappeared for substantial amounts of time before the phone transferred to a new agent. The final agent filed a claim with zero interest in the details of my situation and would only take the basic information. I am very disappointed with Wells Fargos response to this issue. I was frauded on a service that they endorse and promote and make easily accessible to all customers as the most effective way to send money. The fact that they hold zero accountabiltiy for such a service and are unwilling to provide any assistance to long-standing customers in the aftermath of a brazen incident of fraud is disheartening to say the least. This circumstance showed zero concern on Wells Fargos end in regards to working to secure my trust and money and I can not in faith continue with their services unless so measure of concern and interest is shown to the situation."

In XX/XX/2018 I discovered that a significant sum of money, approximately {$7000.00}, was taken out of my XXXX  XXXX XXXX checking account without my authorization. Upon this discovery, I submitted a fraud claim with XXXX  XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX provided me a {$7000.00} credit while they performed their investigation. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating that because my username and password had been used for the transactions, they considered that an authorized transaction, denied my fraud claim and reversed the {$7000.00} credit from my account. No money was put into my account based on my claim and I subsequently closed that bank account with XXXX  XXXX XXXX. 

After receiving the fraud claim denial from XXXX XXXX XXXX, Ms. XXXX contacted me because {$2600.00} from her savings account and {$200.00} from her checking account had been taken from her Wells Fargo account stating that it was a partial reversal of unauthorized transfers. It was only at this time that I knew where the money gone ( Ms. XXXX bank account ) when it was taken out of my account without my consent. It was at this time that I discovered that XXXX XXXX, Ms. XXXX daughter and my ex-girlfriend, had taken the money out of my account under the pretext that it was to pay bills relating to the apartment XXXX and I were living together prior to the breakup. Ms. XXXX informed me that she was not aware of the fact that XXXX and I had broken up and that she was only involved in the situation thinking that the money was to pay bills. 

Because XXXX XXXX XXXX had denied my fraud claim and because I believe that Ms. XXXX did not know that the money had been taken out of my account without my permission, I agreed to help Ms. XXXX retrieve the money that had been taken out of her account as a partial reversal of unauthorized transfers. 

During the process, Ms. XXXX and I spent an absorbent amount of time on the phone with both XXXX  XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo on numerous occasions in a failed attempt to retrieve Ms. XXXX funds. This included having to take time off work to make calls and to visit the banks in person.

Ms. XXXX has kept prodigious notes which I have reviewed and I defer to Ms. XXXX notes for additional detail regarding specific dates and times we met with both banks. 

For any additional information, please feel free to contact me at XXXX.

To date, Wells Fargo has no policy that holds them accountable to their customer for taking a suspected counterfeit bill. 

We received an XX/XX/XXXX letter from Wells Fargo that explained there lack of accountability for our bill. They placed the blame on the U.S. Secret Service. This explanation is unacceptable. We have way of knowing nor proof that the bill was even given to the Secret Service. When Wells Fargo took our bill they assumed the responsibility to properly account for that bill, and to communicate and proof to us that it was in fact counterfeit. Because of Wells Fargo 's lack of accountability we have no idea what happened to that bill."
1621,"I paid {$50.00} via XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, did not receive the promised item, then immediately called my bank ( WF ) to stop the transfer ( it didnt go through until days later on XX/XX/XXXX ). The bank told me they could not stop the payment, but would credit me the {$50.00}, but then I never received it. I then spoke to 8 different Wells Fargo agents over the next 2 weeks over many hours who were all giving me inconsistent information and false promises. Then I got a letter stating my claim has been closed."
1622,"I had been looking for a new laptop because of school, and since I didnt have enough to buy a new laptop I went online to look for a used one. In the ending of XXXX I came across a XXXX XXXX. This seller told me that they got two from a scholarship and that they could sell me one, so I asked if I could negotiate the price. Eventually, I got the price to {$300.00}. This may not seem like a lot but for me it is! He/She told me too use XXXX. I thought okay this is backed up by my bank, so Ill be safe even if something happens. I made the transaction and then the scammer says that they are on their way to ship my laptop out. Ive been waiting weeks and I have NOTHING! The scammer blocked my number and I found out that it was a fake number too! So my question is, if this is so safe then why is it so easy to make an account? There should be protection just Incase anything goes wrong. I understand this couldve been avoided if I wasnt being so cheap, but what can I do now? I have no money, I tried calling my bank they left me on hold for hours. I was told to make a police report, seriously so Wells Fargo cant help with anything??? I am very upset because I thought Wells Fargo would have my back with something like this but I guess not."
1623,"On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX PM ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I received a text asking if I attempted to make a Zelle transfer for {$2000.00} "" Reply YES or NO '' I replied "" NO '' from there I received a text back saying "" Thank you for your confirmation, case id # XXXX '' Then, I received a call at XXXX PM from a Wells Fargo number from a man claiming to be a representative for Wells Fargo stating that he was going to help me undo the money that had been fraudulently sent out of my XXXX. The representative had me verify my phone number and address so a new debit card could be issued and sent to my house. I logged into my Wells Fargo account. The representative had me add myself to my XXXX and XXXX myself {$1000.00}, then another {$1000.00}, then {$1400.00}. When I said the text only stated {$2000.00} was taken, he reassured me that since the text had been sent, the scammers had taken another {$1400.00} out of my account. The representative told me I was undoing the transactions that the scammers had just done. Once the money was sent, he hung up and I drove straight to my local Wells Fargo bank to get some help. There, they created 3 fraud claims for me, one for each of the transactions made. They told me that the number that called me was in fact a Wells Fargo number and they aren't sure how someone called me from it. I was also told that by making those XXXX transactions, I had actually been sending the money to a fraudulent bank account XXXX XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo had decided to not reimburse me my money because they could not find the fraud on my account. I am sharing this for others to see and to fight Wells Fargo, XXXX XXXX  and XXXX to get my {$3400.00} back. I have reason to believe that one of Wells Fargos own employees was the fraud on the other end of the phone. If it wasn't an Employee, Wells Fargo has scammers breaching their phone lines and hacking their phone systems which needs to be investigated."
1626,"On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo received a written request to close and wire transfer all the money that was is in a XXXX account. Ive called their Exception Payments Account Closures Department several times and always on hold from 2 hours 30 minutes to 7 hours on hold and can never get a person on the line. Once XXXX XXXX  pst came all the lines are disconnected so I filled a complaint with their business executive officer on XX/XX/XXXX but no one can ever give me a direct answer to when those funds will be transferred. 
After numerous calls and being misdirected I was finally got an email from XXXX XXXX whos title is Executive Office Case Specialist and was given a case number # XXXX and was told that they would investigate the delay. After a few days I was told that the Exception Payments Account Closures Department was running 60 days behind schedule. This is outrageous and unacceptable, but it wasnt till XX/XX/XXXX that I received a call from Wells Fargo Exception Payments Account Closures Department and reconfirmed all that necessary information to have the wire transfer done that day and was given a confirmation number with a date of expectation of money being deposited on XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I again called Wells Fargo and was given the run around with no straight answers of where this money was or if there were any problems. The only thing I was offered was wait till without looking into this problem was that it takes 10 business day which would be XX/XX/XXXX. Being rushed off the phone I felt there was nothing else I could do. 
Today XX/XX/XXXX Money still hasnt been deposited and just to make sure We called the receiving bank to make sure there was no problems on our end. I contacted XXXX XXXX from Wells Fargo again and was directed to the wire transfer department. I called that department but was told that they couldnt help me because my account was closed and I would have to speak with Exception Payments Account Closures Department and I asked to speak with a manager and was blindly transferred to Line of Business Executive office I Talked to other agent there and was told that XXXX XXXX would be calling me back within the hour because she was in a meeting. I need to know where this money is at and when will I be receiving it. I had open escrow on a property and was suppose to close this deal on XX/XX/XXXX, one day after the original day and since I was not able to close the deal Im out {$5000.00} already."

On XX/XX/2021 I was called into my attorneys office to review the wiring instructions and after reviewing said instructions it was brought to my attention that the wire instructions were fraudulent. We immediately noticed XXXX bank and XXXX XXXX and reported the scam. Several days later XXXX Bank informed me that my money was being held in a frozen account in Wells Fargo and that the scammer never got a single XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX and XXXX bank have been working tirelessly trying to recall my money, to no avail.

He proceeded to book the flight but it did not go through due to a payment issue on his account. I notified him and he said hes try again. 3 days later I got fed up with reminding him to buy my plane ticket again.

Wells Fargo was responsible for telling me the funds were good. They did. Then took the money from me and closed my accounts. 
I think the Bank should be responsible the money and not me. 
I understood the funds would be bank wire with money supporting the deposits. I had no idea who the deposits cam from. I could not see with my app. I had to go to my branch to get copies. Which was days later and after writing the trust."
1638,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an online wire transfer but it never arrived to the beneficiary. On XX/XX/XXXX, I started an investigation and until today, Wells Fargo has not been able to refund the money. They refused to do a fraud claim and all they tell me is to file a complain. I have filed 3 complains and so far, they still tell me I have to wait. I have requested several times something in writing about the situation but the bank refuses to do so."
1641,"on XX/XX/10 I was scammed by an individual using XXXX through Wells Fargo. After fake emails/texts that were manipulated, we transferred {$300.00} to the scammer in order to complete the transactions ( which we were supposed to received {$300.00} ). Once I realized it was a scam and the money had been sent, I immediately tried to call XXXX to cancel the transaction but they said I had to go through Wells Fargo. So I immediately called WF and as explained the situation, of which they opened a claim. Keep in mind I still had the person on a text conversation and if someone would have looked into the email and phone number at that moment, at least this scammer could have been caught/flagged/punished. Instead since it was a verified transaction Wells Fargo won't do anything and XXXX wipes their hands free of these issues. So no insurance or protection for consumers.

after numerous excuses from seller as to why I could not come for puppy, I felt uneasy and felt as though I was getting scammed. 
XX/XX/2018- I called my bank to inform them I believed I was getting scammed and to please cancel the transaction, although the bank said it was too late and that I needed to contact XXXX XXXX because there was nothing my bank could do for me. I then proceeded to contact XXXX, with no turn of luck. They too could not do anything for me. 
Finally after confronting seller that I felt uneasy about her, she offered to return my deposit back to me on XX/XX/2018. That day went by and still no money was returned. When I asked about it, she told me that it would be sent around XXXX that evening.

1647,"On XX/XX/2022, I received an email from what looked like to be my mortgage officer about the closing of my house. The email had my officers email address, name, email format of the mortage company, my closing costs ( {$29000.00} ), and address of my house. I followed the instructions of this and made the payment cost for the closing of my house. 

On XX/XX/2022, my Mortage officer had called me and told me how I planned to send the money for my closing ( Keep in mind that the builder and mortage company did not tell me the exact closing date of my house yet, only the general time ). I was surprised because I thought I sent it, but apparently there has been a hacking and sending of fradulent emails within the company the past. The hackers had intercepted the emails of the closing ( included closing cost, address, etc ), and impersonated the people I was in contact with. They misled me into sending a fraudulent wire transfer through this, as almost everything seemed OK and only a few people had this information. This fradulent bank account was a wells fargo account. 

This has been going on since XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, and they failed to inform me of this until XX/XX/XXXX, when I was too late to stop the wire obviously. 

I still filed this to XXXX ( my bank ), to recall the funds from wells fargo account ( fradulent bank account ). I also went to multiple Wells Fargo location, and managed to create a compliant to them to investigate this account, but they failed to freeze it and far as I know this account is still active. 

I believe that dozens ( maybe 100s ) of fake wells fargo accounts were opened up during this time period, and the closing/housing information of 100s of people who worked with XXXX XXXX were stolen by these hackers. My mortage officer and branch manager mentioned that several people, including myself, fell for this scam too. So many were affected."

I have called Wells Fargo at least XXXX times over the last XXXX weeks and I have visited my local branch twice to get help.

1652,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I went into Wells Fargo Bank branch # XXXX to initiate a wire transfer for {$1200.00} I arrived at the bank, all the employees were with other customers, so I waited patiently. The manager of this branch came out from behind a closed door and offered to help, but when he found out what I needed, he stated that he doesn't do wires that often, but that he would help me. I stated that I didn't mind waiting for another employee to become available, but he insisted. The manager asked me how much I wanted to send, I stated {$1200.00}. The manager repeated the amount of {$1200.00}, but then stated that he needed to get someone to approve the wire transfer. Once the person approved the transfer, The manager asked me to verify that the account number for the receiving party was correct. He then completed the transaction and the manager handed the receipt to me. The manager NEVER asked me to verify the amount. After I returned home for the evening, handed my fianc the Wire Transfer receipt, that's when she noticed that {$12000.00} was sent!!!! Not {$1200.00}. 

The following day, my fianc and i went to the branch to talk to the manager and get this wire fixed and the correct amount sent. The manager stated in front my fianc, another bank employee and me, that he sent $ XXXXMy fianc then showed the manager the wire transfer receipt. When the manager looked at the receipt and all he said was "" No I sent {$1200.00} just like you said '' and once he realized the amount the manager then stated "" that's my bad!! I assumed when you said this was for a loan closing, this was for a house '' and then ran off behind the door, a closed door that my fiance and I observed other employees exit and enter the bank 's main floor. The other bank employee then contacted their wire department to see if the wire can be recalled. My fiance and I was told that it could be anywhere from 1 to 6 weeks to get this resolved. I tried calling customer service to get updates, but was told that we needed to go to the bank to get an update. 

After returning to the bank the following Monday, My fiance and I were told that the receiving bank ( XXXX XXXX  ) where the wire was sent, acknowledged the recall, but that they needed to do their own investigation. In the meantime, I reached out to the receiving party, and they acknowledged that too much was sent, and that they were gon na send the overpayment back, but has since stopped all communication with me We were just told on Thursday that the receiving Bank declined the recall, this is why I am reaching out to you to get this matter resolved as soon as possible."
1653,"On Monday, XX/XX/22 at XXXX XXXX  a person had left my wife a message claiming they were with our local law enforcement, Warrant and Claims department and stating they were going to detain my wife for missing jury duty. They claimed she had gotten a certified letter in XXXX that she signed for, stating jury duty was upcoming. My wife call them back, claiming to be XXXX XXXX with the XXXX, MN police department. He had asked to transfer money over the phone otherwise my wife would be detained for paying as she had a warrant out for her arrest. Unknown to me, she was in the other room of our house dealing with this person, transferred from our Wells Fargo Bank account through XXXX, {$1000.00}. After 20 minutes of dealing with this person, she had me talk to them as they wanted to transfer money from XXXX next in the amount of {$1500.00} and trying to get a total of {$3500.00}. I talked to the person "" XXXX XXXX '' and called his bluff, unknown to me she had already transferred the {$1000.00} through XXXX. I stated if he is a police officer how can he prove it... he said he would hang up and call from the main number at the police station. He called back 30 seconds later and phone number came up with the XXXX Police department. I actually started to believe him somewhat, but told him still not good enough. 
He was going to have my wife stay on the phone, record her mileage on our vehicle and drive to the XXXX, MN police station. He stated she could not go anywhere else, to stay on the phone and drive directly to the XXXX Police Station and she was about to. I told him, the police could come to our house and arrest her if this was true and told her to hang up, in which she did. 
I started a claim with our bank, Wells Fargo and filed a police report. Wells Fargo stated today, XX/XX/22 that the claim has been closed, they reached out to the other bank and was unlikely to get our money back. 
This is very upsetting that someone would push this hard and take money from hard working individuals and keep going on to the next person and do the same thing. There has to be protection out there for this. We have banked with Wells Fargo for 30 some years, have excellent credit and no records, even as far as a speeding ticket."
1654,"Original Transfer Amount : {$2500.00} Date : XX/XX/XXXX WF XXXX ( XXXX ) WF XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ) This is my second complaint opened for the same issue ( XXXX ), I would like to include more details this go about. Currently my claim status is closed and the bank is "" awaiting recovery '' of the funds from the external bank. At this point there are two problem that I would like to address, firstly I have not received communication as to what went wrong with the original transfer, the bank is saying it is completed yet they can not get in touch with the receiving bank to verify this. Secondly I sent a successful wire through a branch using the same information I typed online and it was successful. It is my assumption that Wells Fargo somehow sent the instructions incorrectly to the receiving bank and because of this the receiving bank ( XXXX ) either did not deposit the funds to the correct account or they deposited into their bank general ledger. I think this because at no point have I been informed of an error made by myself. If the bank is responsible for the error than they should write off the transfer as a loss and credit the funds back to my account. Also I am not sure how they can assume it was completed if they can not even verify it with the external bank. I was told when I called in that their wire operations team could not get in contact with the bank. It is my feeling that WF is covering up there mistake and passing the blame on me without saying either way. If the instructions were provided in-correctly then the wire should have been reversed by default. This has been an ongoing issue for over 3 months at this point, I am livid with the pace of this and require answers. I am coming to the conclusion that Wells Fargo is purposely with-holding my funds due to the impending recession."
1655,I purchased tickets through an ad I found on XXXX. I asked the seller to use XXXX but he insisted on XXXX. Because XXXX is backed by Wells Fargo I assumed it was safe. Also it is not clear that they do not offer fraud protection. I paid the person {$250.00} and no tickets were ever given. I have contacted XXXX as the tickets he sent me photos of were from them and also contacted my bank Wells Fargo. WF told me they would not do anything until I filed a police report. The police would not file a report and told me to file with the fbi. I have since filed a report for fraud and scam with the fbi but Wells Fargo will still not help me or back the purchase.

According to XXXX XXXX, he was out of the country. The vehicle was his XXXX 's and he preferred to use a broker to finalize the sale. The money would be wired to them, they would hold the money until I received the vehicle, and after 7 days if nothing was wrong with the vehicle, the sale would be final. The purchase price included shipping to me in XXXX, SC. So, the afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX, I wired the money to the auto broker 's account with XXXX. I was in contact with XXXX XXXX, who was the sales manager with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He sent me a Bill of Sale, I signed it, and sent it back to him vie email. he then sent me wiring instructions, and I went to my XXXX XXXX branch and wired the funds to the XXXX account referenced in the wiring instructions. I was then in contact with XXXX XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX. That was the last day I spoke to either party. I emailed and called them with no response. On Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX, I searched the sellers email address on XXXX and his email address was mentioned over 10 times, quoting the exact words to me in his email, but for different cars. The next morning I called XXXX, got in touch with a man by the name of XXXX in their Wire Fraud Department. I told him what happened, he froze the account and advised me to get XXXX to send him a Hold Harmless Letter so they could send the funds back and also he would send a SWIFT message to them to let them know what happened and that this was possibly a fraud attempt. I then went to see a banker in the XXXX XXXX branch of XXXX XXXX by the name of XXXX XXXX. He started a claim for me because it was an in-branch transaction. It is XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX XXXX refuses to send XXXX the information they need to release the funds back to me.

1661,"I accessed my Wells Fargo account on-line in order to make a transfer from my checking account to another bank ( XX/XX/XXXX ). While entering the transfer information, I recognized that the last four digits of the XXXX XXXX account had been changed, and did not match the actual account numbers for XXXX. I stopped the transfer and called the Fraud and Security number at Wells Fargo, and deleted the transfer information for XXXX XXXX. I also sent an e-mail to Wells Fargo telling them that someone internal to Wells Fargo had changed the account numbers, and any transfer I made would not have been to my actual XXXX account. ( This was the second time I had the numbers on an account changed ; my Wells Fargo savings account numbers were changed about 3 years ago. My HRA deposited all my health reimbursements to that account, and caught the change in account numbers and called me. ) The phone call to the fraud unit resulted in the Wells Fargo unit cutting off my access to their on-line website, and then refusing to reinstate service until I went to a branch office to prove my identity ; they would not accept my SS number or my information on my checking account activity, such as last deposit made. I went to the branch office on XX/XX/XXXX, and a bank officer made the calls to their fraud unit to get my access to my own accounts reinstated. In spite of the bank officer calling from her office, and having my drivers ' license, checkbook, and all my information, the customer service person ( XXXX? ) proceeded to interrogate me and refused to give me access to my account until she completely went through her procedures. After an hour and 10 minutes, the bank officer tried to re-establish my access on-line, but it was still blocked. After we were put on hold several times, a new voice said our wait time would be 20 minutes more. We terminated the call and the bank officer said she would file a formal complaint, and would keep trying to gain access. She was unsuccessful, and I had to return to the branch office on XX/XX/XXXX. She again called an internal Wells Fargo unit, and we were successful in reinstating my access to my account. At no time was there any concern about the account numbers being changed. I am now in the process of getting 4 direct deposit monthly payments changed to another bank ; I have closed my savings account and deleted all other transfer accounts. Again, Wells Fargo never addressed the core issue of account numbers being changed internally by unknown Wells Fargo personnel."

1664,XX/XX/18 XXXX XXXX XXXX IL : I was paying for tickets tonight ( {$220.00} ) from a guy I met on XXXX and it all seemed very legit. I used XXXX through my Wells Fargo bank app. I figured it was completely secure and Wells Fargo could solve anything if a problem arose. The guy was a scam so I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and apparently they could do absolutely nothing. That is crazy that a huge bank institution could advertise a company like XXXX but it not even be secure. It makes me want to switch banks! There needs to be warning signs or they should stop working with them! I hoped my bank could do more to help me because we have been with them for years and do a ton of business with them!
1665,"ID # XXXX claim XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Thu, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX  ( 2 days ago ) to XXXX Wells Fargo CEO Dear Mr. XXXX : I want your help I spent the last 10 days speaking to numerous Wells Fargo employees explaining the situation pertaining to this wire transfer made from my Wells Fargo personal checking account 2 a another Wells Fargo business account from a client residing in Florida. I was lead to many different Wells Fargo departments and phone numbers and spent hours and hours on the phone trying to get to the right people. I'm a retired XXXX XXXX vet and I also used to run my own credit restoration business and I understand the protocols of disputing and also the laws pertaining to credit. But wire transfers are a little different but the thing that's upsetting to me is that the Wells Fargo institution before I was making this so-called purchase misinformed me back in XXXX as I specifically asked if I was being scammed by a merchant and made a wire transfer without receiving the merchandise in this case at XXXX would the bank be able to retrieve my money and the representative told me they would stand behind me not to worry about it. Little did I know I made the mistake of trusting someone that wasn't fully informed on protocol and procedure. This current claim which has been open about four times due to the Wells Fargo Associates missing either the dollar figure or initiating the claim incorrectly took this long to finally be presented properly as of yesterday. I literally have to beg for about a week so I could fax over additional information to support whoever 's actually going to work on this to show that the merchant with a Wells Fargo business account is continually scamming consumers with the same identical situation from others around the u.s.. my investigation also took me where I found out his brother with the same last name had his license revoked so is Sidekick is basically running the business the same way currently. Long story short I purchased a vehicle from XXXX XXXX paid that party through wire transfer online and also paid the deposit portion via XXXX. With the information I provide a XXXX they investigated and found many consumers having a problem therefore refunded my small deposit and also took actions to reprimand the client with a 21-day hold on any payments coming in which they are also eventually going to suspend his account on a permanent basis. As far as Wells Fargo I'm not so confident in the results although this is a new start as of yesterday looking at 4,000 online complaints against your bank and having to reiterate for hours exactly the story for the Wells Fargo so she needs to understand and also being swept away and encouraged to hire an attorney I don't feel this is the result I expected from my bank that's trying to establish a new culture. I am out {$3100.00} and signed no contract for the seller but he's allowed to have a business account and use Wells Fargo as one of his forms of scamming people out of their money. I spoke to an attorney yesterday and he told me to go after the bank and file a suit and also go back after the merchant. But I'm going to hold back that's why I'm writing you and give Wells Fargo the opportunity. I come from a long line of siblings that are Circuit Court judges and lawyers but I'm a very efficient business man myself. I never really ask them for their help. When I was a corporate employee for XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX I was the top dog in the United States with a poster in every store. XXXX XXXX XXXX  was promoting a secured MasterCard I ran that program and when I spoke to the president there mr. XXXX a while back he really wanted me to be a part of the banking Institution and come work for their company because I could do it 10 people can do at once. But those days are no longer I'm older I struggle and I need your help. If I was a Wells Fargo employee I know how I would handle this with the merchant and one phone call I could get him to return the money to the buyer easily. But since I am on the sideline I have to wait for people that are not with a gifted ability or have Innovation at problem solving that think outside of the norm or protocol I don't expect a favorable result. But being a former military person I'm going to do whatever it takes to get my money back but I would like your assistance and help so I don't have to further exhaust myself in this what seems never-ending process. You can check the materials and the reviews for other consumers that I have sent over to support the team that's working on this dispute. But you and I know when you want things really done you go to the top man and that's you. I would appreciate your involvement in the process to recover my money spent with a deceptive party that's using Wells Fargo to take payments from customer and sell them lemons. I expect since I'm a Wells Fargo customer and that the other party it is a Wells Fargo customer also someone to step in and say he doesn't have your item you mess represented your item to the consumer and you are to return his money or face sanctions from our bank I'm sure with his scamming and criminal background which I have already investigated myself. I would say he would come around and this would be resolved. Sometimes a different approach rather than lawyers Works quicker and effective but you need somebody Innovative that knows how to talk. If I was in your office using the phone and representing Wells Fargo rather than myself I could show you how it's done you'd hire me on the spot for a high position. But I'm not once again thank you for your time and would appreciate your effort in resolving I refund concerns with this issue. 

Sincerely XXXX XXXX _____________________________________________________________________"
1666,"Nothing happened, l keep getting scammers callers."
1667,Wells Fargo Closed my online checking account because their no activity for the past 2 months.I understand why they would close it but i would like it to be re-opened.
1670,This is the compliant for the receiving bank. I initialed a wire of XXXX dollars from my XXXX  account to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2020. After half year its never there. XXXX keep telling me they tried to reach Wells Fargo and never got a response for months. Is this even normal? My receiver called and there was no pending wire. I need the money back badly. My XXXX  account number is XXXX.
1675,"On XX/XX/2022, I was contacted from a representative/organization purporting to be XXXX XXXX XXXX Before answering the call, I searched the number online, and it came back as being from XXXX. After receiving confirmation that it was a XXXX number, I answered the call. They claimed that my account was in danger of disconnection, and that I needed to pay my past-due balance in order to avoid disconnection of service. They asked if I was aware of their fast-pay option through XXXX. When I said no, they proceeded to inform me about it and collected a payment of {$120.00} After making the payment, the call disconnected and I immediately called XXXX back. The representative I spoke with informed me that this was likely a scam, and tha that they had received numerous reports from customers who had been similarly defrauded by this very scam. I filed a report with the representative from XXXX and immediately called my bank, Wells Fargo, to report the fraud and begin the investigation process. My initial Wells Fargo claim was denied. Following this, I asked to have the claim escalated to the Executive Office, who also denied my claim, saying that that claim was completed as requested and no bank error occurred."
1676,"Wells Fargo has been denying that they are in violation of the CFPB and refuses to refund the {$3000.00} to me. Clearly based on the facts provided, what the FDIC states and what the CFPB state, Wells Fargo is in violation of EFTA Regulation E. I am attached a letter from my Attorney as well. 
The EFTA is regulated and enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). This US government agency has made it clear that when scammers access accounts by fraud or robbery, the resulting transactions fall into the unauthorized category. The CFPA confirmed that the EFTA protects consumers who have been swindled and the Act requires investigation and reimbursement according to its terms. When a consumer is tricked or manipulated into allowing access to their account, all related transfers are considered unauthorized. 
I was a victim of fraud through a phone call scam. The scammer asked me to send money through XXXX. After the money was sent, I realized that this was a scam and I called Wells Fargo immediately to inform them. I also filed a police report with the XXXX county police department. I have a letter from the Attorney General stating that my situation was a fraudulent scam. 
EFTA and Regulation E states that an unauthorized EFT includes any transfer initiated by a person who obtained an access device through fraud, robbery, or force. My situation falls under fraud! The CFPB made clear that a consumer is entitled to receive the liability protections of Regulation E, even if that consumer acted negligently. 
Wells Fargo is in violation and {$3000.00} should be refunded back to my account."
1677,"On XX/XX/2022, my wife was called by a person purporting to be a police officer notifying her that a warrant had been issued for her arrest for failing to appear for Jury Duty. 

She was required to send XXXX payments to clear the matter. 

She did so in the amount {$3000.00} ( 2 transactions of {$1500.00} each ). Within minutes of the transactions, I contacted the local sheriff who confirmed it was a scam. 

We immediately contacted Wells Fargo Bank ( within 10 minutes of the transactions ) and they claimed they could do nothing about it."
1678,"I received a job application through my university ( XXXX XXXX University ) email account from a student email. The email pretended to be XXXX with an attached screenshot of what the job entitled ( I have the screenshot of what the job was that was included in the email. I will attach it below ). I took the job thinking it was real since the school let it slip through their security and there wasnt any warnings. The scammers emailed me a check of {$3500.00} and told me to deposit it into my account. When the money was available, they said I needed to go out and buy supplies for orphanages. Then they quickly changed that and said the orphanage did not want any outside help due to the pandemic and asked if I could XXXX the money instead. I Zelled {$3000.00} to one person and they told me to keep the extra {$500.00}. Then they sent me another check and asked me to do the same thing. This time they asked me to XXXX someone {$2000.00} and XXXX someone else {$1000.00}. Unfortunately, I fell for it and then realized it was a scam when they asked me to buy gift cards for them. I immediately cut them off and contacted XXXX and my bank who said they would file a claim. XXXX said there was nothing they could do and said I lost {$2000.00}. My bank ( Wells Fargo ) filed a claim and said it would take 10 days to let me know. 14 days went by and I heard nothing until I called them to ask about an update. Wells Fargo said my claim was denied, yet no one had emailed me or called me to let me know. I lost {$7000.00} that I never even had and no one helped me. My account was at- {$6500.00} for weeks. I have filed multiple claims and I have received nothing and no help."
1679,"I received a reciept from someone who has account with wells fargo to transfer fund of XXXX and he gave me reference id XXXX and asked me to pay XXXX rupees XXXX on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX as International transfer tax charge. So I paid XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to an XXXX account. 
Again on same day I received another email to pay XXXX as currency conversion charges. So on same day I transferred XXXX to same XXXX account. 
Later on Received another mail to pay XXXX as sn activation charges and gave me time for 48 hours. which I was unable to. 
After so many hassle after two weeks I was able to arrange the money. 
On XX/XX/2020 I again transfered the amount XXXX to an XXXX account but this time it was different account.. On XX/XX/XXXX again I was asked to pay XXXX as late fee. so on same day I tranfered the amount. 
After that on XX/XX/2020 i was again asked to pay XXXX to release the payment as currency conversion charges. After fee hours I am.again asked to.pay XXXX to release the fund. which I refused to pay they said if i make this payment momey would be credited within 2 hours. But after making payment I am askes to.pay more. So on XX/XX/XXXX i paid XXXX and they confirmed me i would get the money refunded within an hour. now again they are asking me to pay XXXX I asked who are this XXXX people they said XXXX income tax department. 
Every now and then I am being asked to pay. 
After my last payment there is no reply from wells fargo. 
I have attached few documents I will send once it would be asked"
1680,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by a woman named XXXX XXXX who claimed to be a job recruiter from a company called XXXX and she got my resume from indeed. I was interviewed on XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and was hired on XX/XX/XXXX. I received {$4100.00} via check on XX/XX/XXXX in which {$400.00} was processed on that day and the remainder of it the next day. So the check cleared and the funds were available in my account. XXXX claimed the money was too pay for the work equipment I would receive for the job which she sent a list for. I was instructed to send {$1000.00} too a person and that was done via XXXX then she instructed me to send to another person whos names didnt match up. So after I notified my bank and it was a bad check and the scanner got XXXX. After weeks of contacting the FTC, Wellsfargo, XXXX and the fbis online fraud I have not gotten any help with retrieving my lost funds. My bank hasnt done anything besides contact the scammers bank and try to offer a refund too no avail. Now my account is in the negatives and I cant even close it out."
1681,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated a rollover of a 401k to an IRA with the stated intent on taking a one time dispersement for a down payment on a home. I was sure to inform Wells Fargo of this purpose. I was told "" a couple of weeks '' for the entire process to be completed. The IRA was created on XX/XX/2018. I promptly submitted the distribution form that same date at XXXX to the email XXXX as instructed with an expedite ticket number of XXXX. I was told it would be fully complete in 5-7 business days. I have had to make multiple calls with Wells Fargo agents unable to locate the form, unable to find the underlying account, and insisting I had to start the process over. In total, 10 calls have been made regarding this. On XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX, I was instructed to resubmit the form to the same email above and it would be processed within 24 hours. This did not occur. In a call back to voicemail on XX/XX/2018, I was notified that in response to my inquiry they were unable to find any evidence of a submitted form. 

The continued delays, obfuscation, and inconsistent messages are materially interfering in my contractual obligations with the sellers of the home I seek to purchase. A closing date for the home has been delayed 3 times as a result of the incompetence and misdirection of Wells Fargo 's investment services team. This is my money. This should be a routine transaction that is common for 1st time home buyers. I insist they release my funds to me on an expedited basis. Any assistance in securing this result would be appreciated."
1683,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received a text message from Wells Fargo noting suspicious activity in my account and asking me to verify ( respond 'Yes ' or 'No ' ) to a {$3500.00} XXXX transaction to a XXXX XXXX XXXX I responded 'No ' and received a follow-up text message letting me know that a Wells Fargo fraud agent would be in touch shortly. I then received a phone call from a phone number showing up on my phone as Wells Fargo Bank who was in fact someone impersonating a Wells Fargo banking agent. They asked me to confirm that I did not authorize this XXXX transaction for {$3500.00} and then asked me to log into the Wells Fargo mobile app to verify my XXXX account information by transferring {$630.00} to myself via XXXX. After doing so, they hung up the phone and all the money in my bank account ( {$630.00} ) had been removed. I immediately called Wells Fargo to open a claim regarding the online fraud. I was told an agent would be in touch within 10 business days. After waiting 10 days and not hearing from anyone I called back and was told someone would be in touch within the next two business days. Eventually I received a letter from Wells Fargo saying they had requested the receiving bank account to return the money to my account, but the request had been denied and they had subsequently closed my claim. 
I called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX to follow up and was told that transfers made through XXXX are not covered by the bank 's fraud protection services and the stolen {$630.00} would not be refunded. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I went into my local Wells Fargo branch in XXXX XXXX, NC and asked the manager to appeal my claim which she did. I received another letter shortly thereafter letting me know the appeal had been denied on the grounds that I had made the XXXX transfer even though it was from and to my own Wells Fargo account. 
Upon subsequent research I determined under Regulation E of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), banks are responsible for reimbursing customers in full when an unauthorized transaction takes place and the transaction is reported within 60 days. Furthermore, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) is on record as stating that such scams are considered unauthorized electronic fund transfers ( EFTs ) under federal law and are therefore covered by the EFTA. The CFPB FAQ section states, "" an unauthorized EFT includes a transfer initiated by a person who obtained the access device from the consumer through fraud or robbery '' and "" an unauthorized EFT is when a consumer is fraudulently induced into sharing account access information with a third party, and a third party uses that information to make an EFT from the consumers account. '' ( please see attached support - "" XXXX 's XXXX '' ). The CFPB is also on record as stating on XX/XX/XXXX that "" Consumers expect certain assurances when dealing with companies that move their money. They expect to be protected from fraud and payments made in error, for their data and privacy to be protected and not shared without their consent, to have responsive customer service, and to be treated equally under relevant law. The orders seek to understand the robustness with which payment platforms prioritize consumer protection under law. Finally, there is precedent for multiple banks including Wells Fargo, XXXX & XXXX, XXXX and XXXX  XXXX XXXX reimbursing customers in full in multiple instances of theft with substantially the same fact patterns as my case."
1684,"Transferred money from my XXXX XXXX account to my Wells Fargo account via XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX has given me receipt numbers from Wells Fargo that they have the money since XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo however says they dont recognise these numbers and the money is with XXXX XXXX. 

The numbers XXXX XXXX claims Wells Fargo gave them for the XXXX transactions are XXXX and XXXX. 

I am stuck between these XXXX where they both are not sorting out my problem and the only thing they say is the other has the money and i should contact them."
1685,"On the night of XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX I received several missed calls from a number tagged "" Wells Fargo XXXX '' The number was the same service number as on the back of my bank card. Earlier in the week ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I was informed that my account information may have been compromised and I was being sent a new card ( see attached picture ). The information about the new card/account information being compromised was legitimately from Wells Fargo . When I finally picked up the call on the night of the XXXX, I was told that there were fraudulent charges pending on my account due to my account being compromised and that I would need to use my XXXX account to transfer the money back into my account. The amount was for {$1000.00}. The person on the other end seemed to know how much money was in my account, that I was with Wells Fargo and that my account had been compromised. I dont know how this person could have access to that information unless they are affiliated with Wells Fargo .

In order to transfer the money back into my account I only had to read a code from my text message to authorize money being sent back to myself/stop the pending fraud charges. 
I realized very quickly that the money had been taken from my account only with the code I read aloud. The money was transferred to someone from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXas shown in my text messages after the money was taken from my account. 

I contacted Wells Fargo immediately ( within 1 minute after I hung up ) to see what could be done. They immediately recognized the scam/fraud and said that it had happened a lot that night. They called it a fraud, but later denied my claim and denied that it was a fraud, saying I authorized the transaction. I was coerced into giving information ( code from my phone ) which I was falsely led to believe was stopping a pending fraud charge. 
Wells Fargo made a report, but have not returned my money that I lost -- {$1000.00}. They have opened and closed the claim multiple times, but I have not given me my money back. It is closed now. I believe I am covered under regulation E and I am asking for help getting my money back. Thank you for your help in this stressful time."
1686,"Hello, I am not sure if I am submitting this into the right section, but I am hoping so. I made a transaction on XXXX with a XXXX  seller. She claimed to have tickets to a XXXX game, two for {$350.00}. I paid her and two minutes later she claimed it didnt process. I checked and it showed she received the money and it was taken out of my account. I told her this and she tried to claim I still needed to pay her again. I said I was not comfortable and wanted my money back. The money is still out of my account and into hers. Both XXXX and my bank, Wells Fargo, are not being of much help with anything as of now. I have involved the police, and we are trying to further investigate."
1687,"On XX/XX/2022 I received multiple texts messages from what said to be Wells Fargo asking if I approved XXXX transfers for various amounts totaling {$22000.00}. ( This is how Wells Fargo normally asked if Ive approved a transaction ) I replied no to the text message, which was followed by a phone call saying Wells Fargo with a phone number identical to the one on the back of my debit card. The caller said they were following up on my reply that I had not approved the wire transfers that I had received text messages about. The caller explained that the transfers were done illegally through a scam and since it was done by wire transfer on the XXXX XXXX and I am on the XXXX XXXX, he would assist me in transferring the money back to my account before it funded East Coast time. He went through a series of security questions to reassure me, as I was very upset and unsure. He instructed me step by step how to log on to XXXX and even sent a security passcode. He walked me through steps to transfer the 1st transaction for {$3500.00} and then said wed continue with the rest. Something in his demeanor changed and I told him I would feel more comfortable going into my branch office and hung up. I immediately went to my branch within 5 minutes of making the transfer and quickly explained to the banker what was happening. The banker told me this was a very well known scam happening to Wells Fargo customers and he would call the Fraud Dept with me to try to fix the issue. We were on hold for a very long time and disconnected multiple times before he was able to speak to someone who would open a fraud case and help resolve the issue. Days passed with no follow up, so I called the number provide with my case number only to be transferred around, be disconnected, to eventually be told the case was being investigated. I finally received an email saying my case had been investigated and researched and closed. This was hard to believe, as I had never been contacted or spoken to anyone about my case. Wells Fargo was very well aware of this scam and did nothing to warn its customers. The email concluded by saying the transfer was completed as requested. Basically a generic email. I called and reopened the case three more times, finally able to speak to a specialist and explain what I had learned about Regulation E. I received an email stating the following : The medias interpretation of Reg. E does not align with our interpretation and review of XXXX. XXXX or the FAQs issued by the CFPB this summer. Although we understand that there can be different readings of the FAQs, we currently still believe that the requirement for an unauthorized transaction is as defined by Reg. E : an electronic fund transfer from a consumer 's account initiated by a person other than the consumer without actual authority to initiate the transfer and from which the consumer receives no benefit. 

I have read multiple articles from government agencies stating that my exact type of fraud is covered under Regulation E. Wells Fargo chooses to interpret the law differently. 
I believe laws are to be followed, not interpreted as best suits the institution. 
This has been going on for well over a month. Wells Fargo is well insured for Fraud, I the consumer am not. I would so appreciate help in finding resolution to this. Thank you in advance for your help."
1689,"On XX/XX/XXXX I sent {$300.00} in payment to someone who did work at our house. We had just moved out of state and he asked me to send it via XXXX. The phone number was entered wrong by ( 1 ) digit. When I contacted XXXX- they told me to contact my bank- Well Fargo. I filed a complaint that the money was sent to the wrong person and I had no way to cancel the payment. They said they would investigate it. Today, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Wells Fargo saying they had completed the investigation and said "" the transaction was completed as requested ''. This is not true. This was sent to the wrong person and now I still owe the other {$300.00}! 

There is a history of this with XXXX and other banks if you research this. At least XXXX has a more secure way to send money. I am XXXX, retired on Social Security. Please help me get my {$300.00} back."
1690,"On XX/XX/2022 I was contacted by someone calling from Wells Fargo Customer Service. It appeared as the correct number, but was a scammer. I had just applied for a personal loan a few moments before, so I answered thinking it may have something to do with that. The person on the other end told me that they were calling from Wells Fargo because someone had tried to send themselves money from my checking account through XXXX. He said that WF can't interfere with a XXXX transaction, but that if I created an account and sent the money back to myself, it would reverse the transaction. I did so twice, first sending {$1000.00} and then {$440.00}. I want to be clear that the only information I entered when making this transaction was my OWN name and phone number. The attached bank document will show that I sent the money to myself ( or so I thought ). I never authorized a transaction to send to an outside account or any other person, therefore making this FRAUD, not an authorized transaction as WF is claiming. About ten minutes after hanging up, I realized something was strange and called WF to report the incident. After waiting the recommended ten days, I still had heard nothing so I called them and was told my case had been closed ( without notification to myself ) and that the bank said there was nothing they could do since I authorized the transaction. Again, I do not feel that I authorized this transaction as I thought I was simply sending money to my own account. I was told that they have no way of knowing if I was complicit in the fraud ; but if they suspect something like that, why did they approve me for a personal loan of $ XXXX? I plan on closing my accounts ( I've already closed my savings account ) and moving my money to a credit union. I've also been interviewed by a local news station regarding this matter."
1691,"XX/XX/XXXX - Due to increased costs for my mom 's managed care my husband requested a disbursement from his retirement fund, now administered by Wells Fargo. 

An electronic transaction was requested, but the Wells Fargo representative told him that they could not use EFT with our bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The representative refused to tell him why, just reiterated that it was not possible. 

He was told that a paper check could be sent. When my husband again requested that the funds be disbursed by EFT as he didn't feel comfortable with a check that large being sent via regular, not registered or express mail as it couldnt be tracked, he was again refused with no reason other than that they could not communicate with XXXX electronically. 

He was asked for his information to send the check. While giving his address he discovered that Wells Fargo had an incorrect zip code on file for us. The zip code they had on file for us is our old XXXX XXXX zip code, codes were changed 7 years ago or more. He corrected Wells Fargo 's representative but was told they couldn't correct the zip code for him. Mind you, they can disburse funds to an incorrect address, but can't correct the zip code! He agreed to the paper check as he didn't realize that the post office was no longer correcting for the zip code change. He was asked for the amount and asked if he wanted taxes deducted from the total. He gave them an amount and told them to deduct the taxes. 

XX/XX/XXXX - The check had not arrived and my husband called Wells Fargo and was told it would arrive in 10 business days and to wait till that amount of time had passed. He asked if they could tell him if the funds had been disbursed and the check mailed. He was told that the check had been mailed XX/XX/XXXX due to the XX/XX/XXXX holiday and given an amount of the disbursement. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX appx. We had reached 10 business days and the check hadn't arrived. My husband called Wells Fargo and was told that the check was mailed XX/XX/XXXX. This is not what he was told during the first call. He was also given an incorrect amount for the disbursement it didnt tally with the amount he was given during the first call. 

XX/XX/XXXX same call - I asked to speak to the representative and asked why they couldn't send an EFT to our credit union. They at first refused to tell me, but when I asked if it had to do with incoming and outgoing bank fees the representative said that it was actually because our credit union is not a subscriber to service called XXXX XXXX. THIS WAS NEVER DISCLOSED, IN PRINT, EMAIL OR ANY OTHER WAY TO CUSTOMERS OF WELLS FARGO. This was admitted by the representative on the call. 

XX/XX/XXXX same call - I asked to talk to a supervisor. Once connected I remarked that I hoped the call was recorded and was told that it would be. I heard no tone to indicate that it was being recorded. I asked to have the information on the XXXX XXXX   process and the list of institutions on it emailed to me. I was told that it couldn't be emailed. I asked for it to be sent via regular mail and was told that wasn't possible either. The supervisor said that if I went to the website earlywarning.com I would find all the information there. That's not true. I can't find a list of subscribing banks or financial institutions on the site. So Wells Fargo subscribes to a service that severely limits the institutions that it will transact with and does not at any time, unless openly confronted by an absolutely enraged customer, disclose this. When I pointed out that at no time was this method of doing business disclosed, and that in fact their policy actually constituted non-disclosure, I was coldly told that I could at any time go or have gone to earlywarning.com for the information I wanted. It is not my duty as a customer to anticipate and request disclosure of harmful or restrictive business practices. I would have absolutely no way of doing such a thing since I wouldnt know they were in place unless disclosed to me. Thats why disclosure laws exist. It simply wouldnt have been possible at any time prior to this call to have gone to XXXX XXXX since Wells Fargo had never disclosed to us that we were restricted in the institutions that we could use for electronic transactions. 

I asked the supervisor what would happen if I wanted to do a roll-over of the entirety of our funds by EFT to a banking institution on their list. I was told that Wells Fargo would not do an EFT for a rollover, even with one of their partner banks that subscribes to the XXXX XXXX service. They will cut and send a paper check for the entire amount. This is extremely risky and is not normal business practice in this day and age. I asked why they cant do an EFT with another financial institution subscribing to XXXX XXXX and was stonewalled. To send a huge check through the mail is simply reckless and endangers both the customer and the financial institution sending such a check. I admit I was pretty heated by this time and I hope you can get a copy of the supposedly recorded call, because the supervisor was not helpful, customer-oriented, solution-oriented, or in any way trying to de-escalate the situation. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX appx. We called our credit union to check on the accuracy of the information given to us on the funds transfer. Their representative told us that they definitely can accept incoming Wells Fargo transactions and that in fact they had credit union customers who were Wells Fargo employees and had their checks regularly electronically deposited. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Went to the XXXX site to find the list of subscribing institutions that we were told by the Wells Fargo supervisor was posted there. There is NO search function and NO list of subscribing institutions. All information on the site is basically advertising and forms to dispute your credit check if you have been refused service by a member bank due to inaccurate credit reporting by XXXX XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX - Called the federal government to find the correct bank regulation authority and make a complaint. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Called the CFPB to lodge a complaint. I explained the situation at some length and was given help. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX appx. - After determining which local branch of the post office would handle mail for our range of zip codes my husband physically went to the post office to see if the Wells Fargo check had arrived but not been sorted out due to the incorrect zip code. He was told by the post office branch manager that they no longer corrected for the XXXX zip code change and that mail with an incorrect zip code for the address would be automatically returned. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX - My husband returned home and called Wells Fargo back and asked to have the check voided and requested to have another one issued. Wells Fargo refused to void the check, stating that the zip code had to be corrected before they would void it and issue another check. NOTE THAT THEY ISSUED THE FIRST ONE AFTER REFUSING TO CORRECT THE ZIP CODE. When he asked them to correct the zip code they again refused to do it. He asked them if we could have the funds wired to my mothers Wells Fargo account and was told they could only be wired to an account with his name on it. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX appx. - We called my husband 's employer, XXXX XXXX, and asked them to correct the zip code as it proved to be impossible to correct on the Wells Fargo website or over the phone with them. His employer has now corrected the zip code. I explained the situation at some length, and complained that we had no issues till the funds were given to Wells Fargo to manage. Our employer was informed that we will be rolling over the 401K into another account. We were advised by HR that a representative for our Wells Fargo plan would contact us tomorrow ( XX/XX/XXXX ) in the morning. As they will have no power to regulate or change Wells Fargos restrictive manner of trade there is little to hope for from this interaction. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX We now realized we would have to wait till the following day to get the check voided and there will most likely be a waiting period before funds can be returned to our account. This point was not clarified by either of the representatives we talked to ; in fact we are still going to have to call them back yet again to get clarification. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX - We went to the web page for our retirement account, filtered for transactions between XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX and found the distribution transaction. Since we had been told two different things by two customer service representatives on  separate dates we didnt trust either the fact that a transaction had been made, or that the amount was correct. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX My husband called the local Wells Fargo branch to ask if it was possible to open an account and how long it would take for the account to be active and able to accept an EFT transaction. He was told that if he opened an account with {$25.00} before XXXX XXXX PST it would be instantly active. As it turned out this information was both untrue and deceptive. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX In order to pay for my moms care and not have her turned out of her retirement home my husband went to my sons credit union and borrowed money from him. Its now too late to deposit the funds into our credit union and we have received a very disturbing call from the retirement facility. 

XX/XX/XXXX after XXXX - In order to have an account available that can accept funds disbursed in an EFT, so they could be received as soon as possible after having the existing check voided, my husband then went to Wells Fargo and opened a checking account using {$25.00}. The intent was to only have this account open long enough to receive one transaction and then immediately withdraw all funds and close it. 

XX/XX/XXXX after XXXX My husband talked with the bank teller when he opened the account and was told that an EFT could not process through this account for two weeks. They had no information on what might cause the wait. I have now found evidence that the two week restriction is so that subscribing institutions can credit check through the XXXX XXXX service. This should have been disclosed by the Wells Fargo bank representative who opened the account for my husband. My husband called Wells Fargo customer service again and asked if they could see the zip code change. Since they could see the zip code change instantly when his employer corrected it, he asked if he could have the current check voided and a new check cut and mailed tomorrow, XX/XX/XXXX. I have absolutely no hope that it will arrive, or that the funds initially disbursed will be returned to our retirement account by Wells Fargo. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX appx. - At this point I decided to do some more research on the XXXX XXXX website and here is a direct quote from their site : XXXX XXXX is owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXX, and Wells Fargo. So in effect by using a service created and owned by them these banks are restricting the trade of other institutions that dont subscribe to the service. THIS IS RESTRAINT OF TRADE, AS THE ONLY WAY TO GET A TIMELY DISBURSEMENT BY EFT FROM OUR FUND NOW MANAGED BY WELLS FARGO IS TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT WITH WELLS FARGO OR ONE OF THEIR PARTNER BANKS. ( Please consult federal government and legal authorities on this point, but my immediate referral is to this link : XXXX XXXX XXXX ) In short, a restraint of trade is any activity that hinders someone else from doing business in the way that he would normally do it if there were no restraints. While federal, state, and local governments can pass laws and regulations that create obstacles for certain kinds of businesses, it is generally considered improper for individuals to restrain one anothers trade in certain ways. Someone who loses business or suffers another injury may have a tort case against another individual whose trade-restraining behavior injured him. I would definitely say that not being able to receive needed funds because of an undisclosed restrictive business practice that may cause my mother to lose her place in her care facility is harmful  behavior and has definitely caused very real injury, both financial and in the form of mental anguish. 

The result of this is that we no longer trust Wells Fargo to act in a professional or ethical manner. We will be rolling over my husbands retirement account into another fund as we do not want to deal with Wells Fargo any longer. Not only do they restrict the trade of other banks by preventing them from using an accepted means of transaction, the EFT, they effectively restrict unknowing and unwilling consumers to using only certain banks if they need to exchange electronic transactions. In fact, this whole incident seems to point to a direct attempt by Wells Fargo to increase their own and partner banks business. Early Warning is a limited liability company owned by XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX,. Im sure any of those institutions would be an acceptable EFT partner, but we dont bank with any of them currently and will not be forced to by Wells Fargo to bank with either them or one of their partners in the future. The only solution if we want to make electronic transactions with our banking institution is to withdraw all funds from our 401K and find another fund in an institution not managed by, belonging to, or doing business with XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX , XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXX, Wells Fargo or XXXX XXXX. This is a definite hardship and I would say extremely restrictive for the average consumer. 

Hidden business practices that put their customers at a financial disadvantage or force them to change their financial institution are not only restrictive, they are unethical business practices obviously intended to forcefully increase the business of XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX , XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXXXXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX at consumers expense. To have such bald disregard for the distress caused to the customer who has to uncover these restrictive practices during a family crisis is unconscionable. They effectively escalated what was a manageable situation with my mothers managed care by preventing us from receiving funds in a timely manner. Since this non-disclosure and hidden back checking is the standard practice of Wells Fargo we hope to be able to influence my husbands employer to seek other fund management. I also hope to be able to have my own employer change their fund management from Wells Fargo Advisors to the company that previously managed our retirement fund. Although we realize that this institution will in no way care or even notice the loss we still believe this will be in the best interest of the hapless employees now badly served by Wells Fargo."
1692,"Our wedding venue ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) had sent us final payment information XX/XX/22 with wire transfer instructions for {$5100.00} to a Wells Fargo account. The Wells Fargo account name in the wire instructions was the venue 's name ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and the email was sent from the venue 's email address as a response to an existing email thread. We paid off our final balance via wire transfer to the Wells Fargo account as instructed by our venue and emailed the payment receipt also as instructed. In the following weeks, we received XXXX automated emails from our venue that our balance was overdue so we responded immediately to those emails with the receipts that we had sent previously and received response back from our venue that they can confirm with their accounting department regarding receipt of our payment. 

On XX/XX/22, we received phone call from our venue that their email account had actually been hacked and the wire transfer instructions were from the hacker thus the venue never actually received the money we transferred and money had been stolen by the hacker via the Wells Fargo Account. We immediately called our bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) who stated they would investigate as well and we also filed a police report with our local XXXX XXXX Police Department. 

On XX/XX/22, the venue said they have been in contact with Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX Police Department. The venue told us their insurance will not cover this case. We also called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/22 but were told that Wells Fargo would not help us. We were informed by our bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) that they could not recover the money as the hacker/thief had already stolen the funds. Thus we are filing a claim regarding this theft that Wells Fargo was involved with."
1693,"I asked Wells Fargo to issue a cashier 's check for {$3600.00} on XX/XX/2021. This check was then mailed out and lost in transit. I went to one of their branches on XX/XX/2021, to place a stop payment on that check to prevent it from being cashed by anyone who might have possessed it. The stop payment was placed successfully, and they told me that I had to wait 3 months for the check to be reissued and paid to me. During this visit, I specifically asked the banker if someone tries to cash the check, will it affect me getting my money back in time, and they answered no. 

In XX/XX/2021, after the 3-month waiting period, a banker contacted me and informed me that someone attempted to cash this check during the waiting period. Though the attempt was not successful, I would now not be able to get the check reissued and have my money back. They told me that I had to instead wait for 3 years. 

Wells Fargo confirmed that the money is still with the bank, and I am the owner of the money. Therefore, it is unreasonable for them to hold it. Additionally, this new 3-year waiting period had never been communicated to me before. 

I filed with Wells Fargo an internal complaint, which they told me would be resolved within about 10 business days, and yet they took over a month to arrive at a resolution, which is that I still have to wait for 3 years. During their investigation, they extended the timeline multiple times and changed the case specialist without notifying me. I tried reaching out but got line-busy / unable to reach multiple times."
1695,"I deposited a check from my mother to my checking account. Her bank has released the funds, yet Wells Fargo is still holding on to it and not depositing the funds to my account so they can draw interest on it for a week. I find this highly suspicious and seems illegal to me."

I called Wells Fargo immediately and reported the unauthorized transaction. They set up claim # XXXX and told me they will investigate what happened and asked what time of day I was available so that they could call me for questions. Wells Fargo never contacted me after this. I also had to ask Wells Fargo to change my user ID and password to prevent anymore theft from the hackers. 
The following are phone number the hackers used to contact me. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. The hackers sent me a text and told me they could give me my money back if I called them. I ignored their calls and texts. I also filed a police report XXXX with XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX, IA police department. 
Today I received an email from Wells Fargo stating that the payment was processed as requested. I did not request nor authorize this or do it myself. There was no request from me. The only people that requested it our the criminals that stole the funds. Regulation E states they must return my funds for this unauthorized withdrawal. XXXX even states this on their website. Wells Fargo is incorrect stating that I authorized people to steal from me."

They assured me it was Wells Fargo by saying this is a recorded line and you can confirm because Im calling from the number on the back of your debit card. They said they have noticed some fraudulent transactions on my account. They said the froze my account and were going to work on getting my money back. I logged into my account said my funds were fine and they said we froze them so you wont see transactions, they continued to tell me they were going to help get my money back. They never asked for any of my Information, they even knew I had a savings account. They knew EVERY single XXXX  step on what I would be seeing and what steps were next. I ended up transferring {$1000.00}, {$1000.00}, and {$1000.00}. They sounded legit, even putting me on hold, I was getting an email with the name XXXX XXXX from XXXXXXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX XXXX at the same time all this was going on so I thought it was weird, and access codes.

They then proceeded to close the account and would not discuss the issue further. I filed an executive complaint which did not help. On XX/XX/XXXX another claim was filed with the correct transactions ( all 20 ) and again they denied it without providing reasoning.

1708,"I have been working with a company by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to assist in the cancellation of a timeshare contract and my husband and I have. We have been working with this company since XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a voicemail message from a XXXX XXXX that said that she was with XXXX and had some good news for me concerning our timeshare situation. The number ID ( XXXX ) said it was from XXXX and I had remembered speaking to someone by that name before. When I called her back, she introduced herself as a associate of XXXX and said that our account had finally settled and the only thing left to do was to pay a title transfer fee to XXXX XXXX to finalize the deal. 

I was hesitant about using XXXX to pay this {$1000.00} fee but she mentioned the exact date that we signed our agreement with XXXX and the amount that we paid for our services. The fact that she knew this detailed information was reassuring and I was so excited that our battle with the timeshare company was coming to a close. {$1000.00} is not a small amount of money for us since we have been struggling since Covid. I'm self employed and my business was almost non-existent for over a year while we were dealing with this epidemic. 

Her instructions were to XXXX the money to XXXX XXXXXXXX with XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and after about XXXX business days I should get the agreement from XXXX XXXX. After getting the agreement all I needed to do was sign, notarize it and send it back and the matter would be done. I let one full week go by and started feeling uneasy when nothing came. I finally reached out to XXXX 's number on XX/XX/XXXX and got no response. I called XXXX 's main #, spoke to a representative when they informed me that other people had been scammed the same as me and they had filed a police report on the incidents. 

I then proceeded to call Wells Fargo 's fraud departement, who I bank with, to report the fraud and place my own report. The customer service rep with the Fraud Department gave me her condolences and said that I was not the first person to report this scam to them. My complaint is that they knew about this scam and are not reimbursing me my {$1000.00} because I sent it through XXXX. This is a ridiculous excuse since my money is supposed to be protected. I had every reason to believe that I was dealing with a legitimate representative of a company that I had been in contract with for over 2 years. I need the {$1000.00} that was taken from me and am asking for your assistance to get it back. Thank you."

I then transferred {$200.00} on XX/XX/2018 from my savings account. 

This jeweler has never followed through in making the ring and has failed to reimburse me. 

I attempted to file a claim of fraud through Wells Fargo and was told that since I technically approved the transaction there was nothing they could do for me.

So I quickly open my Wells Fargo app to double check and sure enough I have some fraudulent activity on my account. I instantly contact Wells Fargo 's Fraud Department to report the transaction. The gentlemen over the over quickly closed and canceled my old account and opened me a one. He claimed the transactions were still pending and he would put a hold on them until further investigation. I told him no investigating needed, because that's the reason why I'm calling you, to report this fraud. He proceeds to give me a case number and tells me I should recieve my money in about 5 days. It is now XX/XX/2022 and no email or phone calls from Wells Fargo. So I decide to call and check up on the status of the case. Over the phone with representative XXXX, he takes down my information and looks into my case. He eventually tells me the case isn't in my favor and that the transaction was completed due to authorization even though I called a week earlier telling them I did not authorize it. I explain to the gentlemen what happened and he says there is nothing the bank will do about the situation. Stating regulations and laws that protect the bank, he claims no fraud was committed but I should have my phone checked because it could have been hacked! And if I have nothing else to say then he has completed his call with me. Tells me sorry for the loss of money."

Wells Fargo I responded : I have no idea what you are referring to. I did not state I was traveling in XXXX. None of what you referred to was in the email I sent you. 
I received a wire transfer from the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX in Yen. There was no ATM involved. There was no travel to XXXX. There was no purchase made. I was told by my branch manager in XXXX XXXXXXXX there would only be a {$15.00} wire transfer fee to receive money from the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 
No other fees were mentioned. 

They responded by giving me a case # XXXX and saying they would look into it. And they would get back to me in 10 days. 
XX/XX/XXXX Called Foreign Currency Department XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX in XXXX XXXX. 
I spoke with XXXX XXXX about the rate of exchange. 
We spoke for over 30 minutes about how Wells Fargo deals with converting yen to dollars.

He told me various scenarios of how the bank puts the yen I received with other orders of yen to amass large amounts and then converts them.

I spent over 30 minutes asking XXXX XXXX what rules Wells Fargo has to adhere to when deciding when during a day of, ( his words ), "" wildly fluctuating exchange rates, '' which they would use. Obviously, for me they used the largest Yen to dollar rate and I lost {$16000.00}. 
I questioned him to relate to me what rules Wells Fargo has to adhere to about when and at what rate my yen gets converted. 
He told me that the amount of yen I received was small. I said I disagreed. 
XXXX XXXX said my amount transferred wasnt high enough to warrant a better rate. 
He said that day XX/XX/XXXX the rate fluctuated wildly from XXXX Yen per dollar to XXXX Yen per dollar. I obviously got the high Yen to Dollar rate to benefit Wells Fargo. 
He began to tell me when the amount in question was between {$100000.00} - {$500000.00}, that wasnt enough to warrant a better rate. 
I told him he was incorrect. He tried to repeat himself and then said he was wrong. The amount was close to {$800000.00} if the lowest yen to dollar amount was used for that day when the transfer was complete. 

I thanked XXXX XXXX for his help and said that I was unsatisfied with the explanation and with Wells Fargo Bank and wished I had never used them in this transaction. I said that my confidence in their treatment of my account was severely changed and that doing future business with them was impacted negatively. I added that I hoped a manager or boss of XXXX XXXX would review my complaint. 
He said they would. 
The whole conversation was recorded. 


XX/XX/XXXX Wrote a secure email to Wells Fargo saying that the difference between what $ were deposited in my account and the conversion rate for that day was over {$16000.00} I said I had lost faith in Wells Fargo to deal fairly and wanted answers. 

Here is the email : Reference # XXXX. I have not heard back from you concerning my wire transfer from the XXXX XXXX  XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative who responded to my original email request for an explanation of the conversion of yen to U.S dollars gave atartlingly incorrect and lengthy explanation of traveling and purchasing items in XXXX and the fees involved. I have no faith in Wells Fargo to have handle my simple wire transfer ethically and with a mind to keeping my business. 
The rate of exchange for that day was XXXX yen to {$1.00}. XXXX Yen/ {$1.00} XXXX Yen = {$800000.00} On my Wells Fargo account the conversion is only for {$780000.00}. The difference is {$16000.00}. Wells Fargo charged me a huge amount of money for something. You either charged me for a purchase I did not make, a use of funds in a manner that did not happen, fees that were not disclosed to me or a far worse conversion rate of yen to dollars. 

I need a response.

Wells Fargo XX/XX/XXXX I Called the Federal Reserve to register a complaint about Wells Fargo Bank Spoke with XXXX # XXXX Went to online Wells Fargo Account and searched for terms and agreements-NO search results, told to go to link for our public website. 
I searched the website of Wells Fargo online for Account Terms and Agreements and got NO search results. There is nothing for me to have informed myself about how Wells Fargo receives a foreign currency or when or how it is converted into U.S. dollars. NO information on whether I need to be contacted with the rate that will apply NO asking me for permission to do so, NO rules that need to be complied with for Wells Fargo. 
I logged onto XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I understand your concerns regarding your recent incoming wire transfer. I am grateful that you brought this matter to our attention.

I logged onto XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 


I researched XX/XX/XXXX for the conversion rate on several sites. 
Web search indicates on XX/XX/XXXX an exchange rate of XXXX Yen/ {$1.00} XXXX Yen = {$800000.00} On my Wells Fargo account the conversion is only for {$780000.00}. 

That is a difference of {$16000.00} that I did NOT get because XXXX Yen per $! was used. 
XXXX Yen / {$1.00} XXXX Yen = XXXX I want to lodge a formal complaint starting with Wells Fargo Bank officials. 
I think they used the worst possible conversion rate on that day and somehow covered up the real transaction amount by compiling my funds with other funds, converting them for more U.S. dollars and then hiding the actual transfer in paperwork I am not privy to. The amount they gave me in my account was the worst possible rate fro that day and they profited on my Yen transfer because no one is keeping tabs on their movement of funds and conversions. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed that I did not want to receive a phone call from the executive office but wanted a response in writing. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX,  I received a letter from Wells Fargo : Dated XX/XX/XXXX Case Reference XXXX Transaction Amount {$780000.00} Work of Date XX/XX/XXXX Our records show Wells Fargo received XXXX XXXX Yen at the current exchange rate of XXXX resulting in a credit to your account for {$780000.00}. For any further assistance please contact directly our Foreign Exchange Wire services at XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.

I searched the Wells Fargo Website on my online account for any information on wire transfer regulations and found nothing. I searched for the general terms and agreements on my account and found nothing. I searched for terms and agreements on currency conversions and found nothing. There is no way I could have understood the conditions of receiving the Yen into my bank account. The manager of the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXXXXXX branch did not direct me to read any terms and conditions. I informed her of the upcoming wire transfer in Yen and all she told me was that it would be a {$15.00} fee no matter how much Yen was transferred. I asked if the bank performed any special tasks to receive the funds and she said no that the bank received millions of large transfers daily and that there was nothing special for me to do or know. 
Wells Fargo did not inform me of the conversion rate before they applied it. 
They are known for fraudulently setting up accounts in people 's names that did not request those accounts. Now, I believe they make fraudulent conversions of foreign wire transfers and mix up the paper trail to cover their manuevers. 
Thank you for helping me."

The caller explained that someone was hacking her account and attempting to transfer all of our funds from the account using XXXX. The caller said that if I did not transfer money through XXXX back to myself then all of our money would be taken. After I transferred {$1000.00} over the caller hung up. Immediately realizing my mistake I called Wells Fargo customer service and reported the fraud. After waiting XXXX weeks for a response I reached back out to Wells Fargo customer service. When I talked with them they belittled me and said I should be more responsible with my finances. When I asked them if they knew about this scam they told me yes. I asked why Wells Fargo would not find this pertinent information to pass on to customers as a warning. They had no answer. Later on we received a letter in the mail denying the fraud claim and stating that they found the event in question to be an authorized transaction despite the fact we have had the account over XXXX years and have never used XXXX before. To add to this, XXXX weeks prior my Wells Fargo account was frauded and over {$300.00} in charges and was reviewed and reversed with Wells Fargo issuing a new debit card to me. Then after this incident my Wells Fargo credit card was frauded for {$300.00} yet again.

1724,On XX/XX/2018 my husband and I were interested in purshasing some XXXX XXXX concert tickets so we could bring our daughter to the concert. So we went to XXXX and found 3 tickets that seemed reasonable priced. We communicated with the seller and they explained that they could not attend because their daughters got in trouble and that they were not going to reward the daughters and were just interested in selling the concert tickets. So they said they were about 3 hours away from us and asked us if we would be willing to send the money through XXXX and we said no that is way too risky and we got scammed using XXXX so they said would we be willing to send the money using XXXX through our bank of Wells Fargo. And we thought well surely if anything went wrong our bank would protect us. So we sent the {$160.00} to this person and they were suppose to send us the concert tickets via transfer using XXXX. Well they never came and we tried contacting the seller afterward and they never responded again. So we went to our bank and they said sorry because we willingly sent to the money hat there was nothing they could do.

I don't know who this XXXX XXXX person is and have never heard of him, this is a very cruel and vicious act he has done to me. I immediately called Wells Fargo Fraud department and asked them to stop this transfer and the representative was very nasty to me and told me to go in the branch and verify my identity and I asked to be transferred to a manager or supervisor and she hung up on me, I was begging her to stop this, and it is on the recorded call from Wells Fargo, had she stopped this transfer this could have been prevented. I even told the representative to look at my account history I would never deplete my account and send someone my entire savings, this is clearly FRAUD. I have always trusted Wells Fargo due to previously when I have traveled, they have called and verified activity on my bank card and ask me if I was traveling, they have always been very thorough with detecting suspicious activity. I have been a customer with Wells Fargo for 23 years and nothing has never happened to me like this before. The Fraud Department tried to do a recall from XXXX XXXX, but they stated the money was gone and there was nothing to recoup. I have been saving that money for the last 6 years to purchase a home and I am devastated. That transfer cleaned my account out, they even took my job check that was deposited on that Friday, I can't pay my bills nor buy any food. I really need someone to help me because I don't know what I am going to do and help me get my money back.

1729,"On XX/XX/XXXX I came to the Wells Fargo branch at XXXX XXXX  to wire the funds for a real state closing to the XXXX XXXX. The XXXX of the branch XXXX XXXX processed the wire, however there was not process to verify that the wire instructions were legitimate. Few hours later I was contacted by the closing attorney who advised they didn't receive the funds, immediately we found out the wire instructions were sent from a hacked email. I contacted the manager of the Wells Fargo bank to place a stop payment, so she did and I got a claim number. The same night I verified and the funds were still on my account the day after XXXX  the funds left my account around XXXX XXXX. I contacted the Wells Fargo wire fraud department and I was informed the swift recall was not placed with the right procedure so the bank had to re-file a swift recall again but this time following the Correct process, the wire fraud representative mentioned the Wells fargo branch didn't reach the proper department and for that the funds were released from my account. On Monday XX/XX/XXXX my mother the second owner of the account visited the branch since I was out of the country due to work, and the Manager of the branch Mrs XXXX confirmed with the XXXX XXXX  after many calls and following many security protocols that the funds were frozen at the XXXX XXXX with a flag due to name discrepancy, Mrs XXXX advised my mother that the money would be recurved. After I returned back to USA on XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Wells Fargo wire fraud to the investigator Mrs XXXX, she mentioned the XXXX XXXX  did not t replied to the swift recovery yet. on XX/XX/XXXX I received a partial refund deposited into my account. After filing all the complaints with the police, FBI, and all consumer agencies, the XXXX  informed me on XX/XX/XXXX that they could only recovered what I was credited because the Wells Fargo did not informed the XXXX on time and the fraudester had time to withdraw {$32000.00}. The Wells Fargo was negligent by now stopping and freezing the money on my account immediately at the moment the fraud was found, also if the information released by the Wells Fargo manager was not accurate or there is a lose part on the chain that the wells fargo needs to investigate and determine and protect my rights as customer and victim of a crime. The wells Fargo did not followed up with the XXXX to make sure the funds were kept safe and frozen as the Manager was initially informed by the XXXX XXXX employee. 

The chase banks faults Wells Fargo for taking very long to reach, but I demand the refund of the {$32000.00} stolen. The culpability of either bank should be handle among the banks, not using me as a victim. 

The fraud alert whomever made the mistake, should not revert on my detriment. I am a customer of the wells fargo and the fraud alert should've stop the funds from leaving my account immediately and not allowing the money to leave 48 hours after.

1730,"Hello, On Monday XX/XX/XXXX, my employer-sponsored 401k account ( via WellsFargo ) was compromised when an unknown individual called in ( posing as me ) and successfully transacted a {$18000.00} loan ( sent to his bank account, via ACH ). Attached is a full timeline of events as I know them. 

My plan is called : XXXX Dollars & Sense 401k ( via Wells Fargo ). 

On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed suspicious activity on my Wells account when I received a notification saying my login information had changed. This is when I called in, inquired about what was happening, and discovered that the loan was taken out days prior. 

I opened a case with Wells ( XXXX ), with their Retirement Services Fraud team. They are mailing me some type of "" fraud packet '' to my home address, which I need to sign + return to them so they can initiate the investigation. 

HERE 'S THE THING : I also received a letter from USPS ( dated XX/XX/XXXX, which I discovered and read this morning ). It was a confirmation that my "" mail forwarding request '' had been successful. So ... the person who stole my identity is also receiving my mail. Which will make it challenging to comply with Wells Fargo 's policy ... of opening this fraud case. 

Tomorrow ( Monday XX/XX/XXXX ), I'll be contacting USPS to clarify the mail theft issue. I'll also be sitting down with a detective at my local police station to go over everything that I know. I will also contact Wells Fargo letting them know about my USPS mail issue ... and see if they can send the fraud packet to a local branch.

I certainly do not have the "" warm and fuzzies '' from Wells Fargo on this matter ... and I'm hoping the CFPB can assist me in securing my account + resolving this matter.

Thank you very much!

1734,"Wells Fargo Bank - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX PA. XXXX. US Beginning on the XXXX XX/XX/2019, a series of payments was instructed from my Wells Fargo bank account, in the total amount USD XXXX to scam XXXX XXXX / XXXX  / XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX. 
They prevented from me withdrawing my funds when I demanded such. They did not invest my money, but just stole it. I submitted a recall dispute to Wells Fargo Bank on XXXX XX/XX/2019. The transaction that made through XXXX XXXX have been made without my consent. The fraudster XXXX bought Digital Currency through XXXX XXXX purportedly on my behalf using my computer via XXXX XXXX   ( a Remote-Control App ). As they are professional con-artists they managed the whole scenario deliberately with no intention of actually investing my money but to stole it. They used my email address for registration and my online banking. So as the accounts on XXXX XXXX were opened without my awareness. 
Wells Fargo gave his final response on XXXX XX/XX/2019 and declined my request on grounds that The signature on file for your account appears to match the signature on the item ( s ). We are not able to verify that fraud occurred. 
When I authorized the payments by my account, I did not know that the merchants are scams, I discovered it later on. In my dispute, I asked Wells Fargo to take the responsibility and asked for a refund, because no services or investments were supplied to me by the scam merchants. Wells Fargo gave his final response on XXXX XX/XX/2019 and declined my request on grounds that The signature on file for your account appears to match the signature on the item ( s ). We are not able to verify that fraud occurred. 
Yes, XXXX made me sign some documents and statements to make it all look legit, however, the fail applying their own terms and conditions which they created by themselves. 
XXXX were giving me a fake platform, fake details, and by not applying their own terms and conditions I find it fake to. Therefore, I can only surmise that the documents and statements I signed were also fake, and can not hold or be any evidence of my claim. It is like I would sign I'm authorizing to steal from me, stealing it's illegal and even if I signed a fake paper, doesn't make it right. 
As of now I am aware that this kind of "" investments '' called XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX trading is illegal in the US, yet Wells Fargo permitted the instruction of these payments. 
What is egregious is that I have since found out that there were numerous warnings issued by few regulators, warning the banking community against allowing the instruction of payments to these particular merchants : XXXX How is it that Wells Fargo approved the transactions in the first place and didn't protect me, as their customer? 
Would Wells Fargo Bank approve a payment to money laundering XXXX ( terror organization ), if they established a website branded as an investment service? XXXX is either an illegal scam, or an investment service. It can not be both."
1735,I had made wire transfer of {$1500.00} on XX/XX/2018 to XXXX XXXX through wells Fargo bank XXXX XXXX branch. wells Fargo bank has guided the rule that IBAN number should be used instead of account number. the banker who did the wire was unaware of that and she used account number instead of IBAN. After that the Wells Fargo team self generated the IBAN number without my consent and credited the amount to generated IBAN. And IBAN created by them is XXXX and which is NOT CORRECT different from my beneficiary IBAN # XXXX. Now they are calming that we credited the fund to the right account. It's impossible to have 2 IBAN # for one account. My beneficiary is still calming that he has not received the fund yet. Now wells Fargo bank is saying that its the beneficiary and the consumer 's problem. They are saying that wire department is not taking responsibilities for the mistake made by them.I have been continuously making contact with Branch manager and the bankers involved in this case. But they are saying that I should provide the proof that my beneficiary has not got fund. If they had already credited the amount to wrong account number how can my beneficiary gets the money. I have no where to go from here and i would greatly appreciate any help from your part. I am the sole provider for my family as my dad just underwent XXXX XXXXXXXX and I that money was loan repayment for my dad 's load.

1738,"To whom it may concern, My name is XXXX XXXX, a customer of Wells Fargo since XX/XX/XXXX. I first would like to say I hope you are having a great day but I am upset because of the inconsistent advertisement of XXXX being able to transfer money in minutes. I have been using XXXX with Wells Fargo over the past couple years. Recently, I have been receiving a payment transfer from one of my clients who also bank with Wells Fargo. This client has had the same issue I am about to explain. On XX/XX/XXXX, I used XXXX to transfer {$860.00} to my XXXX XXXX account. Earlier that same week, I transferred money with minutes on three separate occasions. On XX/XX/XXXX, when I transferred the {$860.00}, I have still not received my money into my XXXX XXXX   account yet. I have called both banks and they told me I chose to receive my money later instead of now. Well, I knew that was a lie because when you use the app with Wells Fargo, it only allows you to send money in minutes. It does not allow to change any delivery options. I have attached those screens shots to this email to give visual of what I am explaining. Even if I chose to receive my money the next day, it should have been in the account days ago regardless of the holiday on Monday. Wells Fargo was open Saturday, Tuesday and today. I believe today Wells Fargo released the money to be sent to my bank by it has offset my account with a - {$350.00} ( XXXX XXXX ) in fees. I'm currently at - {$470.00}. I should not have been at that amount because this is a service that is advertised to take minutes at most the next day. I never go online to send money or change any settings so the money would be transferred at a slower rate. This is very poor busy practice or a procedure that needs to be looked into because after doing research online, I have found others who have experienced the same issue. Just to reiterate, I transferred {$200.00}, {$19.00}, and {$5.00} all in the same week within minutes. All I'm asking is for the right thing to be done because I should not have a negative balance. I try hard to manage a positive account and stay away from overdraft fees. I currently work for XXXX XXXX and have my payroll going to Wells Fargo every two weeks. My father banks with Wells Fargo, had his mortgage with Wells Fargo, and has loans with Wells Fargo. I want to continue to use Wells Fargo but I can't under these circumstances. There's more I need to explain but I don't want to make this email any longer. I thank you for your understanding and look forward to hearing back about this issue. I also have attached photos to this email. The above reference is what I wrote to them last week. As of now, I have paid over {$730.00} in overdraft fees related to the XXXX payment that was not delivered when it was supposed to. The basis is I have spoken with Wells Fargo corporate, bank, and phone support. I get different answers about this situation and they all seem not to really know what the app does or how XXXX works completely. I have reached out to XXXX and they have explained to me that most transactions are within minutes and at most within 1-2 days. Wells Fargo transactions take about 3-4+ days on amounts of $ XXXX even though Well Fargo advertises I can send up to {$2500.00} in one day through XXXX in minutes and {$10000.00} in a month."
1739,"On XX/XX/2019 I sent {$300.00} to a person named XXXX XXXX for some concert tickets. Shortly after sending the money I asked this person about the tickets and never got a response. I followed up multiple times and was unable to get a response.

1742,"I recently tried making a purchase through a private individual who offered me to adopt a puppy. Many texts, pictures, videos, and even phone calls were exchanged so this person went above and beyond to make me feel safe and secure. He even told me he was a XXXX and a family man so that he would never ever be able to do something so cruel as to scam me. In order to make a more secure transaction after thinking it was connected to a bank account, we ended up using XXXX as a form of exchanging currency. In order to use XXXX I went ahead and logged on to my mobile banking app and went ahead with the exchange. A couple of hours later and after multiple attempts to reach out to this person, I contacted Wells Fargo to see if this could be cancelled or if anything could be done. I filed a claim, contacted them again the next morning, and after waiting for about 2 hours to be helped Wells Fargo told me there was nothing they could do since it was with a private seller. I offered to provide any type of proof or documentation I had including pictures and screen shots but they said they wouldnt even start an investigation. My XXXX transaction ended up totaling {$500.00} and the other transaction made through XXXX to the same seller was of {$350.00}. XXXX however didnt even provide a customer support option. There was absolutely no way of even speaking to someone who can tell me they would even try. Its extremely heart breaking to see how someone can be so cruel to trick others like this, but its even more heartening to know that a bank Ive been with for almost my entire life wouldnt even help me or provide support with something so unfamiliar and cruel such as this."

We went to local law and enforcement and file an official complain but after few weeks they found our money transferred from one account to another within Wells Fargo but eventually withdrawn the money by saying Loss Prevention Closing Entry ( screenshot attached ). It seems money is still with Wells Fargo and need your immediate assistance to release these funds back to us ( originator ). I would appreciate your attention to this matter. Thanks XXXX"

I am a resident of Nc. The checks were cashed for the full amount on 2 days back to back. The checks were from a XXXX account that did not exist. The only form of ID requested was my account number. The amount of the 2 checks was over XXXX. When the checks bounced the choose, they chose not to call me, but to send me a letter. In the letter, they said that since funds were not available in the checking account, they took the money from my money market. I filed paper work 10 days later and the amount was refunded. 
At that time, I was told that a teller at the branch cashed both checks. There was no attempt to verify the identity of the person. All that was presented was the bogus checks with the account number on the back of the check. My funds were returned based on my signature. 
I filed a police report with the XXXX County Sheriff 's Office. 

It has been 11 months and WF has repeatedly denied my requests for further information to file restraining orders against the individual. 
I have been told that since I was reimbursed by the FDIC I am no longer a victim. WF is the victim because they assumed the debt. Another letter, claimed that WF is too busy to verify every persons ID that presents a check to a teller.

I have moved my accounts from WF. The WF service representatives in Nc have told me the branch in XXXX violated standard operating procedure and there is no way that that amount of cash should have been dispursed without a managers signature. 

My current bankers feels that it was an inside job involving at least 3 people ... the fraudster, the teller and a manager. I have been unable to find an indication that this crime was ever investigated. I have filed an official complaint with the OCC, FBI and the XX/XX/XXXX."

However, after I transferred the money ( XXXX dollars ) through my Wells Fargo App via XXXX, I never heard from the individual again. I promptly contacted Wells Fargo within minutes after the transaction to cancel and warn them of the scam. I provided them with his phone number, email, XXXX account, XXXX post and other bank accounts he is using for the transactions. I told them that the XXXX posting is still active as well as the email and phone number because he responded to my friend who had just reached out about the tickets again. I was told "" thank you very much for all of this information, and that an investigation would be opened and that I would likely receive my money back given that this is a scam. '' However, my money was not reimbursed and no additional steps were taken y the bank to prevent this person from scamming other individuals ... even though the bank was provided with information to help shut down this scam. I reported this posting to XXXX as a scam as well. I tried reaching out to XXXX however they would not help me because I used XXXX through Wells Fargo and therefore have to issue my complaints with Wells Fargo."
1752,"Our company 's email account was hacked in XX/XX/2019. The hacker sent emails to our customer stating that our bank account number had changed. Our customer issued due payments against our invoices ( i.e. {$83000.00} & {$11000.00} ) to the fraud account by electronic funds transfer unknowing that these payments were issued to a fraud account. The fraud account was also an account with our bank, i.e. Wells Fargo Bank N.A. 

Wells Fargo Bank N.A. accepted the electronic funds transfer despite a complete disconnect between the beneficiary name and beneficiary account number. As the fraud account as well as our company 's accounts are Well Fargo Bank N.A.  accounts, Wells Fargo Bank N.A. knew that no person had rights as a beneficiary and acceptance of the subject electronic funds transfers can not occur. 

I have included herewith email correspondence along with corresponding document exchanges with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. requesting feedback on this error on their part. They are standing firm that beneficiary account name and beneficiary account numbers are not verified prior to wire acceptance. I believe this is willful negligence on part of the bank. Furthermore, I have repetitively requested Wells Fargo Bank N.A. to provide their Incoming Wire Security Procedure & Policy, but have been denied access even though our company is their customer. I believe this is willful deceit by the bank. 

Would appreciate if Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can review this issue and provide guidance in the matter."

They closed the case on XX/XX/22 saying there is nothing they can do for us, that it is up to the banking institution my son sent the money to refund us for this transaction. 

This is the same bank ( Wells Fargo ) who actively promotes the use of XXXX on their website and encourages it's customers to use the XXXX product!

1761,"On XX/XX/2020, I initiated a wire transfer from my small business to a company in XXXX in the amount of {$5600.00} from XXXX  XXXX  account at Wells Fargo bank in Minnesota. The XXXX company I was paying provided XXXX information for both the destination bank (  XXXX  XXXX XXXX )  and their intermediary in the US ( XXXX, now known as Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX ) as well as account information for the XXXX  XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the intended recipient called to confirm that I had in fact sent the transfer because he had not seen the funds arrive. I contacted Wells Fargo. They informed me there was a problem with the transaction and that it was being cancelled. They said my funds would come back to me and that I should expect to see those funds back in my account in 7-10 business days. I was unable to initiate a new wire transfer to the vendor via Wells Fargo ( I tried to get on the phone with a rep so they could ensure I was entering the information absolutely correctly but she had difficulty understanding the support I needed and my call was cut off ), so I set up an account with a service called XXXX and sent the payment out that day. That transaction was completed and arrived at the destination within 24-48 hours. On XX/XX/XXXX, the {$5600.00} from the original wire transfer had not yet arrived back in my account. I contacted Wells Fargo. The first CSR I spoke to told me that the wire transfer was, in fact, completed and that the recipient should have the funds. I reached out to the XXXX vendor and was told they had NOT received the original wire transfer, only the funds sent via XXXX. I called back in to Wells Fargo and the second CSR I spoke to did some additional digging and came back to tell me that the wire transfer had gotten "" stuck '' at Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX which is technically a separate entity from my domestic Wells Fargo. The wire transfer division was closed for the night, but she recommended I talk to someone the following day in that specific group to get more information about what was going on. I called back on XX/XX/2020. I was told that the two banks have been communicating via the XXXX  XXXX. Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX says that the wire transfer can not be completed with the information provided and to please share additional details about the recipient ( account number, etc. ) in order to process the transfer. Then MY bank responds that it wishes to cancel the transaction and have the funds sent back, please confirm. From what I have been told, this exchange has been repeated multiple times since XX/XX/XXXX when the transfer was initially rejected. Each bank makes the exact same statement ( we need more info, please send the funds back ) and nothing actually happens. Meanwhile, my {$5600.00} is being held in limbo. The CSR suggested I speak to my banker to try to escalate the issue and get resolution. I made an appt. and went in to my local branch on XX/XX/2020. The banker attempted to reach out to the wire transfer division but was told essentially the same information - that the banks could only communicate via XXXX, that Wells Fargo could not "" make '' Wells Fargo NA XXXX do anything, but could only wait for Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX to recognize that it was being asked to send the funds back. I was - perhaps mistakenly - given the email address for the investigator assigned to my case. I emailed her on XX/XX/2020 and received no reply. I called in again on XX/XX/2020 and was told that there had been one more round of the same communication between the two banks, but otherwise, nothing had progressed. It is now XX/XX/2020, almost a month since I initiated the wire transfer and almost two weeks since I was told the funds should have been back in my account. I have tried as many things as I can to escalate this and reach resolution. I have no way as a consumer to reach Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX to push this along, and Wells Fargo claims they can not reach out to them any way other than via XXXX, which has been unsuccessful to date. I worry that this infinite loop could go on for months without resolution - and, in the meantime, I'm out {$5600.00} of working capital at a time when a small business needs all the cash flow it can muster. I don't mind if it takes 10 more days, I just need assurance that Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX recognizes that it is being asked to return the funds and puts that process in motion. I have a wire transfer # and an investigation case # I can provide."
1762,"This complaint is about Wells Fargo Bank. 

I have attempted twice now to send a domestic wire transfer from my Wells Fargo account. I followed the bank 's instructions, but they cancelled my transaction within 24 hours with no prior notice and without explanation as to why. I was notified of the cancellation by email replicated to the bank 's online message center. I replied to the email only to get a response telling me to reply through the message center. However, when I went online to the Wells Fargo Message Center, the email function reply had been disabled. In fact, there was no way to contact them in writing at all.

Only after more than 2 hours on the phone with the bank ( being shuttled between various departments as well as being cut off twice and having to restart the phone call each time ) I was told the transfer had been flagged for fraud. But Wells Fargo had made NO attempt to contact me to verify if the transaction was legitimate before cancelling it. Every other financial institution I deal with has a system in place for quickly verifying with customers whether they recognize a specific transaction. 

At the bank 's instruction I resubmitted the same transfer online. However, the fraud specialist who recommended this course of action also stated he did not know the reason the transaction had been flagged and could not guarantee it wouldn't happen again. So this time, I tried to head off any issue by calling the bank a few hours after resubmitting the transfer, only to be told it had AGAIN been flagged for fraud. Then I was told I had to wait for a callback from their fraud department sometime in the next two days (! ), and that they could not tell me when they would call, even though I explained that I could not take personal calls during working hours. I then spent another hour and a half on the phone with them before finally being escalated to a manager who could release my money.

While on the Wells Fargo site, I investigated their "" security center '' to see if there was any way to inform them that my transaction was legitimate. There was not. All of their online options for security alerts allowed consumers to report suspected fraud, but there were NO options to allow consumers to verify that a transaction was legitimate.

My complaint therefore has two parts : 1 ) Wells Fargo ( unlike other financial institutions ) has no system in place to quickly verify with the consumer whether or not a specific transaction is genuine. 
2 ) Wells Fargo has made it impossible for an online consumer to contact them in writing to verify a transaction or even to get an explanation about why a transaction was declined. ( I suspect this is intentional ; it leaves no paper trail and also leaves the consumer at the mercy of their so-called "" customer service '' phone system, which in my experience functions more as a maze to cut off unwelcome conversations and prevent consumers from reaching anyone with authority. )"

Initially I reported the incident to my local Police Department to file a police report. I had contacted both Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX about the incident and they had mentioned there is nothing they can do because it was a Peer to Peer transaction. I also contacted my U.S. representative and there is nothing they could do. 

After the additional CFPB guidance was released in XX/XX/2021 about XXXX platform transactions and after finding out about it today, I reached back out to Wells Fargo and XXXX. Both institutions are pointing to each other saying neither are liable. XXXXXXXX XXXX said since its linked to my Wells Fargo debit card they are not liable.

While on hold for 52 minutes, I was unable to logon to online banking, my online credentials were changed without authorization and the money was transferred out of my account. I had no way to stop the process and once my call was finally answered, I was told it was too late for the bank to stop the transfer."

I went into a Wells Fargo branch on XX/XX/ to file a complaint ( # XXXX  ) regarding this issue, as I was told I could not appeal the decision. I was then contacted by a complaint representative who looked into the claim denial more and was told that the transactions occurred from fingerprint access to my phone.

She told me that you need to drive to IRS branch in XXXX to clear your debt and pay your fines in advance via a wire transfer and when you get to IRS office they will give you a reimbursement check and all charges against you will be dropped. I was very scared and as an XXXX   I felt very vulnerable and wanted to clear my name on the records since I had not done anything wrong and I was worried that this might jeopardize my new job and embarrass me in front of my boss. 

Under pressure, first I paid {$9800.00} via wire transfer at a Wellsfargo bank near my work place in XXXX XXXX TX to the account number the scammer sent to me which was a XXXX XXXX XXXX branch in XXXX Florida. They also made me buy {$9700.00} money order from my Wellsfargo debit card and mail them to an address in Florida via XXXX. 

After I realized that it was a scam a few hours later, I immediately contacted Wellsfargo customer service and notified them about these two frauds and filed a police report. I asked Wellsfargo to freeze my account and reverse the wire transfer and submitted a claim for the other {$9700.00} transaction. At that time, money was still in my account and the transaction was pending. Telephone customer service told me that we can not do anything about it and you must show up at your local branch and ask them to take care of it. I told them, in this case the timing matters and if I wait until tomorrow morning to go the branch that might be too late. But they did not do anything. Luckily, I stopped the money order by contacting XXXX  and they immediately stopped the delivery and resend the envelope back to me. However, I could not do anything about the wire transaction. 

In the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, just after the Wellsfargo branch in XXXX XXXX TX opened I showed up and asked them to send an alert about this activity and shared the police report and the contact info of the officer working with me on this case. They told me that we created an alert and it should stop the transaction because most of wire transactions take 24 hours or more and I had a few hours to stop it. After checking with my bank again in the afternoon, they told me that the alert was sent out around XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX but I did not hear back from the Wellsfargo and at that time transaction was completed and money collected by the scammers to my surprise! I called the wire transfer department of Wellsfargo on XX/XX/XXXX hours after the incident and they checked the status of my alert and notified me that it was just sent out a few minutes ago on XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX XXXX! I was furious and asked them why it took so long to stop this transaction and why you misinformed my bank. They told me that we address the alerts in the order in which it was received, and they blamed me for not taking care of my account and I am responsible for loosing my money! I was traumatized and received no sympathy or immediate action from Wellsfargo.

Id like to submit a complaint against Wellsfargo for not taking immediate action on freezing my account and giving false information to the customer and the local branch and their attitude toward a traumatized and disturbed victim. Wellsfargo did not do anything on the debit card transaction either and again blamed me for my carelessness. I lost {$9800.00} because Wellsfargo carelessly took care of the situation and delayed sending the freeze alert to the receiver bank. I also feel very embarrassed and shameful for being so vulnerable and my life, my judgment, and my work has been affected by this incident greatly. I believe Wellsfargo must take responsibility and compensate me for their careless actions."
1778,"I had posted a XXXX XXXX and equipment for sale on XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2022 for a total of {$3500.00}. I had a person by the name of XXXX XXXX message me on XXXX messenger stating he was interested. He stated that he would like to buy the camera and would send me money thru XXXX ( which I have never used before and I saw it on my Wells Fargo App so I thought it was a trusted site ). I received a fake email ( at the time did not know how XXXX worked and the email I had received looked very professional ), stating that I had a pending amount and would just have to ship out my camera and verify tracking number then the amount would deposit into my account, the money never came. I then received another email from XXXX stating that because of the amount of money, the buyer of my camera would have to send me an extra {$800.00} to open up a business account, so the buyer and I agreed that he would send {$800.00} extra ( which I received another email stating that the money was pending, I would just have to then send the {$800.00} back to a XXXX XXXX, and the money would be deposited into my account ). So I initiated the transfer of {$800.00} to the buyer on XX/XX/2022. And the money never came into my account. I received another email stating that I would have to send another {$500.00}. At this point, I now realized that I was being scammed. I called XXXX, explained my situation. They stated that it was a fake email, this was a scam, but there was nothing they could do but report the account I had sent money to. I called my Wells Fargo Security and explained what was going on and I filed a dispute right away. The Wells Fargo rep stated that I should have no problem getting my {$800.00} back. I waited 10 days for the claim to be processed, and I got a letter stating that there was nothing they could do about the {$800.00} I had sent. I called back again to Wells Fargo and reopened my dispute and told them I had filed a police report and everything. I told them that XXXX had reported the account that I had sent money to and that account is now unregistered with XXXX. I just received another letter from Wells Fargo stating that because I authorized the transaction, there is nothing they can do. For a company that I have been with for 10+ years, I feel as if they should help me out. I would have never authorized the transaction, had I known I was getting scammed. So now not only am I out {$800.00}. I also shipped my XXXX  and equipment that I was selling for {$3500.00} with no possible way of getting that back. Please help me out."
1780,"I provided computer consulting services for six people via the Internet. I was paid for my time and expertise with XXXX. 

To confirm that the customer was authorized to use the XXXX payment method, I requested a photo of their ATM debit card. This card 's name matches the XXXX name. 
Only the legitimate owner of an account would have the ATM debit card and online XXXX access. 
There is no chance that a thief or phisher could hold both the physical card and online access. 
The only conclusion is that the customer is fraudulently filing a chargeback. 

If there is a chance of someone stealing a debit card and then getting XXXX access, that is the negligent fault of the bank and the bank should bear the cost of the fraud due to poor security. 
Please restore the funds to my Wells Fargo account : 1. XXXX XXXX = {$990.00} ( Wells Fargo Customer ) 2. XXXX XXXX = {$500.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX Customer ) 3.

1781,"Hi, On XX/XX/2022 someone hacked my Wells Fargo accounts, transferred all the money from personal checking to my business checking and then wired everything out of the business checking. I filed a claim within 24 hours of it happening but then got a letter from the bank saying my claim was denied. I called to file an appeal, they said they won't reopen the case because they don't have strong evidence that it was fraud, when I ask what I need to provide as evidence they said nothing because the claim is closed."
1782,"On XX/XX/21, I received a text from what I believed to be Wells Fargo Bank. It stated that there was an attempted XXXX transfer of {$3500.00}, & asked me did I approve this transaction. I replied "" NO. '' Later that day I received a call from what I thought was Wells Fargo ( per the caller ID ). The caller said he was with Wells Fargo, referred to the above-mentioned transaction, & told me that in order to reverse this transaction, I had to go into my account online & follow his instructions. I went into my account, & he then had me : 1 ) set up an account in my name with XXXX XXXX & 2 ) XXXX transfer {$1000.00} from my savings account to this new XXXX account. He also talked me through setting up a wire transfer of {$1400.00} from my checking account ; I was later able to cancel this transaction. He then told me not to log in to my account for XXXX hours. When the call ended, I was suspicious & I called Wells Fargo & was connected to the Fraud Dept. They informed me that this is a current scam, & it was unlikely that I woud get my money back because XXXX is a cash transaction. They did open up a claim, # XXXX. I received a letter from Wells Fargo today, with their final determination, & then called them. I was told that this scam was not considered fraud & I woud not be reimbursed. I am a retiree on a fixed monthly income, & needed that {$1000.00} to pay bills. I"
1784,"My complaint is that I made a transaction from my bank to my landlord bank through a system used by the bank called sure pay, which is Wells Fargo to XXXX XXXX. However, this is where my problems began because the landlord claims that he never received the money and he also showed me proof that he never received the money. I made three claims to Wells Fargo Bank in order to retrieve my money back ; but it was not successful. Also, I am on a fix income and losing that amount of money has put a hardship on my finance. This is the reason why I am seeking help from CFPB at this point."
1787,"I received a check in my name for {$840.00} issued to me for a reimbursement of money. I wanted the cash and also wanted to avoid charges at my bank especially if the check bounced for any reason. So instead of depositing the check at my bank, Saturday XXXX XXXX, 2017, around noon I went to the bank branch stated on the face of the check : WELLS FARGO XXXX XXXX Branch XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, FL, XXXX. Phone : XXXX. I presented the check for payment to the teller ( a XXXX XXXX ). As requested I stamped my fingerprint on the check ( XXXX XXXX provides the ink but nothing to clean it with ), gave teller two photo IDs ( US passport and FL drivers license ), which teller reviewed, approved, and proceeded to counting money. At that point he asks if I 'm a customer of Wells Fargo, I answer no, and he informs me there is a {$7.00} fee for cashing the check. I demanded several times to be paid in full the amount stated on the face of the check which I believe is their obligation. He refused several times and later bank manager came and also refused several times stating it was bank policy. I said I was being ripped off as they were not doing what the check instructs them to do "" Pay to the order of ... the amount of {$840.00} ''. Not minus {$750.00}. Simply, they were refusing to pay the full amount thus not honoring the check. Then a third bank employee, a women much taller and larger than me, came up from behind and began verbally harassing me in a loud menacing tone. I asked the bank manager who this person was, she answered just an employee and pushed the check and my IDs back at me. All this while the employee kept behind me more and more loudly almost shouting to the back of my head. Then a fourth women employee standing several feet away started to call at me and a fifth employee, a man in an office behind me stood up and came to his office door. At that point I felt threatened as I saw no other customers in the branch except me. I did not raise my voice or make undue threats, only demanded bank do what check says. I asked if I could take a photo and record their negative with my cellphone. They said I should put cellphone away because it was against the law and I did as told. I asked if their was a policeman around. The woman standing behind me rudely said no but that she would call the police in a menacing tone. I was shaken and decided to leave, harassed, feeling afraid and angry, and without cashing the check. I felt I should lodge a report with the police and may still do so for the bullying but also believe this bank 's practices of charging for doing exactly what they are supposed to do and likely charge their customers for is outrageous. If this is an accepted practice then from now on one should demand checks be issued with the plus amount of whatever the bank charges for cashing the check. This sounds impractical if not impossible, which all the more makes me believe the bank acts improperly not honoring the check drawn against them. Please tell me what are my rights?"
1790,"I received a direct XXXX message from a family member asking to send a XXXX as she ran out of availability for the day. As we were talking personal things a few minutes before thru XXXX I did not think much of it, and sent {$520.00}. Minutes later I found out that she had been hacked and called my bank immediately. They failed to give me any information on the matter and I had to find the case was closed with little investigation by calling them."
1791,"I received a call from Wells Fargos customer service line from someone impersonating a teller. I was told that someone was attempting to access my account and transfer {$8000.00}, which I didnt have. The teller told me that because the transfer was through an app called XXXX they couldnt stop it but they could help me save my money. All I needed to do was transfer the money, using XXXX, to Wells Fargo for holding. I was told that sending the entirety of my account would make it impossible for the person attempting to clean out my account to get any money and Wells Fargo would return my balance to my account in XXXX hours except it wasnt a Wells Fargo teller it was a scammer who duplicated Wells Fargos customer service number to gain my trust and completely empties my bank account. I lost all my saving that day. I immediately called Wells Fargo and reported this, they gave me a conditional credit for all the money I lost while they investigated. I just found out today that the credit I was given is being revoked as Wells Fargo determined that it was my fault I was scammed and is not at fault for someone impersonating their likeness and using a third party app to steal all my money."
1792,I called these people over and over for the last 10 months about my issues logging in not only that the fact that they've given me new accounts I can't even access my self my XXXX is always being changed by someone else 's money withdrawn sent to other people in other places my XXXX cards paying people 's business bills and there bills and I can't get XXXX done I need to know if I need an attorney because this has completely humiliated me abosolutley have shamed and embarrded me publicly and tormented me to be done this way
1793,"It's been about 19 months ago that my wallet had gotten stolen and immediately contacted Wells Fargo customer service for help and explained the situation and they said they would do an investigation and they contacted me weeks later, stating that they could replace the funds. Again I explained that my wallet was stolen with all my information in it, and they apologized. Better never refunded money. Then about 8 months later they called and asked would I like to refile a claim. At that point I was frustrated and declined the offer. Also the account was closed due to lost funds."
1795,"HI I sent a international wire transfer of {$10000.00} from wells fargo i paid {$30.00} as a contract service for wells fargo to send the money into euros. After a month of hearing nothing i recieved a credit of {$9200.00}!! I then recieved a letter saying "" due to extraordinary circumstances although the wire transfer was sent correctly without error but had to be returned '' They said due to currency fluctuation and charges i received charges and costs of {$730.00}!!!!! I called straight away and demanded a full refund and explanation. 

The next letter i recieved said missing account information!!!!! So i emailed and called continually asking what specific account information is missing?? They declined to answer stating they dont know. I have wasted hours of my life debating and trying to hget my money back i paid for a service that wells fargo did not complete i want them to specifcally say what account information is missing. This would contradict there letter stating that all info was correct and wire sent succsesfully. This means wells fargo have not asked for all the information needed to make a succesful wire transfer as all online forms were complete and correct. I need to send multiple transfers to the same bank account what happens on the next wire transfer.I will not let this go Wells fargo should know what missing account details were missing its a online system that was correct you can not procedd if not correct and wells fargo admitted in writing it was correct so why change the story on the second letter. This incriminates them also as if wells fargo as the big financial institution they are did not request all the info then there service failed a paid service a contract i entered when buying there service of {$30.00} to transfer money. I am demmanding a exact explanation the description of the exact info missing as all was sent there is something really suspicious about this and i will not rest. Also food for thought if the currency exchange went in my favour are they saying they would of returned {$10000.00} if the fluxation went in my favour. Casing point if i transfer more money tommorow with all the correct details this transfer has been made many times before what will happen"

At some point they were distracted and I was then able to turn off my phone and when I turned my phone back on, I immediately uninstalled the application the used to remote control my phone. They tried calling me back numerous times then I blocked the number. At the end of this ordeal they had purchased XXXX of XXXX XXXX via my XXXX account and sent it to their personal wallet.

The first was for {$1.00} at XXXX and the second was for {$250.00} at XXXX I saw the emails about two hours after they were sent and immediately called Wells Fargo to report the fraud and was walked through the process of locking down my account - changing my username and password, some other security measures for phone identification, etc. I was told the fraud case would be opened and I would have my money back in a maximum of 10 business days.

7 business days later I called them to get an update and was told that it was still being investigated, but that I would still have the money back in my account within the 10 business days.

12 business days from when I filed the complaint, I received a letter from Wells Fargo ( with a date of XX/XX/XXXX - two days BEFORE I called for an update and was told it was still being investigated ) telling me my claim was DENIED with them and that they are saying that I authorized the fraudulent transactions."

That money was transferred from my joint account ( XXXX ) on XXXX for {$2000.00} to my personal account ( XXXX ) as its been done for years on a payday scale ( every 2 weeks ) and the money was now being placed on hold. This causes a major hardship as this money as always has been used in covering bills The banker advised that it was being reported as fraud. I advised that there has absolutely been no fraud on either account and that all moneys were authorized. I requested that the history of these accounts and the history of it being done this way be taken into consideration and the funds be released as not to cause hardship. I was read a statement saying that I would be liable for this {$2000.00} which I express my objection to as this has been the norm for these accounts, also that no fraud was committed and I confirmed that as normal all transfers were authorized."
1808,"I fell for an XXXX scam. The guy convinced me to use XXXX ( which I had never heard of ). When I saw that XXXX was actually integral to my Wells Fargo phone app, I assumed it was legitimate and safe. 


I sent the {$220.00} to the guy, allegedly named XXXX XXXX. "" XXXX '' denies receiving the payment and punctuated his denial with an accusation of my "" attempted scam ''. He was very smooth, patient, kind until he got the money -- then the fangs suddenly appeared. There is a long communication between us recorded in XXXXXXXX XXXX "" messages ''. XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX user name is "" XXXX '' The Wells Fargo / XXXX app confirmed the {$220.00} was sent ( unable to get a screenshot ). Wells Fargo /XXXX does not provide any kind of transaction number. It just says "" Payment sent to XXXX XXXX {$220.00} '' nothing more. "" XXXX XXXX '' XXXX ID is XXXX I called Wells Fargo and they were unsympathetic, basically telling me I was out of luck. They should be able to verify that the money was received by the payee 's bank, which, combined with the XXXX messages would show that "" XXXX '' defrauded me. 
The closest thing I have to documentation is this from my Wells Fargo statement : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX TO XXXX XXXX ON XX/XX/XXXX REF #  XXXX {$220.00} The XXXX item number is XXXX. After getting my money, he immediately re-listed the item with the same sob story to hook more fish.

There is no evidence that they have provided to back up the fact that they insist we withdrew the money. 
I will be happy to provide more detailed information if it is requested."
1811,Wells Fargo continues to mask it's responsibility for protecting its clients behind a third party company they own. They XXXX their responsibility to me their customer and offer no help. I will be moving my accounts to anyone else other than a bank that doesn't follow the law and protects its customers.
1812,"I sent money to a seller for a wallet XXXX $ on XX/XX/2019. I was scammed no further connection with the seller, requested my money back from seller it was declined and never heard from since. I sent it through XXXX which I use through Wells Fargo. I contacted Wells fargo on XX/XX/2019 they gave me the run around and told me it is XXXX problem. I than contacted XXXX on XX/XX/2019 and they cancelled the sellers account but can not refund me my money due to it's the banks job as they just process the transaction and do not take it from are bank accounts."
1813,"On XX/XX/2019 Wells Fargo Bank issued two wire transfers from our checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, {$500.00} per transaction, for a total of {$1000.00} without our permission. We do not bank with Wells Fargo and have not had any type of active account with Wells Fargo for approximately two or more years. 

We discovered the illegal withdrawal of funds from our account on Sunday, XX/XX/2019 and contacted a local branch of Wells Fargo by phone on Monday. Wells Fargo Banking personnel had two responses to our claim : 1 ) How did they ( Wells Fargo Bank ) take money out of our account when we don't bank with them or have and type of account with them? 2 ) There was nothing they can do about the illegal transfer, and we had to contact our bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and make them find a solution to the problem. 

Both responses by Wells Fargo personnel were reprehensible! First Wells Fargo Bank steals XXXX from us and then tell us there was nothing they could do about it, and we should go find someone else to deal with it. 

Fortunately for us we found out about the stolen funds in time for our bank, XXXX   XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, to rectify the problem before any checks we wrote bounced due to insufficient funds. Due to the efforts of our wonderful personnel at the credit union, they were able to retrieve the {$1000.00} from Wells Fargo before we were hit with penalties for insufficient funds. 

I am upset that Wells Fargo Bank did absolutely nothing to rectify the problem. Was this truly a mistake by Wells Fargo our did they purposely try to steal our money for whatever reason? How many other people have experienced similar thefts by Wells Fargo Bank. I hope a government agency fines Wells Fargo for their illegal act or at the very least penalizes them for their incompetent act of taking money out of our personal account without proper cause or permission."
1814,"I was victim of scam, deceit and fraud in several transactions which are part of a larger fraudulent scheme to misappropriate funds from me. There are several matters I wanted to address in the investigation of the fraudulently endorsed check referenced above. 
Beginning on or about XX/XX/2020 I began a relationship with Mr. XXXX XXXX. 
there are two corporations which were used to further the fraud scheme.

As noted, two corporations were used to further the scheme. One of the corporations was directly involved in this particular transaction, XXXX, XXXX which was used as a secondary entity through which funds were laundered and used for the personal benefit of XXXX XXXX. I have included corporate documents downloaded from the Secretary of States office. 
I direct you to the Domestic Stock Statement officially filed on XX/XX/2020, with a corporate ID number of XXXX. You will notice in the box denoting Officers of the corporation, I am listed as the following : Chief Executive Officer ; Secretary ; and, Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, I am listed as sole Director as well as Agent for Service of Process. It wasnt until we recently secured this document that I discovered, I held the noted offices as well as being the only director of the corporation. On paper, I ran the corporation exclusively, although I was neither asked, nor did I give permission to XXXX XXXX to attach My name in any context to the corporation. XXXX XXXX appointed me to the seat of authority not to aid the direction of the corporation but to ensure I appeared as the sole responsible figurehead in the event the corporation incurred any liabilities. ( In a transaction unrelated to this transaction, XXXX, XXXX was involved in a {$110000.00} purchase of a XXXX Motorcar orchestrated by Mr. XXXX XXXX. I was totally oblivious to my name included on the corporate documents and had no involvement with the company. My inclusion in the corporate documents was merely to create falsified information As stated above, I was not in a formal relationship with XXXX until XX/XX/2020. Within nine days, XXXX had already implemented the beginnings of his plan. The Domestic Stock Statement is dated XX/XX/2020. Allowing for filing turnaround time, this document had to be in the Secretary of States filing system within hours of the beginning of their relationship, on XX/XX/XXXX. The importance of XX/XX/XXXX, will soon be made evident. 
XXXX later convinced me to loan him money which was to be paid back with the monies he claimed he held in XXXX. One of the loan checks written was in the amount of {$68000.00}, the subject cashiers check. Despite me wanting to make the check out to XXXX personally, he had me make the check to XXXX, XXXX We have attached a copy of the check, front and back. The payor is XXXX Bank. 
CFPB Page 2 of 2 The check is dated XX/XX/2020, the same date the Domestic Stock Statement was filed with the Secretary of State, unbeknownst to me XXXX XXXX. The funds were drawn against XXXX XXXX and were payable to XXXX, XXXX. In speaking to your representative XXXX XXXX has expressed a concern with how the check was endorsed. XXXX has returned the check and has served a subpoena against Wells Fargo Bank for relevant documents. 
Despite the check being made payable to a corporation, the check is endorsed as an individual and not on behalf of the named corporate entity, by someone with authority as is required under California law. Moreover, given that myself XXXX XXXX named as every officer and sole director, I would be the only individual capable of authorizing any endorsement of the cashiers check. 
Consequently, without any authorization from me XXXX XXXX, this is a fraudulent endorsement perpetrated by XXXX XXXX, notwithstanding the check wasnt endorsed as required by California law on behalf of the corporate entity. 
The information provided is squarely relevant to this analysis and shows beyond the fraudulent endorsed check, the larger scheme to defraud me XXXX XXXX XXXX who is likewise trying to defraud. 

I look forward to hearing back from you. 

Sincerely,"
1817,"I needed to transfer money from XXXX XXXX, XXXX MS to Wells Fargo. I had to add XXXX XXXX to my Wells Fargo account as an authorized bank. I followed all of Wells Fargo bank-to-bank transfer validation procedures to add XXXX XXXX. I received notification that XXXX XXXX was added to Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo stated the maximum amount that could be transferred was {$5000.00}. I made the transfer transaction through Wells Fargo and received an email on XX/XX/19 from Wells Fargo stating that my transfer was being processed ( see attached email ). The next day, XX/XX/19, I received an email ( see attached ) from Wells Fargo Security Fraud that unusual activity was seen in my Wells Fargo account and my account was locked. I contacted Wells Fargo Security Fraud and they stated even though I followed the correct procedures to transfer money, that is how fraud starts. They directed me to go into a Wells Fargo branch and show them my XXXX XXXX statement and identification to prove that the XXXX XXXX was truly my account. I did what Wells Fargo wanted me to do and my account was unlocked. On XX/XX/19, it became apparent to me that my {$5000.00} transfer had never been applied to my Wells Fargo account. I have called Wells Fargo everyday this week, spoke to numerous Wells Fargo employees about my missing money. They created an investigative case number XXXX. A XXXX XXXX employee made a 3-way call with me to Wells Fargo to attempt to resolve the missing money. Wells Fargo has stated when Wells Fargo Security Fraud froze my account that the transfer transaction was cancelled and the money was returned to XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX   was able to contact Wells Fargo ACH department and obtained a trace number for the credit from XXXX XXXX  associated with a debit to Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo ACH department was unable to locate a trace number for a credit going back to XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX  employee tried to explain to the investigative case workers at Wells Fargo that since an off-setting credit trace number was not available in their ACH files, the money was probably in their unposted funds account. Wells Fargo is very adamant that the money was sent back to XXXX XXXX but could not provide any trace numbers to prove that fact. XXXX XXXX  has searched their ACH files to ensure nothing was missed on their end. My money has not been in either account for over a month and is nowhere to be found. During my final conversation on XX/XX/19 with Wells Fargo executive investigative department, I informed them I would be filing a complaint with the CFPB and they said "" OK ''. It appears to me they do not care about my missing {$5000.00}. I firmly believe when the Wells Fargo Security Fraud department froze my account, the money was cancelled from being put into my Wells Fargo account and it was not transferred back to XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX agrees with my belief that my money is somewhere within the Wells Fargo financial institution."
1818,I purchased an item through a seller and paid {$1000.00} in two separate transactions of {$500.00}. I sent the money through XXXX and the person disappeared and never sent my product. I tried to cancel the payment with XXXX and also filed a claim with WellsFargo. I am a XXXX so losing $ XXXX in a scam is very hurtful. Even more hurtful is how unwilling my bank is to help in this situation.
1821,"Hello, I filed a claim to Wellsfargo for fraud because I paid for a service and did not receive the service.

1822,"On XX/XX/2021 I was a victim of a XXXX scam. I first received text messages from ( XXXX ) XXXX indicating, "" Wells Fargo Fraud Dept : Did you attempt ... '' There were three ( 3 ) messages reading the same. Aftering replying, "" NO '', I received a telephone call from an individual on my mobile telephone number. The individual presented themself as a Wells Fargo Representative from the Fraud Department. They then had me login to my Wells Fargo banking account and walked me through several steps to transfer money using XXXX. They explained that I needed to transfer the money to cover the overage from the attempted charges in the text messages. 

1 ). Wells Fargo does not consider my case/claim to be fraud and insist it is because, I "" authorized '' the transfer. 

2 ). Wells Fargo is violating my rights as a consumer afforded me under Regulation E and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. 

3 ). Wells Fargo is not adhering to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's own determination and definition for an "" unauthorized electronic fund transfer '' which can be found on page 12 of the CFPB Electronic Fund Transfers FAQs dated XX/XX/2021 ; and reads as follows : QUESTION 5 : A third party fraudulently induces a consumer into sharing account access information that is used to initiate an EFT from the consumers account. Does the transfer meet Regulation Es definition of an unauthorized EFT? 

ANSWER ( XXXX XX/XX/2021 ) : Yes. As discussed in Electronic Fund Transfers Error Resolution : Unauthorized Fund Transfers Question XXXX, Regulation E defines an unauthorized EFT as an EFT from a consumers account initiated by a person other than the consumer without actual authority to initiate the transfer and from which the consumer receives no benefit. 12 CFR XXXX ( m ). Comment XXXX ( m ) -3 explains further that an unauthorized EFT includes a transfer initiated by a person who obtained the access device from the consumer through fraud or robbery. Similarly, when a consumer is fraudulently induced into sharing account access information with a third party, and a third party uses that information to make an EFT from the consumers account, the transfer is an unauthorized EFT under Regulation E. 
For example, the Bureau is aware of the following situations where a third party has fraudulently obtained a consumers account access information, and thus, are considered unauthorized EFTs under Regulation E : ( 1 ) a third-party calling the consumer and pretending to be a representative f rom the consumers financial institution and then tricking the consumer into providing their account login information, texted account confirmation code, debit card number, or other information that could be used to initiate an EFT out of the consumers account, and ( 2 ) a third party using phishing or other methods to gain access to a consumers computer and observe the consumer entering account login information. 

EFTs stemming from these situations meet the Regulation E definition of unauthorized EFTs. 


THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AND WELLS FARGO WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS INFORMATION. THE WILL NOT ADDRESS OR RESPOND TO MY REQUESTS FOR WELLS FARGO TO FOLLOW THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU 'S POSITION."
1823,"Wells Fargo has an icon listed on page with my accounts once I am logged into my online banking. It is called XXXX XXXX. At the time I had no idea this wasn't actually Wells Fargo because it is actually listed on my personal account page. Why would they have another company user tool listed with my personal checking account information?? I assumed it was how we transferred money and it was in fact Wells Fargo. Well on XX/XX/2018 We thought we were buying tickets to a football game and we transferred the seller {$500.00} through our Wells Fargo account. Come to find out it was a scam and someone had made up all of their information and they took our money. The seller said their name was XXXX XXXX and listed an email address as well. But come to find out, that person doesn't really exists and they scammed us. Wells Fargo acknowledges, after reviewing that person name and email that it's all red flags that they show and things didn't match up ( we would have no way of knowing that from our end ) BUT they refuse to give us our money back. Banks are suppose to protect their clients. We have ALL of our money and 401K and IRA with them and all they are saying is that this is not fraud but it is in fact fraud. This was a made up name and person that committed fraud and Wells Fargo is treating us like we are the criminals instead of the victims. Please help! We just want Wells Fargo to do the right thing and give us our money back. They should never posted XXXX with our account information if it is not actually Wells Fargo. We didn't go to XXXX to do this transfer, we actually logged into our Wells Fargo online banking portal and XXXX is just listed under our checking account. We didn't even know this wasn't a Wells Fargo tool until this happened and Wells refused to help us. This is so misleading and unethical on so many levels. We feel so violated and vulnerable that our bank, who we believed to be a trusted partner, would allow this to happen to us. If they will not protect you from this kind of thing thing they 100 % should not have XXXX listed in our personal customer portal. We just need help getting our money back and no one will listen."

On the statement date of XX/XX/XXXX states XXXX XXXX from XXXX, and sold the loan by Wells Fargo. Then on XX/XX/XXXX charge XXXX XXXX Charge Number XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo filed foreclosure. On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo alleges that the loan was paid off. On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo suddenly dismisses the lawsuit which is the second foreclosure lawsuit Wells Fargo has dismissed on the home since XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX A payoff statement was ordered from alleged to be XXXX  XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo sends a letter to me in XX/XX/XXXX stating congratulations the loan was paid off with a release of mortgage. Wells Fargo has never disclosed how the loan was paid off or why the Foreclosure was dismissed. I had an attorney at the time who I was paying a monthly bill to help me save my home. I thought all the loans on the home were paid off after my wife passed away on XX/XX/XXXX through the probate of a wrongful death. However, a XXXX Home Equity line of Credit was taken out in XX/XX/XXXX. My Last payment was in XXXX with the real mortgage company XXXX before they closed in XXXX. Out of nowhere a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX alleges to have received assignment from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX which is about 6 years after my last payment. XXXX  XXXX XXXX was calling me asking me to send documents regarding a previous loan with XXXX which I did not understand why. 
On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX filed a foreclosure on the home without my knowledge or being served in any lawsuit. Wells Fargo filed a foreclosure XX/XX/XXXX. When I found about it the foreclosure with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX it was XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX stated to have no record of the home or involvement with XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. It appears that XXXX  XXXX XXXX using the name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX as a decoy to hide XXXX XXXX XXXX from any involvement or liability with the foreclosure lawsuit. In the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, I also discovered that documents were forged in my name as if I made appearances in court when I was working at the VA at the time. Then I hired an attorney on XX/XX/XXXX after that and not sure what happened next until now. 
Wells Fargo Alleged to have sold the loan in XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo claims it was paid off on XX/XX/XXXX it can not be both. XXXX XXXX XXXX is alleging that it paid off the loan from Wells Fargo. When it was alleged to already been sold off. XXXX XXXX XXXX instead alleged to have consolidated the loan to avoid Wells Fargo foreclosure on the home that would have wiped any second liens on the title. I dont believe any loan was actually paid off to Wells Fargo XXXX Wells Fargo or XXXX XXXX XXXX is refusing to produce any payment information or wire transfer as to who, when, why or where this alleged payment was made. Now XXXX XXXX XXXX is claiming that it alleged to have paid off the loan, and added Wells Fargo loan to the old XXXX loan. I never knew anything about this at all. I have never signed anything or applied for any, new loans, refinance, loan modifications, Deed, in lieu, forbearance or reverse mortgage, confirming consolidating anything with XXXX  XXXX XXXX. Nor have I applied for loans above with any other lenders regarding the home. XXXX  XXXX XXXX claims to have been paying extra home insurance on the home, Taxes, Wells Fargo transferred loan adding taxes to this amount. The amount Im alleged to owe with XXXX XXXX XXXX is over XXXX on a home that is under water and worth less than XXXX. This is fraud, because I did not do any of this. Im being harassed by XXXX XXXX XXXX for money that I do not rightfully owe. I also recently discovered that Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX removed my name on the loan documents, and placed my former attorneys name to receive my loan billing statements. In the end my attorney claims to not know anything. Then later my former Attorney stated that he thinks XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX paid it off. I was never informed by my former attorneys that anything was paid off for me to have to pay it later with another lender, or servicer. Wells Fargo had me sign a loan Modification that originated by XXXX XXXX XXXX  VA loan that I had on the home in XXXX. The loan was alleged to be acquired by Wells Fargo in XXXX. However, this can not be confirmed. Because XXXX XXXX XXXX  Received Government Assistance Failed on XX/XX/XXXX. The loan was created in XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. VA secured loan. In XXXX Wells Fargo pressured me to sign a loan Modification changing those terms of the original loan from a VA loan to a regular Mortgage without informing me of that. XXXX, XXXX also did not get any approval from the VA to change the terms of the loan which was higher well above my income amount. Which now have me in the situation XXXX in today. Then soon after the loan Modification was completed a Bank called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX filed a foreclosure less than 30 days later after alleged to have signed a subordination agreement with Wells Fargo. 
Now Im in a process to be evicted from my home by alleged to be XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is using the name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to Evict me from my home. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX also allege that I owe over XXXX to them that I know nothing about as well. I feel I have been a victim of XXXX XXXX abuse, consumer fraud and fair debt collections act practices and mortgage foreclosure scam by hired law firm. It does appear that XXXX  XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo were working together as this is connected with the National Mortgage Settlement ( XXXX ). Wells Fargo filed the first foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Illinois XXXX XXXX. I was also informed that the alleged judgment by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is invalid. The Eviction case on the home is XXXX. However, the eviction case was dismissed in XX/XX/XXXX. Whomever is working with alleged XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is still trying to pursue the Eviction case despite being dismissed for want to prosecute on XX/XX/XXXX. The Eviction case was not refiled within XXXX year or vacated. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is Threatened to sue me for debt not owed. I also have reason to believe that additional lawsuits have been filed against me By XXXX XXXX XXXX or Alleged XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX that Im not aware of. Nor was I served by anyone regarding any new lawsuits. Seeking assistance with this matter. Wells Fargo filed a foreclosure XX/XX/XXXX. I hired an attorney in XX/XX/XXXX after that and not sure what happened next until now. Wells Fargo Alleged to have sold the loan in XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo claims it was paid off on XX/XX/XXXX it can not be both. 
This XXXX  XXXX XXXX statement says that I made payments when I have not made any of these payments to XXXX  XXXX XXXX. I feel that someone took out a loan in my name and identity with XXXX XXXX XXXX for me to pay it back later which is fraud. Im also a victim of identity theft as well since XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX - This a document that was Submitted to the XXXX with false claims that the home was vacant. When the home was not Vacant to have me restricted from accessing the home and my property removed from the home. Despite a wrongfully filed Eviction case against the home during the Illinois Eviction moratorium in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Who is really XXXX XXXX XXXX? 
XXXX XXXX has been harassing us at the home and her husband for years. I have proof that she has been disparaging us with random people while claiming to be the realtor of the bank. Then she seems to not be sure what bank she is alleged to be working with. But have uploaded old outdated documents from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. The Vacancy document has XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX on it as well. This is wire transfer fraud scam that wired money to my former attorney for a settlement that I did not receive any money from. This is not about the false statements by Wells Fargo claiming the loan was paid off. The loan was forgiven for wrongdoing by Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo is working with XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX as well. The amount that was alleged to be paid to Wells Fargo from XXXX  XXXX XXXX are totally different payment amounts. XXXX  XXXX XXXX has XXXX amount and Wells Fargo has another amount which is clearly fraud. Any payoff amount has to contain the exact same amount paid out and received. However, XXXX XXXX XXXX wants me to pay them back money that was never paid to Wells Fargo loan. Nor did I confirm anything for XXXX  XXXX XXXX to pay off any Wells Fargo loan. Please look at the loan documents with my Former attorney 's mailing address on my statement for him to receive my pay statement only that I had no prior knowledge of. Nor did I authorize this with Wells Fargo or my former Attorney. 
A lawsuit was filed in Illinois against National Title Clearing Involving XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo deed came from alleged XXXX  XXXX  from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX name was involved as part of a robo-signing mill transferring loans fraudulently. The FDIC records show that XXXX  XXXX was acquired by XXXX not Wells Fargo. I have the proof and documents of all allegations. Wells Fargo dismissed both foreclosure actions were due to wrong doing not the loan being paid off. Now in XX/XX/XXXX the stories change that XXXX XXXX XXXX paid off the loan to Wells Fargo which is false. 
Now XXXX  XXXX XXXX wants me to pay back a loan alleged to have been paid off to Wells Fargo. I did not authorize any payoff or loans or anything with XXXX  XXXX XXXX which is fraud. Please review document attachments. I'm consulting with attorneys regarding fraudulent activity... Wells Fargo continues to not answer or supply accurate information to my complaints filed. Please submit all responses to the lawsuit upload documents for review to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to conceal fraud /Elder abuse. Wells Fargo also forged my name on documents as well. The make home Affordable document from Wells Fargo is forged and not my signature. Please review the Making Home Affordable document page XXXX that the Monthly gross wages are scratched out, and the income expenses are incorrect. Not my hand writing. This is a fraudulent created document. 
I never signed any court affidavit or any affidavit with Wells Fargo or any bank, confirming anyone third party or Attoney to be given access to any loan accounts documents. Wells Fargo never confirmed anything to me to release any account documents to anyone, any attorneys and so forth. I never signed any notarized affidavit with any attorneys as well. Wells Fargo refuses to take any accountability for there actions which was fraud against me plain and simple.

1850,"TO CFPB, AMERICAN BANKERS ASSOCIATION AND NATIONAL CREDIT UNSION ASSOCIATION FROM XXXX XXXX RE : COMPLAINT - INTERNATIONAL WIRE TRANSFER I. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) I contacted my XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX to send an international wire transfer to a bank in XXXX for the purpose of a down payment for the purchase of a second home. The amount was {$25000.00}. I was told by XXXX that this would not be a problem. They do them all the time. The funds would need to go through the Federal Reserve and would take 5 - 7 days. 

They did not tell me that my funds would have to go through an intermediary bank, Wells Fargo. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I began calling to find out if the funds had arrived at XXXX XXXX  in XXXX. I had provided XXXX with the necessary information that they requested. I was told at that time about the intermediary bank, but was told it was XXXX  XXXX XXXX. I later was told it was Wells Fargo. I called Member Services repeatedly from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX with no results that the money had arrived. I was checking with the builder in XXXX and their bank had not received the funds. I then demanded to speak to someone in international transactions and received a call back from that department. At this point I had spoken to seven ( 7 ) different people. I was becoming quite concerned about the transaction. 

The funds specialist tried to help me and gave me a copy of the Single Customer Transfer. A message was sent to Wells Fargo requesting the they check the status of the wire with the beneficiary bank.

II. Wells Fargo Bank ( WF ) On XX/XX/19 I was told that WF indicated that the beneficiary bank was requiring additional information. They asked for some odd information since the Developer, who was to receive the money, had been doing international developments for 15 years and used their bank. However, I called the developer and was given all of the requested information. They wanted : The full name of the company as some of the name were letters. 
The full address Their business registration numbers Their business activity Our relationship A detailed purpose of payment. 

Most of this information was already given to them when we did the wire. I find it odd that the beneficiary bank needed this information since this is a long standing customer of their bank. 

On XX/XX/19 the additional information was given to WF by XXXX to be delivered to the beneficiary bank. 

On XX/XX/19 XXXX  asked that the transaction be escalated. I was under the impression that had already been done, but apparently not. 

At this time I asked to speak to management. 
On XX/XX/19 I wrote an email to a SVP  at XXXX asking for assistance to resolve this problem. At this point I was in violation of our signed home contract regarding the funds due date. She sent out a red alert to her counterparts. 

On XX/XX/19 I then heard from a Manager. He set up a conference call with the Director of Foreign Exchange Group with WF. I was told they would look into the matter. By this point I was extremely stressed and worried about where my money was and asked for a timeline. I kept in contact with our developer who told us the money was not at his bank. 

On XX/XX/19 I called to get an update and got the answer, We are working on it. 

On XX/XX/19 I called and got the same answer. 

I am now 2 days from this matter lasting one month. I have talked to the developer today and no funds have arrived at his bank. 

WHERE IS MY MONEY???? 

I need your assistance in finding out what has happened to my money. I will have to send the full payment for my home in XXXX or XXXX when it is complete which will be about {$150000.00}. I am absolutely terrified to do so with the poor service I have received from these two institutions. I am trying to figure out a way to get the funds there without having to deal with Wells Fargo. I have lost all trust and wonder if my money is being held up to get interest on it. WF says the money is in XXXX and XXXX says they have not received it. I do not understand why WF can not trace the wire transfer. Do they not get a receipt when the funds arrive to their destination? I am at a loss of what to do next. 

Please consider my issues and help me get some answers to clear up this mess.

1851,"I recently turned in a check for {$1100.00} to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX and was told I wouldnt be able to access the funds until XX/XX/XXXX. The reason being is because Im overdrafted, which doesnt make sense because the amount I deposited was more than enough to make my balance positive. This is highly inconvenient as I have bills and other expenses that are now going to be late because of this absurd policy."

I called the number from my land line thinking I was talking to Wells Fargo the whole time. The person had an XXXX accent. They told me they would have to check my account for suspicious activity. They got control of my cell phone and email by having me open XXXX XXXX  on my phone and authorizing access. Then gave me a "" Reference Number '' had me read it back to them. They wanted a picture of my debit card and driver 's license which I gave. They then had me take a selfie all while having control of my phone. They kept me on the phone for 45 minutes with control of my phone, email and text messages while saying they were fixing my account.

I then called Wells Fargo immediately, around XXXX. They had deducted 5 payments from my checking account, attached to my debit card ranging from {$1000.00} to {$1500.00}. All 5 payments were to XXXX. Wells Fargo immediately closed my checking account and transferred me to debit fraud department who canceled my debit card and submitted what I thought was a fraud report as an "" INQUIRY ''. But they posted all 5 payments 3 days later anyway for a total of {$6300.00}. I was able to check my emails and text messages after I spoke to Wells Fargo. The emails were order placements and "" authorized '' payment messages from XXXX. Also an email from XXXX of 2 declined payments. Several text messages were from Wells Fargo with authorized "" codes '' to release the funds to XXXX Wells Fargo denied my "" claim '' for my "" inquiry '' stating the transactions were authorized and not a mistake. This was not authorized by me because scammers stole my identity with my cell phone and email. Wells Fargo also told me they would send me replacement checks for my new account but after 10 days I called Wells Fargo customer service again and they were never mailed. So they reordered the checks and mailed them but charged me {$26.00}. They also asked me several security questions to verify it was me. XXXX of those included a name of a person whose first name I dont know XXXX "" XXXX '' ). It apparently is the daughter of my ex husband who I have had no contact in 23 years. She was born long after my contact with the ex husband. So of course I didnt "" pass '' the security part with that particular fraud customer service agent. Wells Fargo refuse to close an account opened fraudulently under my name with XXXX with my cell phone number and email.

1859,Long story short Wells Fargo closed my business account for the absolute wrong reasons.

1860,"XX/XX/2018 attempted contact Wells Fargo Bank by phone, spent hours in branch in XXXX, FL ; tried calling. Get hangups, transfers, mishandled ; no REAL attempt to fix issues : 1 ) Autopay since XX/XX/2018 is routinely paying bills late. Have had same billpay date since bank was XXXX and XXXX XXXX. Only since XX/XX/2018 are bills late.

2 ) They agreed to pay late fees, these have not been paid to date. AND the next month bills were also paid late.

3 ) Attempted to mobile deposit checks on XXXX-18. The site would not allow. One attempt I was told was accepted but not available until XXXX-18. Amount in that was wrong.

4 ) Available balance figure is incorrect as of early XXXX-18. Showed AVAILABILE balance with pending to savings transfer. Available balance should reflect pending transfers. Based on this I made purchases. Next I get email as to {$0.00} balance. I transfer {$500.00} immediately. Then I get overdraft fee hours later and I am told the {$500.00} is pending and not available! So now there is overdraft fee. AND I have no idea how much money I have available to buy food and medications! I can not know how much money is available as their actions are not timely.

Autopay scheduled mostly on XX/XX/XXXX of month. For YEARS!!! Payments going out very late in day, pacific time ; after close of business ( XXXX  ) often or later. They are not adjusted as to holidays or date entered when bill is due. Since XX/XX/2018. Sometimes payment going out on last day of month! I never know when bills are paid, when money coming out of accounts, when transfers are posted and available.

It is IMPOSSIBLE to know my account balance.

Wells Fargo will not accept this is an issue. They tell me I do not understand how to know my balance or use autopay. This is causing me fees, credit issues, problems with venders, financial distress, inability to buy basic food and medicine, overdraft fees, etc.

I have had bank accounts since age XXXX  and I am XXXX. I think I know how to use a bank account : I feel Wells Fargo is handling others money poorly. Attempts to fix are not working, takes hours, never happens.

I have health issues and I really can not god this unfixable problem. They pass from one person to another in phone. They drop calls. Going by branch is also ineffective.

Again, it is IMPOSSIBLE for ANYONE to know finds in their account and respond appropriately.

Autopay is supposed to be guaranteed. The email service is supposed to give timely updates on balances to avoid overdraft fees. The charges are coming out late and at all different times so one can not plan on them. Pending charges not in the AVAILABLE balance. Attempts to transfer funds are not timely so it is ineffective. It is a disaster since XX/XX/2018! And they take no ownership of the problems.

Mind you, it has only been like this since XX/XX/2018. So I guess I do not know how to use a bank account or go online banking and XX/XX/XXXX day bill pay date has ONLY been a problem since XX/XX/2018! Guess I lost my facilities in XX/XX/2018?

Doubt it. Wells Fargo is mishandling and providing untimely account information then benefitting from fees they charge."

COMPLAINT # XXXX TO THE CFPB From : XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I hasten to file this XXXX complaint on the advise of XXXX to whom I and my Father, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, spoke on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX, about our concerns about Complaint number XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX. 
Wells Fargo Bank, ( referred hereafter as the bank ) who is the subject of all XXXX complaints, did reply, as read to me by XXXX. My concern was and still is that the bank continues to insist that I or someone known to me withdrew the {$18000.00} from my accounts. I declared, with indisputable evidence, that I, XXXX XXXX did not authorize the withdrawals ; nor, that I know the person shown on the banks accounts as the responsible perpetrator. 
The latest banks response was communicated to me by one XXXX, with whom I personally communicated by telephone and fax, on or about XX/XX/XXXX. She only reiterated the fact that the case was closed by the bank. I explained that there is a dispute as per Regulation E of the Federal EFTA of 1976. So instead of presenting my stance to the legal department of the bank, she sent a fax number to which I could do so myself. But, this was a stonewall, because the fax number needed a code in order to connect. After not being able to hear from XXXX, I called the CFPB on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX, the answering agent. 
As I explained to XXXX, knowing that this is a legal matter, which falls under the rules of Regulation E, I have applied for a docket number from the docket Clerk of the CFPB as early as XX/XX/XXXX. Making this request, I hope to have the opportunity to provide the clear evidence that this situation between myself and the bank has created a dispute under Regulation E, of an unauthorized transfer of funds from a consumers bank account. I am sure that at a hearing before an Administrative Agency Tribunal of the OAA, an administrative judge would rule in my favor when comparing my evidence with that of the bank which has a record of consumer financial abuse. My wish is that the bank would facilitate the presentation of my evidence before an independent tribunal of the CFPB, the Federal Agency which has the responsibility of enforcing the rules of Regulation E.

My prayer is, that this complaint would cause a hearing to take place or bring about a settlement and recovery of the unauthorized transfer of the {$18000.00}.

1877,"Dear : cfpb departement I want to ask how do I get my tax refund and my fee payment to the bank? if i stagnate not able to continue my payment again requested by them? 

while my bank transfer funds can't be released because I can't forward payments to them anymore? is there a solution to advocate this XXXX? So i need your help to advocate my case with irs departement and wells fargo bank. 

it's too long the process. Because of my payment. because of my inability to continue the payment. this is what they use as an excuse to delay the process. 

in terms of what I could say otherwise, the delay in the process was because they were not committed and consistent with the agreement that we agreed and agreed to, before I made payments to them. and that I made so that they understand about my financial condition, and that's also why they have made a suggestion statement so that I try to find loans to other people such as banks, family and friends. so that after I complete the payment, this payment will be returned in full to me, so that I can return the loan to the bank, friends and family. 

in fact at this time I became a very heavy burden on my debts on their advice they too, because they themselves made the delay. 

This is why I ask for legal assistance to advocate for my problem and hope for a solution to this administration, so that my tax refund can be resolved and my tax refund and my transfer of funds will be sent to my XXXX XXXX account from Wells Fargo Bank. 

it's really hard for me to face this problem alone, at least my complaints can be heard by you and followed up with and learned from the case that I experienced against the irs department and wells fargo bank.

when you respond to this, at least it's really a pleasure for me to be broad in my thoughts and feelings for this TO : CFPB departemen I want to ask from my mind which is still hesitating to send my funds as a beneficiary : 1. the funds sent from my friend were {$3700.00} before, whereas the wells fargo bank said the funds were illegal and invalid from the output or issued from the wrong wells fargo bank department .???

2. and the legal one issued by wells fargo bank which is currently handled by him ( mr XXXX ) who has contacted me, the funds to be sent to my bank account are {$18.00} XXXX USD, so where did the money come from??? I was really afraid and unwilling to accept that it led to an illegal transaction so that I was arrested by the police, the money laundering, which could trap me in illegal money transactions and cause a legal case for myself. I want to confirm the source of funds, legal or illegal?

3. That my fund transfer which is currently handled by Wells Fargo Bank was ordered by President Joe Biden at the Presidential Office, is that true or not?

Do international fund transfers always get permission from the presidential office? I don't think so.

4. I am completely clueless about sending my funds from the US at this time, why is the process so complicated? Previously I had received a transfer from the US transfer to my account about 2 years ago from XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX not as complicated as it is now. And went straight into my cimb commerce bank account without any problem, and didn't pay even XXXX cent. Why does bank wells fargo now have to pay me as a beneficiary of the funds? 

I don't understand if this is business money or personal money, until now I don't know about that fund.???

5. By sending my funds as a beneficiary, I have made a tax payment to the irs department of XXXX $ and to Wells Fargo bank it is already XXXX XXXX what if I stagnate and go bankrupt and can't afford to pay taxes anymore? Can my tax payment be refunded immediately or not? For me the most important thing is that my tax payments to them can come back again. Because I can get money from loans from several parties at home and abroad to pay it off. 
below are some bitcoin addresses that I have made payments to : 6. I want to end everything for this matter, I feel offended by this sense of injustice, for their treatment. 

So I'm dizzy to deal with it how? Against the laws of the United States federal government. because even my friends in XXXX florida can't get this to the federal government of the united states. How am I? I don't understand more. This is very difficult for me. I have spent a lot of money but I have never seen the results. Which I can accept as a beneficiary.

7. Is all this real or not? I really need assistance in handling my case especially for CFPB management advocate and program analyst.

that the funds will be sent to my bank account in my own name : The attached sending bank documents that are currently being handled by the director of the Wells Fargo Bank international fund transfer center are : Due to the limited funds I have and my inability to send the payment they requested in processing my case, I request the Cfpb department for guidance and direction to facilitate and resolve this matter. And I am willing to provide the requested documents related to my case.

thank you.. and I am ready to provide the necessary data for justice in my case.

Thank you"

I called them the minute I realized I had been scammed and they said there was nothing they could do for me and that I was just out the { {$450.00} } I paid for a puppy I never received, AND the {$400.00} FRADUANTLY taken out of my savings account. WHEN a customer STATES they DID NOT do a transaction, RESPECT them when they say they didn't."
1893,"Today, XX/XX/2019 I used XXXX to buy XXXX XXXX tickets from a guy XXXX XXXX with email XXXX. As soon as I sent the money the phone call was disconnected. The phone number he was using was XXXX XXXX. I immediately called the fraud department at Wells Fargo ( my bank and his ) and they said sorry we cant do anything for you because XXXX  is a gift even though it was going from one Wells Fargo account to another. What good is it having a bank that doesn't back your transactions up? I felt safe with XXXX  only to find out there is no help with fraud! I don't make much money to begin with, and now I will have to work 3 days for free to make up the money stolen from me. I am just sick that there is no help from these banks. Someone please help. They make you jump through all these hoops and offer no help."
1895,"On XX/XX/XXXX { {$270.00} } was sent from my Wells Fargo account through XXXX to a person supposedly named XXXX XXXX email address was XXXX. Wells Fargo confirmed the transfer by sending confirmation code XXXX to my mobile phone. That transfer occurred about XXXX PST. The money was in exchange for 2 basketball tickets at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The tickets were promised to be sent to my XXXX Email Account, but never were. I spoke with Wells Fargo the same day and they said nothing could be done. They did not offer to identify the bank connected to the email. I spoke with customer service at XXXX to no avail ; they said it was Wells Fargo 's issue and would not identify the bank that was connected to the email account in their system. I also informed XXXX of the fraudulent advertising. Everyone passes the buck and scams like this perpetuate. Hopefully you can gets Wells to reimburse me for this complaint. Thank you."
1896,"I had initiated a XXXX transfer from my Wells Fargo account for {$400.00} to my husbands XXXX  XXXX XXXX account, my husband got an sms from XXXX  XXXX XXXX stating that the amount will be credited to his account along with a confirmation code, however the funds were not received by him into his account and the money was not refunded to my Wells Fargo account, although the statement shows that the money was deducted. 
While Wells Fargo filed a claim and then said the money should be with XXXX  XXXX XXXX , XXXX  XXXX XXXX is not ready to file a claim. 
We have been asked to go from One bank to Another with no one willing to give my hard earned money back. 

Please look into the same and help me get my money back."
1897,"Wells Fargo closed my account because of fraudulent activity in the year XXXX. 

I had a XXXX account opened afterwards and deposited money orders from XXXX. 
These money order added to the amount {$1500.00} and was never cleared into my XXXX  account and then had my XXXX account closed. 
I also never received any money orders or checks to claim my money because on top of the money orders deposited into XXXX they belonged to Wells Fargo Wells Fargo has my money that was wrongfully taken from me."
1898,"Good afternoon I have been told to pursue a new complaint against Wells Fargo.The owners of XXXX XXXX wrote me a check in XX/XX/XXXX. I deposited it electronically.

The XXXX can only respond about XXXX accounts. The XXXX is unable to address your inquiry about your insurance claim, as this pertains to an insurance product. The XXXX was notified that the appropriate party reviewed and responded to you about this matter. Our records show that on XX/XX/XXXX, a check in the amount of {$1300.00} was deposited into your checking account ending in XXXX via XXXX @ XXXX. The Remote Deposit Capture ( RDC ) Agreement states that Upon your receipt of a confirmation from XXXX that we have received the image of an item, you agree to prominently mark the item as Electronically Presented or VOID and to properly dispose of the item to ensure that it is not represented for payment.

1899,"I was under the impression I was paying for a new rental unit as I was trying to move out of my current renting situation and had to pay a {$500.00} security deposit to ensure that no one else took the place that we wanted to move into. So I sent {$400.00} ( XX/XX/2019 ) because my bank would only let me access {$400.00} out of the {$1000.00} checks that my boss gave me as a loan to help me move and the next day ( XX/XX/2019 ) I sent them the remaining {$100.00} I owed for the security deposit. After that I felt secure feeling that I would be able to move into this new place come the XXXX and then on that move-in day ( XX/XX/2019 ) I sent the first month rent another {$500.00} and after that was sent there was no further communication between the "" landlord '' and when we showed up to move into the new place somebody else answered the door saying that they had just moved into there the week prior and it was then that I realized I have been scammed so I immediately contacted my bank and filed claims of fraud on my account and on two different occasions sat down with them in person and went over these claims and was assured that I would get my money back but that I would have to be patient and wait for the investigation to take place through the online banking division after the 10 business days, I made a phone call to find out the status on my claims which they told me had been denied because of the terms and conditions I was only one at fault for falling for the scam and authorizing the money to be sent. I got forwarded from department to department until they finally sent to me to the case management team with a new case number to hopefully reopen investigation but upon calling today ( XX/XX/2019 ), I was forwarded to another department and left on hold for over 30 minutes until the call was dropped, so I proceeded to call a number provided by consumerfinances.gov which helped me find the numbers and steps I needed to take to hopefully get help with my crisis."
1903,"We wire-transferred US {$150000.00} on XX/XX/2019 from XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX via XXXX XXXX XXXX NY to Wells Fargo Bank NY for payment to our affiliated company in New York. 

We subsequently found that the wire-transfer was a fraud as our affiliated company in New York does not maintain any account with Wells Fargo Bank NY. We therefore instructed XXXX XXXX XXXX ( NY ) to stop the wire-transfer on XX/XX/2019 and obtain refund. 

Wells Fargo responded on XXXX XX/XX/2019 that it had reported the matter to its Fraud Department, but was unable to refund because there were no funds available. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sent another enquiry on XXXX XX/XX/2019 asking for more information. Wells Fargo further responded that payment of the subject international wire-transfer had been effected on XXXX XX/XX/2019 under its reference XXXX despite the name and account did not match. No funds remained and they closed file. 

We consider it the responsibility of Wells Fargo to match the name and account of the beneficiary before releasing the funds of the international wire-transfer. Wells Fargo is also responsible to refund the fraudulent payment to the remitter and to compensate the losses so incurred, because it had failed to act professionally to avoid paying the wrong party when handling international wire-transfer."
1904,"On Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX at about XXXX pm, I received an email from Wells Fargo that a wire transfer in the amount of {$22.00}, XXXX had been initiated on one of my Business Accounts. I immediately called Wells Fargo. I was on hold for XXXX minutes awaiting service due to "" unusually high call volumes ''. Once connected I asked for a fraud representative. I told the man, "" XXXX '' that I had not approved this wire transfer. He attempted to stop it as it was "" in progress ''. He thought he had stopped it but handed me off to a more senior level fraud person, "" XXXX '' who told me it was not in progress but had been completed. The fraud transaction was likely happening while I was on hold. I have never run a wire transfer out of this account, I only use it to hold funds, then transfer them to another account for wiring. I immediately filed a claim and they told me I would have to wait ten days for a decision. I received the decision today, XX/XX/XXXX, denying my claim and advising me that either I did the wire, or someone using my password and username did the transfer. Of course someone had my password and username, but their algorithms should have caught the transaction as it did not fit with my profile and was obvious fraud."
1905,"OnXX/XX/XXXX, I received an email to my company email address from our XXXX vendor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) changing their wire instructions to Wells Fargo bank , account # XXXX. Two wires were sent out : first onXX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$34000.00} and second on XX/XX/XXXXin the amount of {$40000.00}. Both wires were for the beneficiary of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed by XXXX XXXX that the wires had not been received. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, I was also informed by XXXX XXXX that their email system had been hacked. On XX/XX/XXXX, my bank files two wire transfer service request forms to return the funds due to the fraudulent account. The only response ( received XX/XX/XXXX ) received back from Wells Fargo so far is that there are no funds in the account to return."
1907,"I purchased a dog online. I was Issued a bill of sale for the dog. The price included the cost of shipping ( as stated in the bill of sale ). Now I am being asked for an additional {$600.00} for shipping. When asked for a refund, the seller disconnected the number and the email address is now showing invalid. 


An attempt was made to cancel the transaction from my bank but I was told it was too late and theres nothing that can be done. That no information on the receiving bank is available and they will not fight and dispute the charges."
1908,"On Wednesday XX/XX/21 I received a text message from Wells Fargo at XXXX asking if I made a charge for {$2000.00} at XXXX . I immediately replied NO. A few minutes later a Wells Fargo agent called me about the suspicious charge and verified that my debit card had not been stolen, and I was not traveling. She stated the charge had been made in XXXX, TX. As we were on the phone she asked me if I made an advance for {$15000.00} from my WF credit card to my savings account. I said NO. She went through my other charges in the past hour as I had just logged onto my online account XXXX hour prior and nothing was wrong. She asked me if I made a wire transfer for {$24000.00} to XXXX XXXX. I said NO. She asked me if I knew anyone by that name and if I had added her as a wire transfer recipient that morning. I said NO to all. She immediately canceled my debit card and said she was trying to recall the wire transfer. She said WF would have to call me the next day to set up new checking and savings accounts. The phone service was poor and I could not understand everything she was saying. We got disconnected. 
I called back and spoke with a second person ( a man ) to verify everything. I was on the phone with him for almost 3 hours. He verified again that I had NOT made any of the fraudulent charges including the credit card advance and wire transfer. He could not give me a straight answer as to whether or not the wire transfer had been recalled. He said one system showed it had been recalled, and one system showed it as processed. During this call he ended up issuing me new account numbers, a new username and password, and a new debit card. He gave me a claim number XXXX. He said I would have to wait 10 business days for a letter in the mail letting me know the resolution. 

I called Wells Fargo three more times in the days following for updates and to verify what was going on. The next day on Thursday XX/XX/21 my husband received an email that our accounts were suspended. I called and they said it was because the credit card that the advance was made on was not cancelled. They cancelled and reissued the card and reinstated my accounts. No update on the claim and she could not verify if the wire transfer had been recalled. She said to call back when the charge showed as posted and gave me the Online Credit ( XXXX ) and Claims Dept ( XXXX ) phone numbers. She said the full amount of the wire transfer would be refunded and we would have to pay the credit card advance with that amount. 

I called again on Friday XX/XX/21 when I noticed the wire transfer charge now showed as posted. I spoke with a man that again had no update and said one system showed it as recalled and one system showed it as posted. 

I called again on Thursday XX/XX/21 when I had noticed that the credit card advance and {$750.00} fee were showing refunded, and then added on again, so there were a total of three sets of charges on the credit card account ( charge and fee, refund both, charge and fee again ). The man I spoke with said the claim was under the wire transfer department but the credit card fraud department tried to refund it but they weren't supposed to, so they added it back on. No other update on the claim. 

On Saturday XX/XX/21 we received a letter in the mail stating that Wells Fargo "" determined that the transaction was performed by you '' and "" are unable to reimburse you and have closed your claim ''. The letter is signed by a Fraud and Claims Operations Analyst named XXXX XXXX. The claim number on the letter is XXXX. 

I explicitly and at every opportunity told Wells Fargo that I did NOT make these charges and my username and password was clearly hacked. I was NOT in XXXX, TX. I did NOT add XXXX XXXX as a wire transfer recipient and do NOT know anyone by this name. Yet they still denied my claim, are not returning my stolen {$10000.00}, and are saying I owe {$15000.00} in credit card debt."
1909,I attempted to purchase tickets on XXXX and sent {$140.00} to someone through XXXX via Wells Fargo and the person I sent the money to never returned the money or sent me the tickets.
1910,"Yes, on XX/XX/2019 I purchased a cashiers check for {$10.00} from my bank, Wells Fargo, in the amount of {$500.00}. I purchased this check as a deposit for an apartment/roomshare I planned to move into on XXXX XXXX in XXXX. I answered a classified online ad for the place and had a long conversation with XXXX XXXX, the man who posted the ad, we got a good feel for one another and arranged to see the place, sign a lease agreement for term of one year, and present him with the deposit of {$500.00}, rent to be paid upon move-in a few days following. I was presented with official copy of lease, working keys to the unit along with security codes for alarm and wifi. Following my move-in it became clear very quickly that I was scammed by that man and it turns out he rented the place from XXXX XXXX XXXX himself, then posted ads which myself and at least one other couple responded to, both of us falling for the scam and paying him. I filed a police report immediately with XXXX PD and the report number is : XXXX. The following morning I called the number on the check receipt to find out if it was cashed and if not to put a stop payment on the check since he stole it from me, hoping to get my deposit back because I would need it to find somewhere else to live. I was told after calling that the check had not been negotiated yet, however, despite time being of essence since a criminal could cash check at any time, that they can not stop it by phone and that I must report to a bank branch in order to stop it. This was on morning of Wednesday XX/XX/2019. I rushed to local branch and then waited nearly 30 min to speak to somebody. The woman I spoke to refused to help me with matter because when I filed the police report I gave officer my ID and misplaced it. Despite having an account there w/debit card and pin along with multiple forms of ID and my old DL which just expired, she refused to help. So I immediately went to DMV to buy new ID and filled out forms there and was awaiting my number to called when my misplace ID turned up. I immediately rushed back to bank branch where after waiting my turn again was helped by same woman ( can't recall name but she was a banker in first divided office ) .I was told right off the check still wasn't cashed so she made phone calls that kept her on hold for extended amounts of time while she was doing a lot of paperwork and such. After another hour perhaps when I thought we were finishing up, she said there is some sort of problem suddenly that needs 24 hour investigation and she will have to contact me the following day to come in and finish up. I was very upset and couldn't understand why they can't stop payment on it in meantime to prevent a crook from cashing it, thus aiding a crook to rip me off! So I wasted whole day and still no stop payment! Next day she calls me in late morning and makes appointment for me to come in and finish up, that everything is fine now. When I returned for appointment it was no longer with her but with XXXX XXXX, Banker. He apologized for my troubles with matter over and over and over again. After spending a couple more hours with him on the phone, on hold, with manager, signing papers, meeting with a notary and signing his book, finally when I thought we were all done, he tells me again there's a problem that needs investigating and didn't know how long it would take to resolve. He actually ripped up all the documents right in front of me and asked how he could reach me when he hears something. I was livid! 2 days wasted and still no stop payment! I asked to formally escalate and was told by manager that it has been escalated and I'd need a lawyer to proceed further. Next day I get message from banker to call but couldn't reach him all day. At end of day he calls to say the bank refuses to stop payment because it doesn't meet criteria of being either lost, damaged, or STOLEN ( which it was STOLEN, by deception ) and that is the banks final decision. He confirmed the check can not/will not be stopped and can still be cashed by a man they know stole that money from me in a scam and that police are looking for him AND AT ANY TIME HE CAN STILL CASH THAT CHECK THUS WELLS FARGO WILL KNOWINGLY BE AIDING A THIEF TO STEAL MY MONEY! I ASKED IF I GET THE MONEY BACK IF HE DOESN'T CASH IT AND HIS RESPONSE WAS THAT I WOUULD NEED TO GET A LAWYER, THUS WILL BE KNOWINGLY KEEPING MY {$500.00} IF THE CRIMINAL DOESN'T TAKE IT AND I DON'T GET A LAWYER TO ADDRESS THIS IN COURT.. So the thief gets it or Wells Fargo gets it! And since I can't afford a lawyer, I won't get my money back!!! This is crazy! I'm XXXX on Social Security and have my bank account with Wells Fargo!!! Thieves!!!"
1912,"I attempted to purchase sports tickets through XXXX  on XXXX2018 in the amount of {$110.00} and never received the tickets. I sent the money through XXXX   ( which I thought was backed by Wells Fargo ) and when I contacted the seller by phone it was shut off and I never received the tickets. I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and they stated there was nothing they could do, because they do not own XXXX."
1915,"I was involved in online romance scam starting XX/XX/XXXX. This guy named XXXX XXXX XXXX ( fake name ), was in XXXX XXXX and needed money to get out. Asked me to send the money with four different account in cash from the date of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I sent cash as he said it is urgent and cash works the best and faster to save his life. After I sent money, this guy kept asking more and more money. Then, I realized I got scammed. I went to the Wells Fargo Bank branch XXXX XXXX and asked to freeze their account as they took my cash under false pretense. I asked them to reverse the money as they are online predators and criminals. But, the bank told me they can not reverse the money without the account holders consent which they are not going to as they are scammers they already got my cash money. At this point, I think Wells Fargo Bank is harboring criminals doing online scamming and money laundering. I have all the evidence and the money transferred receipt. Despite of that, Well Fargo Bank is not willing to reverse the money. Please help. I try to reach out to attorney general of Nevada, police, and FBI, as well as lawyers. But, no one is willing to help."
1917,"The recipient ( fraudster ) declare they are kind of debt company and offer the service that they can negotiate with the credit card company ( XXXX XXXX ) to bring down the credit balance. First they ask me for my credit card information and personal information which include online banking username and password because they says that they have to have the information to negotiate with XXXX XXXX. They use my account and make XXXX and wire transfer without my permission and declare that those are the payment for the service. After the XXXX XXXX and first wire {$10000.00} was taken out the wells fargo bank account.They do log in my account ( which XXXX XXXX may have the log in information and IP address for the fraudster. ) And they paid {$11000.00} by XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX account ending in XXXX.

The payments was showed successfully so I didnt report to the police ( when they make payments they will be a time difference when the payments go through ). 
I had called wells fargo and report the situation but they just keep transfer me here and there and let me wait for almost a month. The money was gone for a month and they just keep ignoring me. I cant even know whats the status."
1918,hello. My name is XXXX XXXX. I'm calling in reference to a fraudulent activity done on my online banking with Wells Fargo. The amounts were {$1800.00} and {$700.00}. The date this happened was on XX/XX/XXXX 2019.an ex-girlfriend of mine somehow got into my online banking account and transferred herself these two sums of money to her own account through the XXXX  app . I called the bank the same day after I saw an email so that my contact information was changed to her contact information. She must have gained access through this method. Wells Fargo denied me the claim because they thought I gave her my online banking information which was not true. I waited many days for them to resolution to simply be denied.I followed all the correct steps as far as a fraud case goes where I called in a timely manner close my accounts change my online information reopen new accounts and also filed a police report. My Wells Fargo claim number is XXXX. Also the XXXX city police report number is XXXX. I am upset that my bank will not retrieve my money from an unauthorized user fraudulently accessing my account.
1920,"On Tuesday, XX/XX/2019, I was searching on XXXX for tickets to the XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX for game 3 in XXXX Playoffs. I found an ad that had pictures and information on the seats, and for how much. The price was {$190.00} for 2 tickets. I had contacted the person to set up a meeting and to buy the tickets. Through text message, XXXX XXXX requested money to be sent through XXXX and would then have the tickets transferred over through XXXX. I transferred the money, and heard nothing back from the person. I never received the tickets and was scammed out of {$190.00}. I then immediately call up Wells Fargo and issue a claim on the scam. Through transfer after transfer, I finally get my claim issued, after multiple telling me that ill most likely get my money back through the claim due to the information on the scam. Today, on XX/XX/XXXX, I follow up on the claim and here that the issue has been closed and declined due to it being XXXX related, this ofcourse after a countless amounts of transfers once again. According to Wells Fargo employees, XXXX claims never come back approved, so why even issue the claim in the first place, in addition why would multiple tellers tell me that they were confident in receiving my money back. In addition, apparently any XXXX account can be created with any phone number, and not the one thats tied to the bank account, which sounds like a total security hole. The money should be issued back from Wells Fargo as a refund due to the fraud protection, with money transfers are included in, which includes XXXX."
1923,"I got scammed by an entity that pretending to be a legit employer. They offered me a job, sent me a check, and asked me to deposit the check and pay vendors through XXXX  and wire transfer to setup home office. 

On XX/XX/2022, I deposited a check of XXXX dollar at the bank thinking it was a valid check. Wells Fargo verified the check, cashed it, and check processed and money became available in my account. Employer asked me to transfer XXXX dollar through XXXX. 

Then, on XX/XX/2022, as all XXXX dollar processed and became available, employer asked me to do multiple XXXX and wire transfers. So i did XXXX dollar through XXXX XXXX transactions to XXXX XXXX and XXXX dollar wire transfer to XXXX XXXX XXXX, thinking they are valid vendors. 

On XX/XX/2022, I received notification from Wells Fargo that they returned the check. At that time, it hit me and I realized i've been scammed. I straight away called the bank and let them know, and even went to the branch. Branch asked me to call, when I called it keeps transferring me to here and there and it's very hard to talk to anyone. 

But my disappointment is why Wells Fargo verified, processed, and cashed a false check. Now I lost XXXX dollar of my savings for my XXXX son. I'm a single mother and this is really difficult for me. 

Reference number of cases reported to Wells Fargo - XXXX - XXXX - XXXX - XXXX"
1924,"Hello My Name is XXXX and i am a customer with wells fargo bank for more than 10 years, during the years i open more and more accounts with WF and eventually WF is the ONLY bank i work with, i have 2 business accounts and 7 personal accounts with WF, the amount in each and every account is high and i know i have who to trust when it comes to my money, the reason i contact you today is because 3 months ago i received money from out of USA, as my father pass away, the money was transferred to my WF account ending in XXXX on XXXX XXXX : I received NIS XXXX which make it ( if we go by the same day exchange rate XX/XX/21 ) XXXX XXXX ( XXXX $ =XXXXNIS ) while in reality i received XXXX XXXX now ; i understand that the exchange rate for forgien currency will not be the same as the international daily rate and the bank needs to have some profit on the transaction but the bank charged me almost 5000 $ profit!! ( bank convert it as XXXX $ = XXXXNIS ) which made me very upset and frustrated feeling like i've been misled by the WF branch banker who opened the account from the beginning and knew that this money will be transferred in forgien currency, the banker never told me i will have to be charged additional 2 % ( which is more then double then what other banks charge ) on top of whatever the exchange rate is! what caused me to pay almost 5000 $ to the bank while this money was from my father 's will! 

So I've contacted the exchange currency department of WF ; they explained me how they did the convert and then i realise i was charged 2 % fee on top of the conversion fee, after i asked to file a claim they forward me to XXXX  complaint management office, ( see case XXXX ) and out of good will they were able to credit my account for an additional XXXX $ ; after 2 months when I am back and forth with them, which is ridiculous!! 
so i called again to XXXX XXXX XXXX the executive manager from the XXXX office who signed on the letter to tell him that i DO NOT accept this solution and that my sister received the same amount in NIS to her XXXX bank and received XXXX $ and when she tried to tell me i should transfer the money to XXXX bank i didn't believe her, because i was counting on WF to be the most affordable bank to me, i told the rep that if i knew from the beginning that i will be charged this amount for fees i would never do it with wells fargo ; he said he will escalate my case again "" but nothing else can be done '', and again, few days after i received a letter that nothing else can be done and the XXXX $ credit they gave me on XXXX is the only solution they can offer and this is a one time goodwill gesture. 

Now let me ask you something : as a loyal customer- why this is the way I've been treated? When I actually was misled with information when I first open this account? 
why does the letter I received say how WF cares about their customers but there is nothing they can do?! 
how WF regret when a customer express dissatisfaction but "" sorry we can not do anything for you '' and Why, as an account holder with almost 800k in assets, i am getting treated like that? 
I told him I will be happy if WF will be able to round the amount to the same amount my sister received which will make it only XXXX $ additional to WF to credit and he keeps telling me that this is impossible?? imposible to the bank to help a long time good customer?? a customer who put all his money in this bank? a customer who already paid his duties to the bank when depositing large amounts of money every day! 

this is my last act before i am closing all my accounts with WF, as i will have to transfer now more money from out of USA due to my father will, and i no longer want to do it with WF, as i am very disappointed and very unhappy with the level of service i received, and i will go with it all the way, and i will close my accounts with WFm because if i am not getting treated the way i want and i don't want to do a business with a vendor who's not respect me, please advise how you can help me, your help will be much appreciated,"
1925,"I took my kids checks ( earned from small XXXX  XXXX  jobs that pay per day so we had several checks per kid, and they wanted cash ) to the -issuing bank-, Wells Fargo . They asked if I had an account there to deposit them, and I said no, I just wanted them cashed. They charged me {$7.00} per check without informing me that it would be a charge. I find this a ridiculously predatory fee, and predatory in how it was carried out. It amounted to more than 10 % of the checks amounts. From the bank who issued the checks, the bank that can check its own customers accounts in real time if desired, and assumes virtually no risk in cashing the checks. Even XXXX checking services charges less. 

How can a bank charge to cash its own checks?"
1927,"I previously notified Wells Fargo that they were processing fraudulent transactions which attempted to debit my company 's checking account on complaint XXXX. These transactions appear to be coming from their credit card division which appears to have insufficient controls and/or is not following industry best practices to prevent fraud. 
The result of that complaint was Wells Fargo told me that there was nothing they could do to stop fraud routed through their credit card division. Since that date, 3 additional transactions have attempted to debit my account. I'll attach a file of the amount, the date of the transaction, the ACH trace number, and the included ACH payer id of Wells."
1929,"I purchased a pair of boots from XXXX XXXX online. When I received the boots, the zipper was broken. I sent the boots back and XXXX XXXX reimbursed my debit card XXXX, for the cost of the boots. XXXX XXXX also sent me a letter stating that they refunded the XXXX to my debit card with Wells Fargo bank. I have spent at least seven hours on the phone with Wells Fargo 's executive department and they can not reimburse me the funds because I closed my checking account with them thirty days prior to XXXX XXXX putting XXXX on my old debit card. Wells Fargo said they closed the claim because they sent the funds to XXXX XXXX. In the letter from XXXX XXXX, it specifically states that XXXX XXXX has no account or way to accept funds. This has been going on since XX/XX/XXXX. It is now XX/XX/XXXX. I am filing a fraud complaint since Wells Fargo will not pay me XXXX."

He sent a photo and the. Emailed me checks and I deposited them and to prove I was loyal I had to send him some back. These checks then bounced and I was left with XXXX because I had already spent and sent money thinking the checks were real.
1936,"I transferred money through XXXX Wells Fargo mobile banking app to purchase sporting event tickets. I used Wells Fargo, he claimed he had Wells Fargo as well. The guy XXXX XXXX gave me his name, email address and phone number. He said this was the service he was most comfortable with. Since he had used it before. Mr. XXXX gave me all the details but failed to mention it was a scam. I contacted Wells Fargo immediately and attempted to cancel the transaction but the transfer went through. I did not receive tickets that I paid for through XXXX. The transaction was sent and received from the same institution. I sensed foul play and I became very concerned that I was involved in a scam. Wells Fargo knows where the money was sent they even told me they attempted to contact the financial institute but there is nothing they can do to recover the money. The transaction date was XX/XX/2019,  transaction amount was {$120.00} and my Wells Fargo claim # XXXX. Please help me recover my money."

1938,"On XX/XX/20, At around XXXX, I XXXX XXXX XXXX attempted to cash my check from the Wells Fargo Branch located on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , NM, XXXX. At around XXXX I had called the ( XXXX ) XXXX and spoke with a gentleman named XXXX ( I think ) over the phone. I asked XXXX if it were ok if I had parked my car in the parking lot and could cash my check at the drive through without a car. XXXX told me Wells Fargo would accommodate my needs so I could cash my check. When I arrived at the teller via drive through, with out a car, I encountered and spoke with Service Manager 1 XXXX XXXX Employee ID : XXXX XXXX. Mr. XXXX told me that he would not cash my check despite me explaining to him I was told by a Wells Fargo employee over the phone that Wells Fargo would accommodate my needs to cash my check via drive through without using a car. I also told Mr. XXXX I had waited for an hour and was told it would be ok via phone call and showed him the phone number I had dialed. Mr. XXXX did not cash my check. As I was leaving Mr. XXXX told me I should get a bank account to avoid this issue. Then I contacted the branch again via telephone to see if it were possible for me to schedule an appointment, in person, so I could cash my check. I spoke with a person named XXXX using telephone number ( XXXX ) XXXX. I was told the branch would not cash a check in person and that it would have to be through drive through. I told the person ( I lied ) that I didn't have a vehicle to cash my check via drive through, so how would I cash my check? Their reply was that I would need a vehicle to cash my check. 

I then decided to cash my check via drive through, using my car. At around XXXX I spoke with the same person Mr. XXXX via drive through. 

My issue is this : After speaking with Customer Service over the phone and being told I wouldn't be able to set up an appointment to go in person to cash my check because appointments were not needed to cash a check. 
I was told, via telephone, appointments are only to open/close accounts and or other banking needs not related with cashing a check. At around the end of my recording I mentioned to XXXX XXXX during this whole pandemic people without vehicles will not be able to cash their checks in the lobby. Mr. XXXX didn't reply to my question and referred me to the feedback card. 

The problem with this is people who do not have a vehicle nor direct deposit nor access to a device to take a picture and send via mobile app to Wells Fargo will not be able to cash their checks with the branch."

1959,"Elder financial Abuse My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX, a XXXX Veteran XXXX on railroad XXXX. XXXX ID XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I received an Itemized statement from Wells Fargo. On the statement date of XX/XX/XXXX states XXXX XXXX from XXXX, and sold the loan by Wells Fargo. Then on XX/XX/XXXX charge XXXX XXXX Charge Number XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo filed foreclosure. On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo alleges that the loan was paid off. On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo suddenly dismisses the lawsuit which is the second foreclosure lawsuit Wells Fargo has dismissed on the home since XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX A payoff statement was ordered from alleged to be XXXX  XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo sends a letter to me in XX/XX/XXXX stating congratulations the loan was paid off with a release of mortgage. Wells Fargo has never disclosed how the loan was paid off or why the Foreclosure was dismissed. I had an attorney at the time XXXX XXXX who I was paying a monthly bill to help me save my home. I thought all the loans on the home were paid off after my wife passed away on XX/XX/XXXX through the probate of a wrongful death. 
However, a XXXX Home Equity line of Credit was taken out in XX/XX/XXXX. My Last payment was in XXXX with the real mortgage company XXXX before they closed. 
Out of no where a Bank XXXX New York XXXX alleges to have received assignment from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX which is about 6 years after my last payment. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX was calling me asking me to send documents regarding a previous loan with XXXX which I did not understand why. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX filed a foreclosure on the home without my knowledge or being served in any lawsuit. Wells Fargo filed a foreclosure XX/XX/XXXX. 
When I found about it the foreclosure with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX it was XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX stated to have no record of the home or involvement with XXXX XXXX XXXX. It appears that XXXX XXXX XXXX using the name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  as a decoy to hide XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX from any involvement or liability with the foreclosure lawsuit. In the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I also discovered that documents were forged in my name as if I made appearances in court when I was working at the XXXX at the time. 
Then I hired an attorney on XX/XX/XXXX after that and not sure what happened next until now. Wells Fargo Alleged to have sold the loan in XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo claims it was paid off on XX/XX/XXXX it can not be both. 
XXXX XXXX  XXXX is alleging that it paid off the loan from Wells Fargo. When it was alleged to already been sold off. XXXX XXXX  XXXX instead alleged to have consolidated the loan to avoid Wells Fargo foreclosure on the home that would have wiped any second liens on the title. I dont believe any loan was actually paid off to Wells Fargo XXXX Wells Fargo or XXXX  XXXX XXXX is refusing to produce any payment information or wire transfer as to who, when, why or where this alleged payment was made. 
Now XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is claiming that it alleged to have paid off the loan, and added Wells Fargo loan to the old XXXX loan. I never knew anything about this at all. I have never signed anything or applied for any, new loans, refinance, loan modifications, Deed, in lieu, forbearance or reverse mortgage, confirming consolidating anything with XXXX  XXXX XXXX. Nor have I applied for loans above with any other lenders regarding the home. 
XXXX XXXX  XXXX claims to have been paying extra home insurance on the home, Taxes, Wells Fargo transferred loan adding taxes to this amount. The amount XXXX alleged to owe with XXXX XXXX XXXX is over XXXX on a home that is under water and worth less than XXXX. This is fraud, because I did not do any of this. Im being harassed by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX for money that I do not rightfully owe. 
I also recently discovered that Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX removed my name on the loan documents, and placed my former attorneys name to receive my loan billing statements. In the end my attorney claims to not know anything. Then later my former Attorney stated that he thinks XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX paid it off. I was never informed by my former attorneys that anything was paid off for me to have to pay it later with another lender, or servicer. 
Wells Fargo had me sign a loan Modification that originated by XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  VA loan that I had on the home in XXXX. The loan was alleged to be acquired by Wells Fargo in XXXX. However, this can not be confirmed. Because IXXXX XXXX XXXX  Received Government Assistance Failed on XX/XX/XXXX. The loan was created in XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX BXXXX XXXXXXXX. VA secured loan. 
In XXXX Wells Fargo pressured me to sign a loan Modification changing those terms of the original loan from a VA loan to a regular Mortgage without informing me of that. XXXX, XXXX also did not get any approval from the VA to change the terms of the loan which was higher well above my income amount. Which now have me in the situation Im in today. Then soon after the loan Modification was completed a Bank called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX filed a foreclosure less than 30 days later after alleged to have signed a subornation agreement with Wells Fargo. Now Im in a process to be evicted from my home by alleged to be XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I believe its XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX using the name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to Evict me from my home. XXXX XXXX  XXXX also allege that I owe over XXXX to them that I know nothing about as well. I feel I have been a victim of XXXX financial abuse, consumer fraud and fair debt collections act practices and mortgage foreclosure scam by hired law firm. It does appear that XXXX XXXX  XXXX and Wells Fargo were working together as this is connected with the National Mortgage Settlement ( XXXX ). Wells Fargo filed the first foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Illinois XXXX XXXX. I was also informed that the alleged judgment by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is invalid. The Eviction case on the home is XXXX. However, the eviction case was dismissed in XX/XX/XXXX. Whomever is working with alleged XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is still trying to pursue the Eviction case despite being dismissed for want to prosecute on XX/XX/XXXX. The Eviction case was not refiled within one year or vacated. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX is Threatened to sue me for debt not owed. I also have reason to believe that additional lawsuits have been filed against me By XXXX XXXX  XXXX or XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that Im not aware of. Nor was I served by anyone regarding any new lawsuits. Seeking assistance with this matter. 


Wells Fargo filed a foreclosure XX/XX/XXXX. I hired an attorney in XX/XX/XXXX after that and not sure what happened next until now. Wells Fargo Alleged to have sold the loan in XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo claims it was paid off on XX/XX/XXXX it can not be both. 
Docket one- This XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX statement says that I made payments when I have not made any of these payments to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I feel that someone took out a loan in my name and identity with Bank XXXX XXXX for me to pay it back later which is fraud. Im also a victim of identity as well since XXXX. 
Docket Two- This a document that was Submitted to the XXXX with false claims that the home was vacant. When the home was not Vacant to have me restricted from accessing the home and my property removed from the home. 
Despite a wrongfully filed Eviction case against the home during the Illinois Eviction moratorium in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Who is really XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX? XXXX XXXX has been harassing us at the home and her husband for years. I have proof that she has been disparaging us with random people while claiming to be the realtor of the bank. Then she seems to not be sure what bank she is alleged to be working with. But have uploaded old outdated documents from XXXX XXXX  XXXX. The Vacancy document has XXXX XXXX XXXX on it as well.

1961,"In XXXX, 2021 over XXXX on transactions were transferred, in ONE day, to a person I had yelled only a handful of times. I brought this attention to Wells Fargo the next day due to it was Sunday & XXXX was closed. ( this occurred on XXXX XXXX, I will never forget because I check my balance online daily, at the minimum & I went into panic mode ). They referred me to the fraud department who investigated and finally sent a letter in the bank 's favor, the transactions where legitimate. I contested the decision & was working with a woman named XXXX. I explained repeatedly I did not authorize these transactions ; XXXX in 24 hours and is well over the amount you can XXXX  to a person incrementally or at once. Wells Fargo closed my case after escalating ad high as I possibly could, including contacting headquarters. I'm out XXXX and basically had zero recourse."
1964,"My name is XXXX  XXXX. I had contacted the website XXXX to buy one of their dogs. They have a legit website, testimonials, everything to look real. The cost of shipping was included with the dog. Total cost XXXX dollars (XXXX through XXXX and XXXX to the delivery driver). So my friend actually sent my money with her XXXX   app since my bank doesn't support it (Her name is XXXX  XXXX). She banks through Wells Fargo. The email for the recipient for XXXX  was XXXX (so his name is XXXX XXXX??). After I sent the money I typed in the web address of the dog adoption site and it showed up on XXXX.  The seller denied fraudulent claims. After a few text I've heard nothing. It was obviously a scam, and scammers love XXXX  apparently because there is no fraud protection. The number (which is never answered) is XXXX. So I don't know if there is anything that can be done. Also if my friend XXXX  needs to file anything?  She did contact Wells Fargo shortly after sending the money. Probably won't get anywhere with that."
1969,"I planned on leasing an apartment with a seller through paypal and when it came to complete the transaction the seller failed to provide their services. I contacted XXXX to get a refund and they refused. I also contacted my bank, Wells Fargo, and they were unable to help me get as well. In fact, Wells Fargo was belligerent and rude, but would not let me speak to a supervisor or reimburse me for the money spent. Decent banks don't fight you on an obvious case of fraud."
1972,We called Wells Fargo to do a foreign currency exchange. During the call we were told there would be a {$7.00} charge if we did the exchange on  line. When we got home from the bank with the currency we ordered we realized that the bank had taken about 10 % off the exchange rate in addition to the {$7.00} fee. At no time were we told there would be an exchange rate conversion fee or what that amount would be. I understand that this is a small amount but believe this to be a trick for them to take money from unsuspecting consumers.
1973,"I received a paystub from Wells Fargo, for money owed to me. Paystub states check date of XX/XX/2018, for deposit to my checking account. It was not direct deposited. I called payroll, who told me to call another department. After 7 calls, an outside vendor confirmed that the money was disbursed to Wells Fargo for further payment to me and sent me back to payroll to find out why it was not deposited. Payroll sent me back through the same calls. I do not have my money. Previously, another complaint about Wells Fargo. They paid me, then sent a dunning letter, telling me they had overpaid me and demanded the funds back. I don't know if this is similar situation where they tell me it is my money and then take it back."
1975,"On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, unauthorized cash advances were made using my credit card in the amount of {$8000.00} in advances, {$400.00} in advance fees, and shortly afterward {$44.00} in interest fees, as well as a {$2000.00} unauthorized transfer of money from my savings account. This was done unbeknownst to me by a company claiming to be XXXX, giving me a refund due for past services. 

When I figured out what had happened, I reported it to my bank ( Wells Fargo ) who then closed my accounts and opened up new accounts for me. This was on XX/XX/XXXX. However, most of the transactions continued to show up on the XXXX in my new accounts. I placed a claim of fraud with the bank, and all they did was deny my claim, remove {$4000.00} from my checking and apply it as a credit against my credit card that over {$8400.00} had been charged in unauthorized cash advances, ( leaving me over {$4400.00} in debt for something I didn't authorize and obliterating my checking account ), as well as deny the replacement of funds of {$2000.00} that were unauthorized as a transfer out of my savings - all of the above unauthorized transactions had the subtitle of : REFUND FROM XXXX. 

When some of the funds appeared in my checking with that subtitle ( REFUND FROM XXXX ), I was told I had been over-refunded and needed to return the overage to XXXX - which I did. I had no idea these funds were my own money. I was only attempting to be a honest person and return funds that were not due me. 

However, Wells Fargo has denied me any recompense for these fraudulent activities I've suffered, instead making sure that I'm held responsible for the acts, instead of fulfilling their duty of protecting me and my money, and replacing those funds that were removed/charged against me by unauthorized requests. 

The bottom line is, I did not authorize the removal of funds from my Savings,  nor did I authorize cash advances to my credit card. Wells Fargo is supposed to be responsible for assuring the safety of my money that I entrust them with. When I went to my Wells Fargo branch in person and reported this fraud against me, they assured me that I would be recompensed the full amount of {$10000.00}. However in the claim letter I received in the mail, they have denied me any and all recompense, instead removing funds from my checking account to credit my credit card, and then leaving me with {$4200.00} of debt on my credit card, and {$2000.00} less in my Savings, and very little money in my checking for paying my regular bills. 

The government and banks are supposed to be insuring my money and the safety of it and me against fraud and scams. Instead, Wells Fargo has run me over with their stage coach, and driven off laughing, with what little money I have as a retiree. And me a Wells Fargo member for 39 years."
1976,"Wire transfers in the amount of {$4100.00} was wired by Wells Fargo Bank to XXXX XXXX XXXX on behalf of a known fraudster known as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. These wires were made between XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Several attempts were made by me between XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX to recover the funds directly from XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I requested a wire recall directly from Wells Fargo, no satisfaction has been made to date. 

A complaint by me has also been filed through your organization against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"

I hope you can return my money shortly."
1979,Wells Fargo staff is v disrespectful not helping at all no idea where to go
1982,I was negotiating the cost of a puppy online and was requested to use XXXX for the transfer - turned out that the person was scamming multiple people out of thousands of dollars. Wells Fargo offers this service and advertises it as a method to instantly and securely transfer funds. They failed to make it known to the consumer that they offer no recourse for these mishaps and refuse to assist in any way and blame it on its the users discretion whether they review terms and conditions before every single transaction. Not taking into account that not every consumer has the ability to fully access and/or comprehend the details therein.
1985,"Greetings my name is XXXX XXXX. I have been trying for weeks now to get Wells Fargo to refund money I sent from my bank account to another account. This all started on the XXXX of XXXX. I sent an ACH transfer from XXXX XXXX XXXX  to my XXXX   account. The money has to go through Wells Fargo to get there. The total amount sent was XXXX. I setup the transfer from XXXX XXXX XXXX online it only took me a few minutes to complete the transaction, I hit send, XXXX XXXX XXXX  sends me the confirmation the transfer is going through and will be sent by next day. Friday came no money was in the account. Monday and Tuesday came still no money in the XXXX account. So I called XXXX for the next 5 days asking why the XXXX had not posted to my account. XXXX does an investigation and they can not find any trace of the money coming to them. So I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX  and was told that the money was sent and they received confirmation from Wells Fargo that they received the money. I contacted XXXX again and told them the bank sent the money and it should be there. XXXX does a longer investigation for about 1 day and still they could not find the money. I recontacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and they started and looking into it and found out that Wells Fargo was sending the money back to me because the routing number was incorrect. It should be returned to me in about 1-10 business days. 10 pass and nothing from Wells Fargo, I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX  and ask for a claim to be filed against the money I sent. I called 5 days later and XXXX XXXX XXXX  told me Wells Fargo still has not contacted them. Next I file a claim against Wells Fargo on the XXXX XXXX XXXX website and awaited a response that came. I was told that there wasn't much that person could do to look into the matter and I needed to speak with XXXX XXXX XXXX. It is now now 4 weeks later I am still waiting on a response from XXXX XXXX XXXX  from Wells Fargo and the person who handled the transaction and still no answers. This should not take this long."
1986,"Companies : Wells Fargo, XXXX, XXXX  Date : XX/XX/2018 Subject : Event ticket scam facilitated through XXXX Amount : < {$300.00} Problem Summary : Actions and Inactions which facilitated scammer protections I was a victim of an event ticket scam where I transferred money from my Wells Fargo account via XXXX  and the seller went dark as soon as the transaction was done. The sellers account was at XXXX. I called Wells Fargo and explained there was no fraud or mistake on the part of Wells Fargo in the sense that I knowingly transferred money through XXXX. I was surprised Wells Fargo credited my account - they explained that the money would be reversed if there was no "" fraud '' ( or some such concept ). This was claim XXXX. I followed up several times, not so much for the money, but because I wanted the scammer to be stopped. Wells Fargo eventually closed the case and deducted the money from my account that they originally credited as they found no evidence of wrong on their part. Well, no kidding - alot of wasted time & frustration all around - While Wells Fargo had no obligation to make amends, the situation was what I explained at that first call. I pressed them for options on what to do and they said there were none. They did disclose to me that the name I specified on the transfer was *not* correct but obviously the email address was correct.

I didn't care about the money so much but wanted justice for the perpetrator.

I contacted XXXX through their support portal stating that this perpetrator was in violation of their end user agreement - that you would not use XXXX  for illegal means- but did not even get a courtesy of any reply.

Why is it that financial privacy laws are allowed to protect people that use their services for illegal activities such as this?"
1987,"Around the time of XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX I had experience fraud or scam activity on my account which were mobile deposits of {$470.00} ( Honestly forgot the amount but I do know it was 4 something ). I called Wells Fargo to figure out where was the activity coming from and they said they would help figure out where it would be coming from. The accountants at the Wells Fargo brach asked if I shared my mobile banking info. My Answer was No I NEVER do that. I knew something was odd about it because no one ever sends me mobile deposits but my Uncle & when he does transfer me funds it says his name, implus he barely sent money to me around this time. When I saw the weird amounts pop up I automatically gave my bank a call. Ive had them for months & experiences horrible service from them, there would always be money talking out and much more. Just would like this situation resolved."
1990,"This is the second time I have complained through here Wells Fargo are sneaky XXXX. They know from the ticket created on my original complaints with them the item was accidentally deposited twice because at first they did not show my deposit into mobile banking through the app so I thought it didnt work and tried the atm which they had immediately created a ticket to cancle out the atm XXXX moments after it occurred and I called them to let them know about the duplicate deposit attempt to try to get my cashiers check funds deposited to pay for my car and get home. They held that mozbile deposit long after canceling out the atm thing that got corrected. I was XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX If I was not so established with my checking account I would change banks because Wells Fargo did nothing but hurt me I intentionally and now in order to cover it up responded only with partial and misleading details about my initial complaint. They did not learn from or respect the last class action that was filed against them. They still use unfair buisiness practices. That cashiers check they had already kept {$3500.00} when it was issue and those funds should have been made immediately available but they werent. I actually called repeatedly for days to finally get someone to expedite the clearing of my check that never should have been held. If it showed as a mobile deposit immediately and cleared as it should have in the first place no atm deposit would have occurred erroneously. They know it too! Yet they chose to respond to the last complaint with that was a fraudulent deposit that couldnt be verified and withheld to you that they already were informed by me that it was such and how it happened and that my complaint was that the initial deposit that they chose to deem the real deposit and negate the second atm XXXX., leaving : the mobile deposit deemed the real check ( both a duplicated transaction with the same check number as further more clearly explained how it happed above ). It was a real cashiers check and I should not have had to wait days for the funds that XXXX deposit should have been immediate. They gave no choice to cancle prior to telling me it would need days to clear. Then at first the mobile deposit didnt even show in my account on the app so I thought it glitched and that is when I tried the atm XXXX ad detailed more clearly above. They kept my funds for days without any access to them and left me stranded when they already had my money it was a cashiers check. Mobile deposit made me upload photos that showed what it was and their app should have been able to verify the mobile deposited cashiers check that was funded by their bank and they had the funds already because it was a pre funded certified check that cost {$10.00} to have immediate funds available in that check!"
1992,"On XX/XX/31 my phone was stolen. Using find my XXXX on my XXXX, I was able to track the location of my stolen phone. Local sheriffs office refused to accompany me to the location so I went myself. When I showed them my state police badge, they gave me the phone back. When I checked my bank account I noticed the person who stole my phone sent {$500.00} from my bank account via XXXX. Im assuming this is due to me not having any passcodes on my phone ( Because the face recognition does not work when wearing a mask ) So I submitted a fraud claim with my bank, Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo denied my claim, despite me not authorizing this transaction. I contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and received an automated acknowledgment email stating I would hear something back within 10 business days. I have heard nothing. I emailed again on XX/XX/XXXX. Again, nothing back."
1993,"I sold my home. The attorney deposited my proceeds into my bank account at Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2018. Today is XX/XX/2018 and my funds are still not available. I contacted Wells Fargo last Thursday XX/XX/2018 regarding the hold they placed on my funds. I was told the hold would be withdrawn and the funds would be available in a day. When the funds did not become available, I contacted the bank again. 

I am now told it will be tomorrow XX/XX/2018. While I understand a hold on a large deposit, I feel from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX is beyond reasonable. The money deposited was from an attorney who distributed the money at my home closing. I am purchasing a home and need the funds. Hopefully, the money will be in my account tomorrow - XX/XX/XXXX - but I would appreciate someone looking into this matter. I have been a long time very good customer of Wells Fargo and I do not appreciate what feels like their denial of my money. 

Thank you."
1994,My friend wired me money and somehow at the bank one number was messed up and I didnt receive the money in my account. The banks system had my name and address but did not check if the account number matched my name.
1996,"On XX/XX/2017 I withdraw {$200.00} dollars ( XXXX {$20.00} XXXXr bills ) out of a Wells Fargo ATM machine located at XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX  of the {$20.00} XXXX bills dispensed by the ATM was mutilated missing about XXXX of the bill. I immediately called Wells Fargo to inform them, but they redirected my to my bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX because they said "" I do not have a bank account with Wells Fargo. '' I then called XXXX XXXX and filled a claim with them. After about 2 months of not hearing from XXXXXXXX XXXX, I finally called them and was told that no claim had been filled back when I called in XXXX. A claim was finally filled then, and after waiting 2 additional weeks I finally got a letter from XXXX XXXX stating the following : "" We are unable to file a dispute for a torn bill. The dispute process governs the results of the transaction, not the condition of the bills provided. 
We regret that we are unable to assist you with your dispute. If you wish to pursue this matter further, we suggest that you contact the merchant directly. As of the date of this letter, your dispute claim has been closed. '' After reading this letter I called XXXXXXXX XXXX for further explanation and was told that they are not responsible for the condition of the bills or money dispense by other ATMs, including Wells Fargo, and was provided information and website on how to contact the U.S. Department of Treasury for a bill exchange, and/or was told that I could try to discuss the matter further with Wells Fargo. I then called Wells Fargo and was told by 3 different individuals that they are not responsible for the condition of the bills/money they dispense because the ATMs are serviced by third party companies who have their own procedures, and that they could not file a claim for my complaint because I am not a XXXX XXXX costumer. I was again provided information on how to request a bill exchange with the U.S. Department of Treasury if I so desired. 

I would really appreciate your assistance in trying to understand, how is it that banks are not directly responsible for the quality of the money/bills that they dispense out of the ATMs? Why does Wells Fargo charge me a transaction fee if they are not going be responsible for malfunctioning of the ATMs? I would really hope this is not true or else what assurance do we customers have that we will be properly refunded if the money dispensed is not in an acceptable condition or there are any other problems during a transaction. 

Thank you in advance!

So this means I just lost {$560.00} to a person I have no idea who it is and the bank was no help!!"

Upon reviewing the documentation, I discovered that the bank rep had made TWO mistakes typing the IBAN number on the transfer. I had found the first one at the time, but she sent the wire after that and signed off on it. My brother-in-law in the XXXX was in dire need of these funds ( {$22000.00} ) as he was laid off from his airline position, his employer revoked his visa and the gov't is threatening him with prison if he does not leave IMMEDIATELY!

I called every day for 2 1/2 weeks and the customer service people at the bank transferred me to a different online department every time and told me that they were still awaiting a resolution, but that they were optimistic as far as the outcome because the wire transfer was the result of a fraud. Every day I called, got transferred a few times, then got the same response and they told me to keep calling. Today I called again and the representative at Wells Fargo online wire transfers told me the case had been closed 10 days ago and that they would not recover my funds since the beneficiary 's bank had refused to refund the money.

This is wrong, they know you dont have money and they also know they can charge fees, crazy fees for overdraft, this was an accident, not purposeful. 

Come on government, make it fair, everyone is tired of being ripped off. Its simple, if you dont have money, you cant transfer it, not go head and we will chrArge you crazy fees.

2010,"I am an XXXX  year-old man on a fixed income. I am XXXX  XXXX and am in XXXX  after battling XXXX for the last year and a half. On XX/XX/2020 I was having problems accessing my XXXX XXXX XXXX account on my TV so I asked my cell phone to call XXXX support. My phone said "" I found this number for XXXX support on the internet, would you like me to call it? '' and I said yes. A man answered the call and identified himself as an XXXX support attendant. I told him I was having problems and he said he could see the issue but would need access to my computer to fix it. I granted him access. He said there were a number of issues to deal with and that he could see that someone recently purchased an XXXX XXXX on my account. I told him I had not made that purchase. He said he could fix it but would need my credit card number. I gave him the number. He said he accidentally credited my account {$3900.00} so he was going to correct that. He said he took care of the iphone charge but that it was going to take a while to fix my account because someone had hacked my computer and installed programs that were going to steal from me. He said I could go about my business while he worked on the problem. I left the situation and returned the next morning to check my computer. I found that he still had control of my computer. I called him and he said they were still working on the issues. I asked how much longer it would take and he said he wasn't sure so I again left the situation and went about my business. I returned to my computer on Monday, XX/XX/2020 and found that he still had control of my computer. I told him that if he didn't release control I would call the authorities. He released control and I checked my bank account to find that there were a number of credit card cash advances and wire transfers showing on my account. I immediately called the bank ( Wells Fargo ) to report what happened and let them know I did not perform or authorize those transactions. The bank closed my credit card and checking accounts and issued new cards and new checking account number. The bank said that they tried to recover the money wire transferred but when they did the receiving bank said there was no money to recover. Wells Fargo says that's all they can do."
2013,"On XX/XX/22 I contacted the Wells Fargo Bank XXXX department to file a claim in the amount of {$710.00} for XXXX transactions via XXXX which occurred on XX/XX/22. 

Today, I received a letter stating that my claim was researched and their office found that the transactions were performed by myself or someone authorized to use my XXXX account. Therefore, the provisional credit I was given when I filed my claim would be reversed and my claim would be closed. 

I am writing to further explain the situation which occurred in hopes that I XXXX appeal their decision and receive a refund for the loss I incurred. 


On XX/XX/22 I found an item on the XXXX  app which I was interested in purchasing. It was a XXXX XXXX machine. The list price was {$500.00} by a seller named XXXX. 
I used XXXX to make the payment for the item as the seller informed me that he was unable to ship the merchandise using XXXX  shipping as there was a size/weight limit and the XXXX machine exceeded that limit. Therefore, I couldnt pay for the item through the XXXX app so I opted to do it through XXXX. 

Below is a series of screenshots from a text thread which ensued over the next couple of days. 
As you will see, he claimed initially, that my payment didnt go through, however, it was showing completed on my end and according to Wells Fargo XXXX payment was sent. The seller then told me his wifes account had limits so I would have to resend the payment to him instead. He also stated that their bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  told them I would be refunded in 3 days. He provided me another XXXX email. I told him I would resend the payment once I received my refund. He also sent me a receipt from a XXXX store showing the delivery charge. 
I agreed to send him the money for the shipping cost. He was not happy and at this point I began to suspect I was being scammed. The receipt he provided me from the XXXX store looked quite legitimate ( it is also included in the text thread attachments ), however I decided to call the actual store listed on the receipt to confirm my item was sent. 
The XXXX person I emailed informed me that it was indeed a false receipt. 

I decided it was best to inform my bank, Wells Fargo, as the fraudulent transaction occurred using XXXX which is a service that Wells Fargo provides its customers. 
When speaking with the representative who took my claim information, at no time did I deny sending the money to the fraudsters. My claim WAS NOT because someone else used my account without permission, but rather I was provided XXXX  different XXXX emails which I believed were legitimate XXXX customers and there was no flag or any indication that these individuals were suspicious. Although, I find it hard to believe that if they have been doing this awhile, no one had caught on and suspended them from using the XXXX service. 
I NEVER received the products/service which I paid for through XXXX so XXXX am disputing the fact that my claim was denied. 


I felt that I would have no recourse with XXXX as the transaction was done outside of their app and they are quite clear that buyer protection is only offered for transactions done through their XXXX app."
2014,"I bank with Wells Fargo and I did a Wells Fargo XXXX transfer on XX/XX/2018. The person I sent the funds to was suppose to do a job for me and never completed it. I asked Wells Fargo to do a claim for the money back. However, they tell me with the terms and conditions they I signed off on it states they are only responsible for the transfer. I would have to press criminal charges against the person to get my money back. Now when I question the presidents office : I asked : You were aware that you were putting your consumers in danger by possibly aiding a theft? He told me he was aware that they were putting there consumers in danger. I still dont have my XXXX back, I feel they are making up excuses as usual. I spoke to XXXX as well and they told me multiple times the bank is responsible for me getting my money back but as usual Wells Fargo takes no responsibility"

We recently received email communications from the same fraudulent source that initiated the fraudulent wire transfer on XX/XX/XXXX requesting further funds to be wire transferred to them through another Wells Fargo account. It appears that after the efforts made by me and my bank ( XXXX  ) to work with Wells Fargo and advise Wells Fargo that their procedures and system for opening and administering bank accounts is weak and is empowering criminals to use them for fraudulent activities, Wells Fargo has done nothing to improve their policies and procedures in this regard. I would strongly suggest that the XXXX who regulates Wells Fargo take away their ability to do wire transfers until this problem is corrected. 

Note below, the email and attachment received from "" XXXX XXXX '' from "" XXXX '' requesting funds to be sent to Wells Fargo account. The actual person is someone from Top Sign Service. How and why can he set up a Wells Fargo account? Why does Wells Fargo allow wire transfers to go through unchecked?"

I just received my paycheck a couple days prior and knew that I had money in my bank account. I have a joint account under my mother, but she does not know my pin and I have never given my pin to anyone else. I looked at my bank account to see it was essentially cleared out with maybe a couple dollars in my savings and a negative balance in my checking account. My bank account had several unauthorized charges by mainly this XXXX person/company. {$1700.00} was moved from my savings into my checking account and the XXXX purchases were extracted from my checking in smaller amounts of {$50.00}, {$100.00}, and {$200.00}. I had class and had to go to work immediately after so I was not able to call my bank ( Wells Fargo ) until the day afterwards. 

XX/XX/2022 : I called and they essentially told me that I would have to make several claims because of the different kinds of bank transfers and that my money would be reimbursed. They closed my checking account reopened another checking account and a couple days later I received an email apologizing for the fraudulent activity happening on the account that I had just opened instead of the one that was closed. They told me to wait 7 days for my new card. 

XX/XX/2022 : I called Wells Fargo to get an update on my claims because I had not been reimbursed yet for the XXXX. One was resolved but I was still charged with overdraft fees and was told that my other claim has been closed and resolved, the claim regarding all of the XXXX charges. Ultimately, they said my claim was denied and that I will not receiving any of that money back. I have chatted with Wells Fargo agents online and they tell me to contact the Claims department, but the Claims department said there was not enough evidence for my case even though they contacted me about the suspicious activity."

2023,"My husband and I were looking at renting a house around XX/XX/2018. We contacted the person on the ad, filled out a renters application, and lease, and he asked us to send the money via wire transfer since we both banked at Wells Fargo..

We went to our local branch, talked to the teller and he handled the transaction. We never left the bank, never touched the money, have the receipt, and all the other person 's information. A couple days later, the "" landlord '' of the new property asked us for an HOA fee, and that's what made us step back and start making phone calls to verify things.

Come to find out, there was no HOA for the neighborhood the house was in, and no one had any information on or about the person we were talking to. After discovering that info, we called the bank, filed the claim with them, went to our branch to talk with the branch manager, filed police report, and every other thing the bank had asked us to do. The branch manager said that since we did everything that was asked, and gave her a copy of all the info we had about the situation and person committing the crime, that she would put a note in our account to allow us to have our money back. 

That was a month ago, and now all we are getting from Wells Fargo customer service reps, investigators, and supervisors is "" It sucks to be you, and we refuse to help in any way. '' Our bank who we have been with for almost 5 years is doing nothing to help us, acts like we do not matter, and the suporvisor 's are extremely rude when we talk with them over the phone.

It was removed by a Wells Fargo money transfer system called "" XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. I did not request or set up. Wells Fargo XXXX account. I did not transfer any money to anyone. Wells Fargo investigated and determined that I authorized these transfers. I never heard of XXXX until I was scammed. Wells Fargo allowed this to happen without my knowledge. I'm a XXXX veteran and XXXX XXXX XXXX and {$1500.00} is a lot of money to me especially in these times. I notified Wells Fargo fraud department immediately when I saw the transfers. Wells Fargo says it will take 30 days to send me the paper work stating what their investigation revealed. I don't believe Wells Fargo made much of an attempt to investigate this problem since this isn't much money to them. 
I can't understand how Wells Fargo sets up programs, without a persons knowledge, to allow transfers of money to happen. Wells Fargo encouraged scammers or stole the money themselves."

2029,"While cleaning during the pandemic, I found an Official Check for {$1000.00} given to me by my Mother for XXXX in 2004. It was drawn on Wachovia which was acquired by Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo gave us a ticket number XXXX, but has never responded other than to say they can not help us. I have checked with the state of North Carolina unclaimed money and nothing is there in my name. I know the bank got this money and I feel they should have to honor this check. It is my understanding this kind of check is the same as cash."
2031,"I used XXXX through the Wells Fargo mobile app to transfer {$400.00} to a seller on XXXX for tickets. The seller was a scammer and never transferred the tickets. When I filed a claim with Wells Fargo, they claimed there was no redress because I authorized the transfer. 

However, there are few reasons why Wells Fargo should be responsible and reimburse me for the loss : - The XXXX function is fully integrated into the Wells Fargo app and website, which makes it look like it is part of the bank and not a third-party provider. 
- By trading on consumers ' trust and confidence in Wells Fargo, XXXX makes it seem safe to transfer funds using its service. 
- Based on this integration, a consumer would have a reasonable expectation that XXXX comes with the same consumer fraud protections that other payment methods through the bank have -- such as paying with a check, credit card, or debit card. 
- XXXX asks for the recipients name and phone number -- this makes the consumer think that the bank is checking to see if the recipient 's bank account matches the recipient 's name and phone number. But that can't be the case, because the scammer was impersonating someone. 
- Both Wells Fargo and the recipient 's bank have Anti-Money Laundering/Bank Secrecy Act requirements to "" know your customer '' but it does not seem that either bank is conducting any due diligence to ensure that the recipient is who s/he claims to be. 
- Even though I have now found many articles online warning about XXXX scams, Wells Fargo has no warning about these scams to users. If you know that a payment system is being exploited by fraudsters, you should have some information about it on your website. 

I understand that Wells Fargo views XXXX like a wire transfer and therefore they claim to have no ability to return the funds. However, I believe that Wells Fargo bears financial responsibility for hosting a payment system that is so easily exploited by criminals. Even if Wells Fargo has to pay for the refund itself, it should have to internalize the cost of the risk of scams that it exposes its customers to. The relationship that a customer has with his/her bank is totally different from the relationship with an unknown payment service provider. I would not have used XXXX if I had understood how it works and how little protection there is. 

If Wells and other banks had to take responsibility for scams through XXXX, they will have the incentive to try to stop these scams. If they refuse to take responsibility, customers will lose confidence and trust in their banks."

But then both the clerk and manager said yes u gave us cash but we gave you back after an hour of conversation. They have been changing their word so many time which I decide to record on my phone. I have that for evidence and the two identical receipt they gave me."

2041,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I used OfferUp resale app to sell my dining furniture in XXXX, NC because I am a student and needed funds to pay upcoming school fees. I listed the furniture for {$500.00} on the app. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX an account linked to someone named XXXX  responded to listing saying he was interested in the furniture and would like to send money in advance to reserve the items. We shifted communication off the app to text message XXXX XXXX  number : XXXX ). XXXX He sent {$1000.00} via e-check ( attached below ) from his financial officer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and claimed the additional {$500.00} was to pay movers who would be picking up the furniture. I deposited the check via Wells Fargo mobile ( XXXX ) and confirmed the check was cleared into my bank account. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX he then requested I send the movers money XXXX {$500.00} XXXX via XXXX to XXXX belonging to a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is a payment option offered through WellsFargo 's online banking service so I was led to believe it was safe. Per are agreement, he was to tell me the pickup time and come get the furniture. After I sent the payment, the purchaser began taking more time to respond and sending sporadic texts. The movers never arrived for the furniture. At XXXX I messaged him for an update on pickup time and he responded with a story about a family member having illness and no longer being able to get the furniture. He requested I return the remaining balance through apple pay to XXXX. When I responded I didnt have apple pay, he suggested payment through cashapp via bitcoin or a XXXX XXXXt card. I didnt feel comfortable using these methods as I had heard they were used to scam so I XXXX  the check owner on the e-check and it looked to be a shell company. I contacted my bank ( WellsFargo ) immediately and while on the phone with them, saw that the e-check Id deposited was being returned and my bank charged an additional {$12.00} for a counterfeit check. WellsFargo withdrew the funds from the bounced check on XX/XX/XXXX ( time unk ). I am now missing {$510.00} because of the money sent to the movers + the charge for the counterfeit check. While on the phone, the Wells Fargo Banker said that since the transaction happened through Wells-Fargo 's linked account to XXXX, they should be able to help me. She also recommended filing a police report as it would help my case. I filed the police report XXXX Report # XXXX ) that same evening. I have attached the counterfeit check as well as my text messages with the scammer to prove the check cleared initially. I also attached emails from the seller 's "" finance officer '' as well as WellsFargo when the check later bounced. 

I contacted Wells Fargo again on XX/XX/XXXX to submit a police report I'd filed regarding the matter. They said my claim was still processing and they would call me with an update. After not receiving said update I contacted them again on XXXX to get an update, but I was informed the claim was closed on Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX. They said they attempted to call me via phone but did not leave a voicemail. I have gone through my call history and email and have not received a single call from Wells Fargo or XXXX. The only calls I received that day were from my family and my phone was with me the entire time. I explained this to Wells Fargo and they said there is nothing they can do because it was a XXXX transaction. XXXX is not offering restitution either because they say it has to be addressed with my Bank. I have been contacting Wells Fargo since XXXX when I first filed the claim and they keep re-routing me through different departments only to not give me an answer or offer to reopen my account claim. All I want is to be able to pay my school fees and every representative I've spoken to has been callous towards my situation and unhelpful. I called Wells Fargo again for the XXXX Claims number and they routed me through different departments only to drop the call. As of now I've been in contact with their bankers from Online customer service, Debit Card Claims, ACH check claims, XXXX transactions. No one is attempting to help me."
2042,"I answered an ad for someone selling doberman puppies on XXXX on XX/XX/2020. I texted back and forth with the seller about the details about the puppies. The breeder said that the puppies will be only available in 8 weeks but he is taking deposits. He said that they will be available on XX/XX/2020. I asked him to call me which he did and we discussed the process of how the ears  will be cropped. He said that the puppies are {$1600.00} but if you pay in full early that the price drops to {$1300.00}. I asked him if I could pay him {$500.00} today and {$800.00} on the following Tuesday, he said yes but they only take payments through XXXX. I though that was not an issue since XXXX is promoted by my bank Wells Fargo and they have fraud protection. I asked the breeder for references and he said that he will send them to me shortly. I sent the breeder {$500.00} and still had not seen the references the seller told me they would send. The strange thing is the breeder had a XXXX VA area code and the ad was posted in XXXX Florida. A couple hours passed and I still did not get the references. Out of curiosity, I checked the XXXX ads in XXXX VA for doberman puppies and saw the same exact ad in XXXX VA with the same phone number. I texted the seller and still did not hear back from them. I realized that I was scammed and tried to file a dispute with my bank right away. I then found out that XXXX payments cant be disputed because I sent the money. How is this possible? Please help me get my {$500.00} back. How is there no fraud protection."
2043,"On the previous report, I stated TWO scenarios of which I attempted to clear a negotiable instrument. You all, in response to my first report, only acknowledged the attempt I made inside the branch and not the attempt I made by mail. Lets be clear : one attempt was inside a branch and another attempt was by mail. These were two separate notes with different  formatting ; and nothing I nor my legal person did was unlawful, or illegal ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. 

Inside the branch, I provided branch members a COPY of one note within the a set to be scanned over to their processor. [ The first was sent by mail and had a different format. ] He, the processor, insisted that they could not take it, which is false. I am aware of HJR 192, PL 73-10, private banking,  and the fact that I am giving the bank credit ; and that the bank does not give me ANY money. I literally create the said "" money '' myself by pledging my labor. For the record, you all absolutely DID give me back the [ copy of my ] note inside the branch. [ I did not trust you all enough to put the original of that set in your hands because I KNOW that you all steal, which is evident by this cfpb report. ] ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. 

HOWEVER, by the mail transaction I did NOT receive my instrument back. I instead received a letter saying that you all do not accept them. How is it that you do not accept them, but you did not give my instrument back? Keep in mind, I do have the registration number of the correspondence I sent ; so it is without a doubt proof, that I sent an instrument to you all and did not get it back. As a result, I logically conclude that it was stolen ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .... Also, my trade was restricted as per Title 15 of the United States Codes 1 : "" Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding {>= $1,000,000} if a corporation, or, if any other person, {>= $1,000,000}, or by imprisonment not exceeding 10 years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court. "" ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. You are dealing with a very smart man. I comprehend the acquiescence game, so I will not stay silent - at all. I do not accept your rejection. I gave you my credit and instructed you to put it in my account ; and in return, you all stole it and did not put my credit in my account. Instead, you gave me a letter acting as if the bank itself gives me credit. You don't give me anything ... .... You all are just an intermediary that facilitates transactions. Your members, however, are quite nosey and deceptive ; but you all can not trick me, nor scare me. I do not care about your corporate investigators nor any agents you may send at me ... ... ... ... ... Since you all closed my account, mail me what is mine since it can not be transferred. Thank you."

2050,"My case was closed prior to resolution so I am filing again with more information included. First is the original complaint, then my reply to the Wells Fargo Bank response with more complaints against Wells Fargo Bank as the response they provided was misleading and inaccurate - please read and compare my original complaint with that of my reply to Wells Fargo Bank. 

Compaint : Prior to sending this transfer request I checked and rechecked with Wells Fargo to confirm that I was in fact mailing them all of the required documentation needed to process my request as there are specific forms and documents that are required - they confirmed that I was in fact sending them exactly what they needed in order to process my request which included notarized written instructions from me showing my signature. A transfer request was sent by me via next day  mail to Wells Fargo with delivery confirmed on XXXX. The request was to transfer XXXX from one account and XXXX from another account into one account at a XXXX XXXX  - both accounts at Wells Fargo are in the name of my Mother who passed away on XXXX ; I am the personal representative. The background is I had full access to these accounts to help my Mother manage her finances and I am also a long time Wells Fargo customer having several active accounts with them at this time. After about 5 days I called Wells Fargo and they confirmed receipt of the required documentation and also confirmed that the documents had been scanned into their system and ready for processing. They confirmed that it would take about 20 days to process. After about 20 days I called and they said it would take a little longer perhaps 30 days from date of receipt to process. I waited and called again after about 30 days and they said it would be processed within one week of my phone call. I called back after about one week and they said they needed me to fill out form W-9 and mail it back to them and that they would then be able to complete my request ( I was not previuosly informed by Wells Fargo that this form was actually a requirement even after checking and rechecking with them ). I confirmed that the requested W-9 form was delivered to Wells Fargo on XXXX at which time I ask them when my requested transactions would take place and the Rep stated it would take another 24 days. Based on the response so far I have no confidence that my requested transactions will be processed after another 24 days of waiting. Furthermore, on a personal note this is particularly cruel to hold me XXXX by not performing the requested very simple, everyday transactions ; especially after the passing of my Mother and the fact that I have funeral expenses to pay from these particular funds. To add insult to injury, I am the one that recommended to my Mother that she put her life savings into Wells Fargo accounts.

My reply to the Wells Fargo Bank Response : Thank you for your response and this opportunity to elaborate further on my complaint against Wells Fargo Bank. Below please find excerpts from your response with my commentary for each excerpt : At Wells Fargo, we pride ourselves on developing and maintaining quality financial relationships and strive to consistently deliver the exemplary service we know our customers deserve. We want to let you know that our intent is to provide hassle free service to all customers with the most professional, courteous and efficient customer assistance possible. It is important to know that trust, privacy and maintaining our customers confidence are important to Wells Fargo, and we want customers to be confident that their relationships with Wells Fargo are treated appropriately. 

I have not, in any way, received exemplary service from Wells Fargo Bank, nor has my experience been hassle free ; I have completely lost confidence in Wells Fargo Bank. While I will say that several of the customer service representatives I have talked to since early XXXX have been very nice, this brings me to several valid points that Wells Fargo Bank should try to understand : 1. Wells Fargo Bank has not assigned a dedicated representative to my case. 2. Wells Fargo Bank has not provided me with an email contact. 3. Each time I have called Wells Fargo Bank about my case I have been connected to a different  customer service representative, and my case information and timeline is not available to them, and each time I have a question the customer service representative I am speaking with has to put me on hold and call someone else at Wells Fargo Bank to try to find the answer. I contrast my experience with Wells Fargo Bank with that of another financial institution I have been dealing with for a similar type of transaction, which they accomplished in a timely and professional manner : 1. I was provided with a representative that personally handled my case. 2. The representative provided me with a direct line phone number and an email. 3. The representative was able to answer all of my questions immediately and was thoroughly familiar with all of the requirements, implications and scenarios and other pertinent aspects. 

We understand you were transferring the funds from the accounts for XXXX to your account at XXXX XXXX  since you are the Power of Attorney on those accounts. However, the Power of Attorney is terminated on the date of the principals death.

This is a clear misrepresentation of what I actually and factually stated in my complaint to Wells Fargo Bank here is the exact quotation from my complaint : ... I am the personal representative. The background is I had full access to these accounts to help my Mother manage her finances and I am also a long time Wells Fargo customer having several active accounts with them at this time ... Why Wells Fargo Bank is so flagrantly misrepresenting what I said in my complaint is very troubling. My wording is clear : I am the personal representative which is the same as  the executor for the estate of my Mother this is a legal designation conferred by the Probate Court. The meaning my wording was conveying is that I am a long time customer of Wells Fargo Bank, so if Wells Fargo Bank was to look up my history, perhaps that would make things easier for both Wells Fargo Bank and myself ( I used Wells Fargo Bank, my former employer used Wells Fargo Bank, my Mother used Wells Fargo Bank ). 

We understand you were transferring the funds from the accounts for XXXX to your account at XXXX XXXX since you are the Power of Attorney on those accounts. However, the Power of Attorney is terminated on the date of the principals death. Our records show that on XX/XX/2020, you spoke to our XXXX XXXX representative and were informed that we received the Notice of Death document. You were also requested to provide the W-9 and the EIN ( Employee Identification number ) to complete this process. We understand you mailed these documents and received a conformation that they were delivered. The XXXX XXXX XXXX representative called you on XX/XX/2020, and were unable to reach you. Since, we did not receive these documents please provide the tracking number for these documents to the XXXX XXXX XXXX by contacting them at ... 

Again my wording is misrepresented. I am not requesting this transaction as Power of Attorney. Let me make this clear : As stated in my complaint I am the personal representative which is the same as the executor for the estate of my Mother this is a legal designation conferred by the Probate Court. Then the Wells Fargo Bank response states that I was informed that they had received the Notice of Death - this is a false statement by Wells Fargo Bank as the representative I was speaking to at the time was unable to provide me with any information at all about my case in fact I am the one who provided the representative with the background information and timeline, and told the representative that all of the required documents had been scanned in for processing by Wells Fargo Bank back in XXXX as told to me by a different Wells Fargo Bank representative. Also note : I actually stated at a XXXX XXXX  not at XXXX XXXX   You were also requested to provide the W-9 and the EIN ( Employee Identification Number ) to complete this process. We understand you mailed these documents and received a conformation that they were  delivered. The XXXX XXXX XXXX representative called you on XX/XX/2020, and were unable to reach you. Since, we did not receive these documents please provide the tracking number for these documents ... 

I am flabbergasted. When I sent the original set of requested documents to Wells Fargo Bank Wells Fargo Bank was unable to find the documents without the tracking number, so I gave it to them so they could find it. Both mailings were sent Priority Mail with tracking numbers and confirmed as delivered to Wells Fargo Bank, however in both instances Wells Fargo Bank is unable to find mailed documents unless they have a tracking number which tells me Wells Fargo Bank has no system in place, no way to inventory mail and deliver inter-office to the appropriate department. Having said that I will call and provide Wells Fargo Bank with the tracking number if that will help Wells Fargo Bank complete my transfer request. 

We are truly sorry for the frustration and inconvenience this matter has caused you. 

Thank you for the apology however customers do not want apologies, they want action, consideration, professionalism and honesty - especially for something as simple as a transfer request. 

I am submitting this to the CFPB so that my complaint will stay open until actually resolved as the above is now submitted as one complaint letter."

Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX -- I visited Wells Fargo XXXX branch and spoke to an XXXX branch banker about my deposited check on hold. After the branch banker reached out to another Wells Fargo representative by phone, the branch banker shared that the Wells Fargo representative on the phone said the deposited check was flagged as fraudulent. The banker told me to wait for a few days for any changes or corrects, and if nothing changes, to reach out to Wells Fargo. 

Friday XX/XX/XXXX -- I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating the check was on hold and its been confirmed as fraudulent. I called Wells Fargo customer service line and spoke to someone name XXXX  in executive services department. XXXX stated someone from XXXX XXXX XXXX, the financial institution that issued the cashiers check, confirmed the check was fraudulent.

I called Fraud Loss Mitigation and spoke to XXXX XXXX with the title of Financial Crime Specialist and asked to speak to XXXX. XXXX was adamant about helping and ignored my request to speak to XXXX, who I was told in an earlier conversation, was working on my case, to ask for. Throughout the entire conversation, XXXX was confrontational, dismissive, and disrespectful. XXXX also stated that whoever told me to call back to ask for a particular person gave me misinformation. XXXX than quickly transferred me to a random supervisor, whom he admitted he wouldnt know who it would be. I would think XXXX would brief the supervisor or manager on my case before transferring. XXXX refused to reach out to XXXX XXXX XXXX directly or would check to confirm a proof of payment letter was sent, saying it would take over 20 minutes for them to receive it and he wouldnt see because it is too late. 

SaturdayXX/XX/XXXX I call Wells Fargo Fraud Loss Mitigation to confirm if they received proof of payment letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX, and spoke to another fraud crime specialist named XXXX, whom stated they received it but said its not sufficient because its not notarized she needs a proof of issuance letter as well. I tried explaining to XXXX that I was not told of this extra information needed and I also was unsure if there was specific information she needed to release my money. Throughout this entire interaction, XXXX was very rude, disrespectful, dismissive, and refuse to give me sufficient information. I also asked if she can call XXXX XXXX XXXX directly to confirm or tell XXXX XXXX XXXX exactly what to produce so that Wells Fargo can release my money. XXXX said she can not call to confirm, she said I am not understanding her and said she will transfer me to someone that can better explain it to me, and than quickly transferred me. 

I followed up with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Branch Manager XXXX XXXX, whose based at the branch that issued the cashiers check to my mother, and he was confused as to why Wells Fargo flagged the in-state cashiers check as fraud, why Wells Fargo made claims of being unsuccessful pulling funds from XXXX XXXX XXXX when it shows on his end the funds were pulled XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo claiming theyve never received a cashiers check similar to the one I deposited when its XXXX XXXX XXXX  normal cashiers check, and a deposit I made XX/XX/XXXX with a similar cashiers check for {$6000.00} ( check # XXXX ) and did not have issues, and Wells Fargos fraud investigators refusal to call XXXX XXXX XXXX to confirm, give additional information, or call the XXXX Branch Manager directly to confirm or accept the checks trace number ( XXXX ). 

After another attempt to Wells Fargo Fraud Loss Mitigation department, I was connected with XXXX, who was very polite, professional, and confirmed Wells Fargo received the proof of payment letter. XXXX confirmed the signed proof of payment letter with XXXX XXXX XXXX branch manager XXXX XXXX, and quickly released my funds. XXXX also transferred me to XXXX XXXX in Wells Fargo Executive Office to file a complaint.

This ordeal caused me to lose great trust and confidence in Wells Fargo, due to how Wells Fargo specialist treated me. I was scared and felt helpless, hopeless, powerless, and believed Wells Fargo stole my money. Much information that was shared with me by XXXX XXXX representatives and so called financial crime specialist during this very stressful ordeal was very poor, scattered, and no one seemed to have clear and concise information. No customer should ever have to deal with what Ive endured. 

Ive banked with Wells Fargo for many years and now I am highly considering moving to another financial institution and closing all of my Wells Fargo accounts and cutting all ties with Wells Fargo. I do not feel I can trust Wells Fargo to protect me and my money."
2069,"On Tuesday, XX/XX/2021 monies from Illinois unemployment that was scheduled to post into my bank account was instead transfered into a Wells Fargo account. I have never banked with this banking institution, so I am confused as to why a deposit with my name can go into an account that does not have my name on it."
2071,"Hello, so this not about a specific company per say, but an individual who claims they can give you more money than what you paid ( ie pay {$100.00} and get {$500.00} ). I paid him over XXXX with my Wells Fargo account with 4 separate payments of {$200.00}, {$100.00}, and {$200.00}, on XX/XX/2020 and {$250.00} on XX/XX/2020. Not only did he promise me immediate results ( how Id be able to get {$4000.00} by only paying {$300.00} ) he kept making me pay more and more under the guise that Id get my money back. He never gave me my money back and said he couldnt and never gave me anything at all. His XXXX is XXXX ( I also have many more screenshots of the conversation if needed )"
2072,"My boyfriend and I were scammed out of a dog, I send XXXX from my XXXX  account and he send XXXX from his account. I tried to get my XXXX back through XXXX, filed a police report and reported it as scam and fraud and XXXX still refused to give me my money back."
2073,On XX/XX/XXXX I zelled over XXXX expecting a product. I was previously under the assumption that I had been scammed because he wouldnt get back to me but he got back to me recently saying that he never received the payment even though the money went out of my account so he didnt send over the product I was supposed to receive. I dont know the legitimacy of his claim but if this is is true I dont know why my money went out.
2075,"In XX/XX/2020 I have received two transaction from my client in XXXX, XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$470.00} and {$320.00} ( attached ). However the sending XXXX XXXX routed the transactions through its affiliate Wells Fargo while disguising the international origin of the wire transactions ( violation of the Patriot Act II ) .. What was received on the end was {$50.00} less for both transactions as the XXXX XXXX XXXX disguised any fees charged to both my client and me and the transactions arrived as {$450.00} and {$290.00} respectively without any proper transaction routing and fee listing disclosures. What bank is doing is not only unethical but illegal and it must be stopped as this type of practice also encourages money laundering and complete lack of accountability/transparency. XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo refused to answer any questions regarding this transaction."
2077,"I came across with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX  and get {$400.00} per week I fill up all my information weeks later I got a check over the mail for XXXX sane that XXXX needs to go today XXXX XXXX XXXX I deposit through XXXX {$500.00} in their account and then I realize that its scam, he pushes me to go and do a money order and send it to them via overnight mail then I realize that its a scam I called XXXX XXXX right away and try to stop the transaction I file a claim and XXXX XXXX just sent me XXXX XXXX XXXX that same they can not credit me back I wanted to see if someone can please help me Im unemployed right now and I thought that its gon na be nice to make an extra money I cant believe I fell into a scam"

XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. He told me to put void transactions in the memo field so the bank will know that it not a valid transaction. I sent 3 transactions through XXXX  and it was received. He told me that I would get my money back within 30 min. I was suspicious so I called the bank and filed a fraud complaint. I placed a complaint with the bank asking for a courtesy refund. They declined the request. I filed another complaint to the executive office and they declined my request. I am a single mother and I used all of my money that I had in my account. I have filed a police report, I have filed a complaint with the OCC, CID Cybercrimes, IC3.GOV. I am asking that a bank Wellsfargo that I have entrusted and have been loyal to for 30 years grant me a courtesy."

I have visited the same branch to trace or track where my money is, as my uncle has not received these funds. XXXX tried to contact their XXXX customer support but always they would give a Case Number and told us that they will put this case on high priority but I have not received any progress and my uncle has not received these funds.

2086,"This statement is regarding fraud that I experienced that put an undue financial burden on me. On XX/XX/2021 I checked my Wells Fargo Mobile app at approximately XXXX XXXX and I noticed two fraudulent charges ( one for {$99.00} in XXXX, FL and one {$14.00} XXXX XXXX charge ). I have never authorized anyone else to use my card at any point in time and I have no ties to any part of Florida, so I knew they were fraudulent. At XXXX XXXX, I received a text message ( from XXXX ) asking if I authorized an attempted {$450.00} charge at XXXX. I said no. At XXXX XXXX, I called Wells Fargo, dialing the number that is on the back of my debit card ( XXXX ). I spent a little over a minute on hold when I saw the same Wells Fargo number I dialed ( XXXX ) calling me at XXXX. I answered, and the man on the phone identified himself as a Wells Fargo employee and he addressed me by name before I introduced myself. He offered an employee ID number and said he was on a recorded line. He said he was calling about fraud on my account. He proceeded to list off personal information of mine such as my bank account numbers and my address, along with my first and last name. He then proceeded to ask me about charges on my debit card, asking me to confirm whether charges were legitimate or not. He was able to reference legitimate charges as well as the fraudulent ones I listed above. I do not know how he would have been able to see all of that if he were not a Wells Fargo employee. He told me he was going to send me a new debit card in the mail, asked if my address was still the same, I said no and I gave him my updated address. He then asked me if I had authorized charges on XXXX for {$2500.00} and {$1000.00}. I said no because I had not. He said that since the charges were still pending, I would not see them in the app. He said that the only way to reverse them would be to XXXX myself the money and that would cancel it out. He had me input my own email address into the recipient field. I had no reason to believe something with my email would go anywhere but to my own account. He said that since XXXX was a third-party app that this is how they chose to do things, which was different from debit fraud. Once I sent the money, I received an email from XXXX XXXX saying my money had been deposited in a XXXX XXXX Checking  account ending in ****. I do not have, and have never had, a XXXX XXXX account. Within a second of receiving the email, he hung up on me and I knew I had been defrauded. I immediately called the legitimate Wells Fargo, filed a police report, filed a report with the FTC, and filed a report with the FBI 's IC3. 
Wells Fargo did not take basic security precautions to prevent this from happening. Someone clearly accessed my bank account on another device which is how they were able to read off my personal information. On sites like XXXX and XXXX, if my account is accessed from a device I have never used before, I receive push notifications and emails on my device. Wells Fargo did nothing of the sort. Why is my social media more secure than my bank? I also did not receive notice of any kind that my XXXX information was now tied to a different bank account. Additionally, on XXXX XXXX XXXX 's mobile banking app, they offer a warning that XXXX will never ask you to XXXX yourself and that this is a scam. Why does Wells Fargo not take this basic precaution? 
I have spent a collective total of over 14 hours on the phone with Wells Fargo and they say the transactions were authorized. 
I told a Wells Fargo employee that according to CFPB 's Regulation E, these transactions were considered unauthorized and they are still refusing to reimburse the money. 
From CFPB 's website : Yes. As discussed in Electronic Fund Transfers Error Resolution : Unauthorized Fund Transfers Question 1, Regulation E defines an unauthorized EFT as an EFT from a consumers account initiated by a person other than the consumer without actual authority to initiate the transfer and from which the consumer receives no benefit. 12 CFR 1005.2 ( m ). Comment 1005.2 ( m ) -3 explains further that an unauthorized EFT includes a transfer initiated by a person who obtained the access device from the consumer through fraud or robbery. Similarly, when a consumer is fraudulently induced into sharing account access information with a third party, and a third party uses that information to make an EFT from the consumers account, the transfer is an unauthorized EFT under Regulation E.

For example, the Bureau is aware of the following situations where a third party has fraudulently obtained a consumers account access information, and thus, are considered unauthorized EFTs under Regulation E : ( 1 ) a third-party calling the consumer and pretending to be a representative from the consumers financial institution and then tricking the consumer into providing their account login information, texted account confirmation code, debit card number, or other information that could be used to initiate an EFT out of the consumers account, and ( 2 ) a third party using phishing or other methods to gain access to a consumers computer and observe the consumer entering account login information. EFTs stemming from these situations meet the Regulation E definition of unauthorized EFTs."

We are trying to help him and being generous but at end it was a scam. They are doing fraud and scam so they can get money. Is it possible to get the money back because I tried to reverse the ACH before because they told us before we can reverse it unfortunately they informed as in the branch we cant reverse it. He never respond to my text or call. XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX {$1500.00} XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX {$250.00}"
2088,"Wells Fargo has allowed for the creation of scam/fraudulent accounts. I fell victim to a wiring scam on XX/XX/2021 for my housing down payment where the beneficiary account ( scammer ) had a Wells Fargo account. The scammer was able to make an account with the same name as my attorney even though that's not their real name. Wells Fargo also accepted a wire to an account where the account details did not match up exactly. Wells Fargo has delayed freezing the funds in the scam account, which decreases XXXX  XXXX XXXX ability to recall the wire. Wells Fargo has allowed for the creation of scam accounts under fake names and has caused delays in getting the money back to the victim of a scam."
2089,"There was an international wire transfer initiated in the XXXX that was sent via XXXX to Wells Fargo that was supposed to be sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

2104,"Currently I am residing in XXXX and have a savings account with Wells Fargo in the USA that has a significant credit. Given the effect of CORONA of reducing the availability of work opportunities, I now need to use most of that money. Since from XX/XX/2020, I have unsuccessfully been in communication with Wells Fargo, to get access to my money. More recently I have requested that Wells Fargo do an International Wire Transfer to my XXXX XXXX  account and Wells Fargo has refused. Although I have given them my instructions through their Secure messaging System, they have still refused to activate a wire transfer. Their CSR has unreasonably suggested that I return from XXXX to the USA to effect the wire transfer. 
Although I have formally complained, the bank has still not agreed to send my funds to my XXXX XXXX  account through an International Wire Transfer. 

My issues with Wells Fargo bank started long before XX/XX/2020 when various other CSRs were involved. However, I started making notes from around the end of XX/XX/2020. There were many CSRs involved before the matter was passed up to their Enterprise Complaints Management Office. The first person in that office who contacted me was XXXX XXXX who allocated the following Wells Fargo Case ID : XXXX. She stated that they needed 10 working days before responding to me. Although I had tried communicating with her soon after the 10 Days were over, I didnt receive a response. 

Having again written my complaint to Wells Fargo on XXXX XX/XX/2020, about not being able to get my money wired to me, they again undertook to respond to me within 10 Business days. However, I did not receive a response from the bank till XXXX XX/XX/2020. This was only after I had again called them and first spoke to Ms XXXX XXXX who, about 20 minutes into our conversation, then passed me on to Mr XXXX XXXX to whom I again explained the whole situation. He said that the bank did not have systems in place to help me while outside the US and suggested I fly back to the US. As I recognize the benefits of the bank using a XXXX  to send my money to my local XXXX XXXX, which is XXXX XXXX with a XXXX  code of : XXXX. In my conversation with Mr. XXXX, he acknowledged that XXXX  codes are for international transfer, but seemed not to be able to accept that I was asking for an international transfer from the USA to the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Ordinarily, banks do this through a Corresponding bank. Hence, I discussed with him that there was no real need for me to fly back to the USA, given these options. 

I then got a letter from Ms XXXX XXXX dated XXXX XXXX ( Copy attached ). In this letter Ms. XXXX principally wrote about accessing the funds using an ATM card. I subsequently found out that that ATM pathway would have been exceedingly costly. Unfortunately, in her letter, Ms XXXX had not address my request for an International Wire Transfer. I subsequently tried calling Ms. XXXX during the working hours that she had notified me of, but was not able to get through to her. So, I wrote to her on XXXX XX/XX/2020 XXXX copy attached ) : Unfortunately, I have not ever received a response from Wells Fargo to my communication. 

Over the duration of my various communications with Wells Fargo, there was also a second Wells Fargo Case ID numbers that is : XXXX As you are no doubt aware, on XXXX XXXX, I spend an inordinate amount of time on a very costly international call, speaking with firstly Ms XXXX XXXX and then later with Mr XXXX XXXX trying to determine how I could access my funds."
2108,I tried to send money to my brother through XXXX to pay for the car note since it was the fastest way. This was my first time using XXXX through Wells Fargo and there was nothing stating that you couldn't get your money back if you sent it. The transaction was on the XXXX of XXXX. XXXX asked for my brother 's number and his first and last name ( XXXX XXXX  ) .Turns out my brother gave me the wrong number ( XXXX ) which I zelled the money to. My brothers number is XXXX. We realized it was the wrong number after the fact. We called on the XXXX since we thought XXXX had a wait time. We filed a claim and we didn't hear back until the XXXX. Wells Fargo stated that they couldn't do anything about it at all. I've tried contacting the person that my brother sent it to but got told that they didn't know what XXXX was. My question is why does wells Fargo and all the other big banks use XXXX if it's not secure. Wells Fargo didn't say that XXXX was said and done no matter what when I first pulled it up. Is there anything I can do to get my XXXX $ back?
2109,"Requesting assistance getting {$15000.00} from a cashiers check I put a stop payment on with Wells Fargo Bank. 

XXXX-I got a Cashiers check to pay off my mortgage with XXXX XXXX XXXX. Due to not having the account number on the cashiers check ( it was recommended by XXXX to cancel the cashiers check ). The cashiers check was stopped on XX/XX/2020 and was told I would have to wait 45 days to get the cashiers check reissues or reimbursed. 

XXXX-I received a certified letter from XXXX indicating the cashiers check was dishonored by Wells Fargo and alerting me to make my payment within 30 days. I called Wells Fargo at this time I was informed I would have now have to wait 90 days to get the money reimbursed. 

XXXX-I made a wire transfer from Wells Fargo to XXXX with the payoff amount : {$15000.00}. I was charged {$30.00} for this transaction. 

XXXX sent me my home title a few weeks later. After 90 days I called Wells Fargo asking for my money. On XX/XX/2020 I sent an email to XXXX XXXX, Personal Banker II. I communicated with him by phone and email, several times. I was asked to get a legal copy of the cancelled cashiers check since XXXX attampted the deposit. I called XXXX and was given verbal confirmation that the check was destroyed. 

XXXX I called XXXX and was informed XXXX is no longer operational and were unable to provide me with any further documentation. 

XXXX-I informed Mr. XXXX XXXX is no longer in operation. ( Copies of communication with Mr. XXXX will be included ). Mr. XXXX responded to the email and ccd XXXX XXXX, Branch Manager. A complaint on my behalf was opened. 
I received a call from Wells Fargo but felt uncomfortable and didnt verify my identity with the caller over the phone. 

XX/XX/2020 I set up an appointment with Mr. XXXX for XX/XX/2020. 

XX/XX/2020 @ XXXX I went to Wells Fargo on XXXX XXXX. Mr. XXXX informed me I would be charged .01 % fee, then he went to see the manager and said I would be charged fee of 2.2 % to get my money back. He went to meet with the manager, I was left waiting for over 30 minutes and I told the secretary I wasnt feeling well and left. 

XXXX-Several other emails with Mr. XXXX. 
Another claim was done with the corporate office resolution specialist. I was contacted and was told I would have to wait 3 yrs before I could get my money back. 

They requested I have a copy of the cashiers check and I showed them the letter from XXXX that the cashiers check they tried to process was dishonored and gave them a phone number to call to get verbal confirmation that the check was destroyed. They still told me I had to have a copy of the cashiers check from XXXX, THIS IS SOMETHING WELLS FARGO SHOULD HAVE ON FILE SINCE XXXX RAN THE CASHIERS CHECK AND THERE IS ALWAYS IMAGES CAPTURED OF ALL CHECKS THAT ARE PROCESSED. 

No written documentation of any clause or laws related to why they are entitled to hold my money or why they have the right charge me to have my money returned to me. Cashiers checks are not valid over 180 days and its been well over 180 days. As per Wells Fargos policy I should have had the cashiers check refunded or reissued. On the Cashiers check receipt it states, If this instrument is lost, stolen, or destroyed, you may request cancelation and reissuance. 

Attached are the following documents : 1. Receipt of purchase of cashiers check 2. Letter from  XXXX stating the cashiers check WAS dishonored from Wells Fargo.

3. Written communication of cases I opened with Wells Fargo and emails with personal bankers."
2110,"So I was looking to rent an apartment online. I found this guy from a social media platform. I was supposed to get a studio apartment. He told me to send him an advance deposit because he might not be able to hold the apartment for me until the week I was free to come visit. I was in desperate need of an apartment and didnt want to lose that chance. So I sent him {$500.00} through my bank using XXXX on XX/XX/2020. Then as I was ready to visit the apartment, I contacted him and he told me he was busy and that I shouldnt be bothering him. So I asked what does that mean. He told me I was annoying and that he wont be renting his place to me anymore. Then I told him okay then can I get a refund for my money. He never responded after that. He blocked me and Ive no other way of contacting him. I called my bank right away, they opened an investigation, then closed it after couple of days because they do not see this as a scam. I dont know what else to do."
2111,"On XX/XX/2021, around XXXX XXXX, I noticed emails that informed me I had sent a wire transfer of {$4500.00} to an unknown recipient and a XXXX transfer for {$990.00} to another unknown recipient. I rushed down to my bank to have them reverse the transfers, as I never authorized them, I'm guessing my computer was hacked and somehow the hackers got into my online banking. Instead of immediately freezing my account and calling the banks where the transfers went to, the banker told me it didn't work that way and proceeded to call the Wells Fargo fraud team who assured me they would look into the fraud. They were fairly indifferent about how serious this was to me and took 8 days to complete their investigation, and finally sent me letters indicating that the wire transfers were not fraud, that I myself or someone I authorized, made the transfers and there was no way I was getting my money back. Talk about a slap in the face, all this from a bank that has been accused of fraud itself the past few years for opening fraudulent accounts under their customers names! Please see the attachments I have uploaded to you for all the details. Thanks"
2112,"I filed my taxes through XXXX on XX/XX/2016. My total refund was {$1200.00}, but after paying my fees for filing, I ended up getting roughly {$1200.00} back as a refund. When I noticed the money hadnt been deposited into my account after several weeks, I contacted Wells Fargo, who then told me to contact the IRS. The IRS investigated it and told me to contact the bank they use to deposit funds into bank accounts. Meanwhile, I am still trying to get Wells Fargo to help me out. So the IRS and the bank they use as a middleman both did their part, but Wells Fargo did not. Ultimately what happened was, I used the number off of a check that Wells Fargo assigned to me and put that as my account number and routing number. A check that was given to me should be associated with my accounts. As it turns out, my refund went into another bankers account. Now I have contacted Wells Fargo several times about this and nobody is doing anything to get my money into my account. No action or responsibility was taken by or has been taken by Wells Fargo."
2116,"On XX/XX/2021 the fraudulent wire transfer was made on my account for {$5000.00} on Wells Fargo checking account. I filed a complain immediately with my bank to cancel the transfer and reverse the amount. They told me to wait for 10 business days to get my money back from bank. But after 10 business days they said that they the case is closed and they weren't able to reverse the amount. Although when I signed the contract with Wells Fargo while opening my account it was clearly stated that I won't be responsible for any fraudulent charges. Also when I filed the complain about the unauthorised wire transfer, the banker at that time told me I'll get the refund back within 10 business days. Since I am not responsible for unauthorised charges I want them to refund my {$5000.00} back."
2117,"In XX/XX/2016 I purchased a computer via XXXX. The computer arrived broken and I returned it for a full refund. Between the time I returned the computer and the time the refund was issued I cancelled my account with Wells Fargo. I reached out to XXXX  to change the destination of my refund, but was told that the refund had already been processed with Wells Fargo. I received an Email detailing the refund on the XX/XX/XXXX, but when I reached out to Wells Fargo they repeatedly denied having received the refund. Throughout my repeated attempts to resolve the issue each company suggested that the other was at fault. I eventually lost access to my Wells Fargo account due to my cancellation of my account ( which I cancelled due to repeated undisclosed charges to my account ) so I was unable to see any further messages from Wells Fargo, who eventually marked my complaints as solved and stopped responding to my inquiries about the situation."

A confirmation number of the transfer was sent to my fathers phone number from XXXX   XXXX XXXX. My father not having the funds in his account contacted me to follow up. I contacted Wells Fargo and reported the funds were not received by my father at XXXX XXXX and that he received a notice from XXXX XXXX XXXX confirming the transfer. Wells Fargo said they would investigate. My father received a phone call on his cellphone in the next couple of days from XXXX  XXXX XXXX indicating that there was fraudulent activity on the account. When he contacted XXXX  XXXX XXXX they told him that they could not discuss the matter with him as he had no account there. Wells Fargo sent me a letter about 2 weeks later stating that they had completed the transfer as asked and disclaimed all responsibility in the transaction. In fact the person who I talked to on the phone after receiving the letter indicated that "" I had to learn the hard way on how to deal with XXXX. Wells Fargo claimed that the name on the XXXX XXXX XXXX account and the cellphone matched so they were absolved of any responsibility. Apparently there is no verification of the name on the account by XXXX upon transfers. XXXX XXXX XXXX refuses to confirm the identity of the individual whose account the funds were transferred into as well. Meanwhile I am stuck out {$870.00} for transferring funds to my father whose cellphone was on him and has received all the confirmations of the transfer as some random party was given the funds."
2119,"At XXXX ( CST ) on XX/XX/2021 I received a text message from ( XXXX ) XXXX that stated "" Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX We declined {$2000.00} with card ending XXXX at XXXX XXXX Was this you? Reply YES or NO. If yes, you will not be charged unless you try again. If no, we will close your current card and send you a new one. Msg & data rates may ap. '' At XXXX ( CST ) on XX/XX/2021 I was called from ( XXXX ) XXXX from a person claiming to be the Wells Fargo XXXX Department XXXX She said she was calling in regards to a potential fraudulent charge on my account regarding the {$2000.00} spend at XXXX XXXX Florida. Since I am a Minnesota resident they were calling to verify the charge. I told her that I did not authorize that charge. She asked whether I had the card on me, I said yes. She then said Wells Fargo would be sending me a replacement card. She said she was going to start the work to lock my account in order to prevent future fraud and move the assets to a new account. At XXXX ( CST ) I received a text message from XXXX that said my password had been changed. I asked the women on the phone about the text message and she said that was her making sure no one could access my account and asked what I wanted as a temporary password. At XXXX ( CST ) and XXXX ( CST ) I received two text messages from XXXX with two codes. I did not know what these codes were for. They said DON'T share it. I told the woman on the phone I would not provide the codes as they said do not share. At XXXX ( CST ) I received a text message from XXXX with a code to verify my identity. The women on the phone asked for the code so she could take appropriate steps in my account. I gave her the code ( it did not say do not share ) and then was locked out of my account. At this time I hung up and re-called the same number back ( XXXX ) XXXX and was directed to the actual Wells Fargo XXXX Department. That woman that answered said although this was the correct number to call in and report fraud they do not make calls from that number, which was unknown to me until that time. I told her that before I was locked out I could see a pending {$25000.00} wire transfer that I did not authorize. She put me on hold and told me she was calling the receiving bank to notify them of the fraud and freeze the wire. Apparently that was not a true statement as I received a letter from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2021 stating the money was gone and it was my fault and the money would not be refunded to me. I have since called and spoke with the Wells Fargo investigator ( XXXX XXXX ) who said that they can't freeze wires and since they were able to initiate the wire it was pretty much my fault. I did not authorize Wells Fargo to wire that money. I did not approve of the authentication process they used. The XXXX said he would reopen the claim, but I do not trust that Wells Fargo will do anything about it. My Wells Fargo claim # is XXXX. I have also filed a police report ( # XXXX ) with the XXXX XXXX, Minnesota police department. They said there was nothing they could do. 

The only information I can see regarding the transaction is : XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX # XXXX. Wells Fargo has not been overly helpful in providing information or resolving this issue."
2120,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a text message warning from Wells Fargo stating that my card had been declined at XXXX and to type Y if this charge is correct and N if the charge was not authorized. I typed N and was immediately called by an agent. The person verified my name and phone number, which is linked to my online account at Wells Fargo. The agent asked me to provide the credentials for my Wells Fargo XXXX account to prevent unauthorized XXXX transfers. Once the agent verified my information, they initiated a XXXX XXXX transactions, each for {$500.00}. The reason the person gave me was to reverse fraudulent XXXX transactions. The agent took {$3500.00} from my account. Simultaneously, my husband received the same text but was in a different city. He did not respond, but called Wells Fargo, who denied any fraud occurring on the account. Apparently the thieves knew our names, phone numbers and bank. My husband texted me while I was speaking to the imposter bank representative, who was also asking for my routing number, and I hung up the phone. I immediately called Wells Fargo and spoke to a representative that started a claim for me and attempted to transfer me to the Fraud department, however the wait time was over an hour. Although I was willing to wait, the representative said he was embarrassed of the wait time and advised me to call the fraud department early the next morning with the phone number he provided. I spoke to the fraud department on XX/XX/XXXX and the representative deemed the transaction authorized since the XXXX transfer had been sent to a XXXX Bank account with my name on that account. I have no association with the XXXX bank account and do not have a XXXX account with XXXX bank. The representative also claimed that the transactions were authorized however, I did not initiate or authorize the {$3500.00} XXXX transactions to the fraudulent XXXX bank account. The agent stated that they would conduct an investigation which would conclude in 10 days. Wells Fargo sent me a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating that the XXXX transactions were authorized by me and were not fraudulent. Wells Fargo has closed the claim and has not returned the {$3500.00} stolen from my account. One of the letters I received from Wells Fargo also sited a transaction date of XX/XX/XXXX, which is incorrect. The letter from Wells Fargo also stated that the claim was transferred to the Claims Assistance Center and provided the departments phone number, XXXX. I called the provided number on XX/XX/XXXX, and the department had no record of my claim. The Claim Assistance department agent ultimately forwarded me to the Fraud department. I have made multiple attempts to resolve these unauthorized transactions with Wells Fargo, calling their fraud department on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. Each time, waiting for over 30 minutes to speak to a representative. To prevent further fraud, I closed and reopened a Wells Fargo checking and online account. I am disappointed with Wells Fargos customer service and lack of effort in preventing this type of fraud."

I used it and have been using for approximately 4 years now my credit card is ballooned with high interest. I also see as I told the Credit Union that I did not want insurance on the card because I am XXXX, but there was included in the monthly bill. I see also there are two interest rates totaling {$98.00} monthly charge. The convenience check was very deceiving because I thought there were no interest no where did I see an interest. This originated approximately 4 years ago and I was using these convenience checks one each month as it was sent to me on a monthly bases.

2127,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted via email "" XXXX '' by someone claiming to be "" XXXX XXXX XXXX HR Process Specialist at XXXX XXXX '' regarding "" Social Media Manager '' position at mentioned company. They had listed series of questions about my familiarity with the position, my previous experiences and behavioral questions and wanted me to respond and email them back. I did so on XX/XX/XXXX and they replied on XX/XX/XXXX stating they have decided to move forward with my application and extend an offer. They had also asked for my mailing address and phone number. I saw their email on XX/XX/XXXX and expressed my interest to proceed. 

Then, someone named "" XXXX XXXX '' from "" XXXX '' emailed me on XX/XX/XXXX, congratulated me and sent me the job offer attached to the email. I looked up this person on XXXX and confirmed he is a HR Manager at XXXX XXXX. The job offer covered the usuals in a job offer, went over pay rate for training and afterwards, etc. and had company logo and address and also watermarked with company name and logo. They wanted me to sign and return with a photo of my driver 's license. 

I signed and sent my DL the same day and then later that day XXXX XXXX emailed me and stated that they will send me a check for me to order the items they had listed ( computer and software packages ) from their vendors to set up my workstation. She/they emailed me again on XX/XX/XXXX and confirmed they are going to mail the check. They did so via XXXX Overnight ( origin address XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, MO XXXX ) that day and I received a check on XX/XX/XXXX morning in the amount of {$4900.00}. I confirmed to XXXX XXXX that check was received the same day and I was asked to deposit the check and send them the receipt. I deposited the check via XXXX mobile app and it became available immediately. I sent the receipt same day, then XXXX emailed me the next day on XX/XX/XXXX and asked me to be in contact with them via XXXX XXXX ( user : @ intpaper ) as that is their communication platform at the company. 

I created an account on Telegram and messaged the mentioned user and introduced myself. Someone named "" XXXX XXXX '' messaged me back and stated she is a Human Resource Manager at XXXX XXXX and was assigned to guide me on the next steps toward the training process. And, asked if I can start the training the next which I said yes. 

Then, she said she will inform the department and asked if I have any instant payment app, as the vendor needs to confirm payment before shipping the workstation equipments. I responded with XXXX and XXXX. She then asked me to deposit {$2000.00} via XXXX to user @ XXXX - XXXX XXXX with memo : TRN-EQ and to share receipt with her, which I did. Then she asked to send {$1100.00} via XXXX to XXXX XXXX - XXXX with memo : App-WS and share receipt. XXXX did not allow me to send more than {$500.00} and she said it is fine and we can transfer the rest tomorrow. Then, she got back to me and asked to cancel the XXXX XXXX and instead to try to send {$1100.00} via XXXX to XXXX XXXX - XXXX to see if with this user it goes through, again XXXX did not allow to send more than {$500.00} which I transferred and shared the receipt. She then asked me to be on standby for next steps. 

The next day on XX/XX/XXXX, I logged in to my bank account and realized the check was returned and my account has negative balance since the {$2500.00} was processed. 

I contacted XXXX immediately, they informed me that this has been a scam and the check account is cancelled/frozen and the only option is to dispute two transactions and contact XXXX as well. Since XXXX is through XXXX, it can be disputed only through XXXX. I filed two disputes with XXXX. Then, I contacted XXXX via email ( as phone call was not responded due to COVID ). XXXX replied to me later that day, stating that "" Based on the information you have provided, it sounds like the person you were transacting with did not fulfill their end of transaction and there is nothing we can do. We recommend to contact the person directly. If you are unable to, you may consider filing a report to local law enforcement. They can request for information we have on file. '' I filed a report to IC3.gov, local police ( my county Sheriff 's office ), Consumer Protection and Federal Trade Commission and as of today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) still waiting to hear back from them. 

Lastly, XXXX closed both my disputes as authorized transactions. I believe, XXXX did not do their due diligence in protecting me as a consumer of their banking services for over 7 years. I do understand how convenient the mobile deposit is, however, if the fund had not been made available, or if the verification process of the check account had not taken 2 days, I would have not transferred those amounts to the scammers. Further, it seems to me there is no consumer protection built in to XXXX process and its integration with banks such as XXXX. I contacted both companies in less than 24 hours from the time of transfers and neither offered me any protection whatsoever. 

I have been looking for a job for over 5 months now and had only {$2000.00} in savings. I am only hoping that all these reports will find a resolution for this matter and appreciate CFPB looking into this. I have maintained all records and can provide upon request."
2132,"On XX/XX/XXXX I transferred {$500.00} VIA XXXX through the Wells Fargo banking system. I sent the money to an experienced breeder of XXXX kittens who went by the name of XXXX XXXX. The total I owed XXXX was {$710.00} but XXXX has a {$500.00} transfer max within a 24 hour period. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent XXXX the balance of {$210.00}. XXXX had a professional website, was well spoken, answered all my questions, sent pictures/videos of the kitten I was inquiring on and even sent a contract for me to sign. When I asked XXXX how he takes payment, he told me he uses XXXX. I was very comfortable with this as it was through the US banking system which surely had to offer protection. This further solidified the unlikelihood that XXXX was a scam artist. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX asked for additional money to be sent and I quickly realized I had been scammed. I called Wells Fargo around XXXX am that morning to file a claim. 
I was given 2 claim numbers since I made 2 transfers. I was told it would take 10 business days for Wells Fargo to get back to me. I followed up twice in the interim to get an update but was told it was under investigation still. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called again to ask for an update because we were well passed 10 business days. I was on the phone with Wells Fargo for over an hour. I was getting passed around between the Online Fraud department, Customer Service and XXXX department. Each were telling me I was in the wrong department AND they were not able to pull up my claim. They said there was no claim that belonged to my claim/reference numbers. I asked for a manager and had to wait a considerable amount of time to be transferred to one, only to be hung up on. I was disconnected 3 times and transferred a minimum of 5 times. I was frustrated and gave up that night. I called back the morning of XX/XX/XXXX. Miraculously, I was in the right department AND my reference numbers worked. I was told my claim was declined on XX/XX/XXXX. 7 business days went by and I was not given an email, a letter or even a phone call. They told me Wells Fargo had no fault in the matter and that XXXX was a 3rd party that offers no protection. I have done further research on this, and it turns out scammers are taking advantage of XXXX. They know the general public believes it to be a safe way to transfer money since the consumer must sign on to their banking system in order to use it. The average person believes that they are protected. In order to utilize XXXX, you are required to have a bank account with a US bank AND in order to have a bank account, you need to physically go into a bank and show ID. So, if this is the case, then who is XXXX XXXX? I found many articles and blogs further backing this claim. What happened to me is happening to many others and all for the same reason. In fact, using XXXX is the sole reason people feel theyre NOT getting scammed. Venmos mission statement is as follow, an easier way to pay your friends and family, while XXXX, a 3rd party affiliated with the US banking system states We believe money should just flow. For Payments between friends, family and even strangers, XXXX wants to make money move easily. It states you can transfer money to strangers. It leads people to believe its safe, secure and protected. As a realtor, I must be vigilant with wire fraud. I have my clients sign Wire Fraud Addendums, I verbally tell them not to wire funds without confirming with myself as well as the attorney and I have it included in the footer of my emails. I go to great lengths to make sure I protect my clients from being defrauded. Wells Fargo has done nothing to inform their customers that this money transferring service is not protected. I shouldnt have to go digging for the info under the Q & A section of XXXX to find this out. This seems to be a common problem and Wells Fargo absolutely shares fault in this. They did not keep in contact with me throughout the process, gave me the run around and wasted my time on the night of XX/XX/XXXX, have not issued me a refund of my {$710.00} but worst of all, they have aligned themselves with a company that offers 0 protection and have done nothing to educate the customer that this is the case."

We then began negotiations on payments and arrangements moving forward. We agreed to use XXXX, a payment method through out banks. Not knowing much about it I trusted it since it was through my bank and if anything happened I could go to them to fix the problem. We agreed that I would send the first payment of {$550.00} in the beginning and the other {$550.00} once I had the wristbands. But throughout the day with threats of keeping my first payment and to not send the wristbands I eventually sent the rest of the money in two separate payments of {$350.00}, and another {$200.00} all through XXXX. Once the full amount was paid I stopped hearing from the seller and when I tried to call the cell phone had been disconnected. Know I had been scammed I contacted my bank to see if there was anything I could do or if I could even file a claim. After calling multiple times and talking to numerous employees they all said the same thing, since I willingly sent the money they can not do anything. Then they would go on to say to just alert the police and reiterate that there is nothing else they could do. I trusted the bank to have my back and they didnt."

On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX I made an ATM deposit and deposited a check in the amount of {$12000.00}. This check was from my business account at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The check was made payable to me and signed by me. During the ATM deposit I incorrectly stated that the amount was {$1200.00}.

Yesterday on XX/XX/XXXX I spent 75 minutes of my time on the phone with various Wells Fargo associates.

According to Regulation CC they are required to make the first {$5000.00} available. I am being told that my funds will become available on XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX.

2145,"On XX/XX/2018 around XXXX PM PST, I came across a XXXX post selling tickets for a music festival. All contact info was included, so I reached out to the sender with the offer to buy immediately as long as proof of purchase would be included. 

I told the sender to send me proof of confirmation of the tickets that would have been sent to their email. They sent me a screenshot of the email receipt. I asked for further confirmation and they sent me another screenshot, which included the transaction and festival name. Basically, it looked like it came straight from the site. 

I asked for a photo of their ID and other contact info and they gave me their email and a picture of a California driver 's license that matched the email and buyer 's name in the screenshot. I asked for one other example of proof and they offered their social media handles which also matched. 

I asked how they would prefer to be paid ( considering the festival was already happening ) and they asked to use XXXX through Wells Fargo. I've been a Wells Fargo customer my entire life and have had nothing but a good experience with them. That being said, I trusted the introduction of XXXX to their mobile app. I found the seller via email and confirmed ( yes, twice ) that I wanted this money to be sent. The seller reassured me they'd screenshot the confirmation of getting the transaction as proof it went through for me before sending me the tickets to my email. 

I sent the money ( {$250.00} USD ) and the seller immediately stopped responding. I sent plenty of texts, calls, voicemails and even requested the money back, but obviously, the user had been deleted. 

After I waited on hold for 45 minutes with Wells Fargo to report the issue, I was promptly told that it was out of their hands. XXXX isn't "" technically '' Wells Fargo, so they can't do any refunding or really any resolution whatsoever. Unfortunately, the only reasons I used XXXX is because I thought it was 1. A part of Wells Fargo in the first place and 2. Figured it would be just as trustworthy.

I called Wells Fargo immediately and I filed a fraud case, I had to wait being that this had to escalate to a department where an investigation was done. After 90+ days the investigation was completed and came back that the check was in fact stolen and someone deposited into their Wells Fargo account. Mind you 2 different names and this bank decided to honor this check under someone else 's name. After this I called every other day I spoke with so many agent for an entire year! None which knew what to even tell me, "" it seems like you are missing the affidavit. '' What a freaking joke i sent them 3 and over nighted them to Wells Fargo. This was on every XXXX call!!! we need another affidavit. 4 agents told me the refund was already on it's way, I spoke with so many Supervisors it's not even funny. Last they told me was that XXXX had to do a check reversal, I spoke with the Legal department in XXXX  they said "" NO, '' since they never paid out the check and they were not the maker of the check.

I immediately called Wells Fargo Bank NA. to report that I couldn't get into my online banking account and I had to call the 800 number to check my account. I made a claim to stop the Wire Transfer from happening and I was told that it would be investigated by the fraud department. It would take ten ( 10 ) business days. I received an email from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2021 saying my funds of {XXXX} was refunded back into my account. Checked my account and no funds for that amount was deposited into the account. An amount of {$XXXX} was put into the account and Wells Fargo said that's was all they could recoup and the claim was now closed Wells Fargo told me to wait for the investigation process and then sent email saying funds of {XXXX} were deposited back into my account and it wasn't. I need my full amount back into my account.
2149,My Name is XXXX XXXX. I recently had my house broken into they stole my wife purse along with my mobile phone and other things. The guy XXXX  himself {$500.00} twice I contacted the bank and they refuse to help me in addition Ive been hung up on by representatives.
2150,"XX/XX/2021 I was called by a "" fraudster banker '' from a Wells Fargo number ( Wells Fargo caller ID, verified number ) saying someone was trying to add themselves as a recipient to my account to wire transfer {$2300.00}, which would drain my account. I was asked for information like account number, PIN, birthdate, last 4 digits of SSN, etc., and I navely gave them the information, as I trusted that I speaking to a real banker. They were sending me verification codes to my phone number from official Wells Fargo SMS messages. They tell me they would have to initiate the transfer in order to open an investigation on the claim. 

XX/XX/2021 I call Wells Fargo to check on the status of the "" claim. '' Told by the representative that they have no claim number under the one I was given. We realize then that I was a victim of fraud. Rep now opens a claim, closes my bank account, and opens a new one. Tells me he would contact me with a resolution within 5 business days. 

XX/XX/2021 I call to check on claim status. I am told it was denied and closed the day before, XX/XX/XXXX. I was never called or notified. I ask rep if there is any way to reverse the decision, and she tells me it is possible. Says she would put in a request for the investigator, the original representative from XXXX, to call me back and run through the situation again, and that he should call within 2 business days. I ask if there is anything I could do to help my case. She tells me that in the claim 's notes, it was written that I did not file a police report, and that I should. I WAS NEVER ASKED IF I FILED A POLICE REPORT during that phone call, nor ever advised that I should from the original rep. I realized then that my claim may have already been mishandled by that original representative. 

XX/XX/2021 I call Wells Fargo again, since I never received a call. I am in the process of filing a police report at this point and ask for information about the transfer, such as the recipient 's real name, their bank name, locations, etc., as this is some of what the report asks for. This rep tells me they have no information regarding the transfer. I ask how they have no information, and she tells me their notes only provide details from calls. I realize then that the original rep came up with his resolution with no actual information regarding the transfer. This rep tells me she can put in a request for the investigator to call me back in 2 business days, yet again. I tell her I had already put in a request and was not called back, which was the reason I called that day. She tells me the "" notes '' say I was called on XXXX, and I supposedly hung up. I received zero calls before or after I called on XXXX. No calls show up in my phone history, and no voicemail, email, any type of notification was left whatsoever. The rep from XXXX also never mentioned me having been called, so I feel this statement was falsified. Regardless, I still never received a call between my XXXX and XXXX calls. This representative proceeds to put in another request for a call-back. I ask her if I should be receiving the call from the same fraud department number, or if it would be from a different Wells Fargo number. She responds that it would be from the fraud department. 

XX/XX/2021 I get a call from a representative, who was not the original investigator, from a random number from North Carolina. At this point already, I see that Wells Fargo representatives do not even have cohesive answers to my questions, since I was told the day before that I would be called from the fraud department, and I was not. This phone call was just to give me some information about the transfer, like I had asked the day before. I realize then that I was only called because they now had a note that said I was filing a police report, not because I wanted to run through the situation of my claim again. I ask this rep if again, there are any chances I could still get my money back. She tells me Wells Fargo gets XXXX attempts to reverse the transfer, and they have only tried once so far. The original representative denied and closed my case after ONE ATTEMPT. If I had not told these reps that I was filing a police report, this information would not have been relayed to me, and I truly believe the last two attempts would not be made. The representative tells me to just "" keep a look out '' to see if the money would appear back in my account; did not say I would be notified of any changes or anything. These Wells Fargo representatives do the least for their customers and leave them in the dust when they need help most. 
I received a letter later that day, denying my claim as I was told stating, "" As the money will not be returned from the receiving bank, we are not able to reimburse you. '' This "" investigator '' denied and closed my claim with the reasoning of "" the money will not be returned from the receiving bank '' after having only tried ONCE out of their three attempts to reverse the transfer. This letter was dated XX/XX/XXXX, but was not sent until XXXX, and I did not receive it until the XXXX ( picture attached. ) There is absolutely no sense of urgency by these bankers about something so time-sensitive and as crucial as this situation. I followed the policy instructions of notifying the bank of situations like this, and they still did the very bare-minimum. There is a complete lack of communication from them with their customers, unless they are made aware that an official report, like my police report, is being filed. 
I have turned in my police report at this point ( XX/XX/XXXX ), and have made a security freeze to my credit file as well, which I also had to find out about on my own, when I wish I had been informed about by the very company I trusted to handle my money. I have no income and have had almost no money for nearly three weeks because I have been getting the run-around by these bankers, and they have completely failed me by not fully attempting to help me get my money back. And there still leaves the question of how this "" fraudster banker '' was able to identify that I was a Wells Fargo customer and retrieved my name and contact information, called from a Wells Fargo number, and sent SMS messages from Wells Fargo, if not for a security breech in the Wells Fargo system."
2153,"I initiated a bank to bank transfer from XXXX to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. The money was debited on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, it still did not reflect. I called Wells Fargo and they told me that I can cancel. I cancelled and then called to XXXX to ask about timeline for returned funds. XXXX representative on XX/XX/XXXX told me that he sees that it was cancelled and it will take 1-5 business days to be returned. 

Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I called XXXX and they said they don't have any funds. Wells Fargo said they don't have any funds. {$6000.00} is missing from my account ( stolen practically ) and I was told to file some paperwork to dispute it by fax or mail. 

This is basically fraud committed by banks to steal someone's hard earned money."
2156,I sent money to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX who I met on XXXX through wire transfers through wells fargo it spanned from XXXX to XXXX it was over XXXX dollars it was 12 different times the money was deposited into a wells fargo account and nothing was red flagged it to all of my savings and I have 3 different loans now for five years I need help. The bank has the information but won't help.
2157,"I filed Complaint ID XXXX on XX/XX/2021 against Wells Fargo Bank XXXX I received a response from CFPB on XX/XX/2021 advising that my complaint had been closed because Wells Fargo Bank has responded. Wells Fargo 's response was that they could not help me and there was nothing more they could do. This is unacceptable and I want a further investigation into the crime that Wells Fargo has committed. On XXXX  XX/XX/2021 I wired {$81000.00} to a Wells Fargo account number. I had included a beneficiary and memo. The beneficiary on the account DID NOT match the beneficiary on my wire transfer. On XXXX  XX/XX/2021, I confirmed with Wells Fargo that my money was received and was placed on hold. I was advised on that call that I would be getting the money back. I was advised that because my money was put on hold that it would be transferred back to my bank, XXXX XXXX. I still have not had my money returned and Wells Fargo has provided me with this information : The account that I sent money to was flagged for fraudulent behavior and their relationship with the customer was terminated. Wells Fargo used the {$81000.00} that I wired into this account to indemnify another customer that was scammed by this account. Wells Fargo committed a crime of conversion by taking the {$81000.00} that could be traced back to me to send to another customer. I would like CFPB to look further into this before just closing the complaint."
2161,XX/XX/XXXX I thought I was being contacted by Wells Fargo about a money transfer fraud. They had me sign up for money transfer told me I had to make a transfer to stop the transfer. Thats were it went wrong as soon as I figured out what I had done I left work went to my nearest branch and told them to stop everything. Well I just received a letter stating that they will not return the XXXX dollars and I am out because I authorized the transfer.
2162,My phone was stolen on the evening of the XX/XX/2021 and they loged into my wells Fargo Bank AP and did five transfer using XXXX totaling XXXX Dollar 's and they won't refund my money I have a police report that I sent to them along with a receipt for the new phone I had to buy still nothing was done
2164,"I'm a Wells Fargo customer and another Wells Fargo customer ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) sent me {$500.00} through XXXX on Sunday, XX/XX/2021 and gave me the confirmation number given to him upon completing the transfer ( XXXX ). Mr. XXXX is XXXX years old and not familiar with XXXX but he sent it because I needed the money on Sunday and the banks would be closed until Tuesday. Mr. XXXX sent it to my phone number ( XXXX ) but I did not receive the money in my account nor did I receive a notification. After I still had not received a notification regarding the transfer, Mr. XXXX went to a Wells Fargo branch on Wednesday, XX/XX/2021 to inform them of the situation. After verifying that the money had been withdrawn from his account and not deposited into mine, the bank officer gave Mr. XXXX a phone number ( XXXX ) for me to call and inform them of the discrepancy. I called the number on Wednesday, XX/XX/2021 and spoke with a supervisor who said she would file a claim and gave me the case identification number ( XXXX ). I called the online banking number again on Thursday, XX/XX/2021 and spoke with a representative and gave her the claim ID number that I had been given the day before. She said that no claim had been filed so I asked to be transferred to a supervisor and was transferred to XXXX with the customer service advocacy department. He filed a complaint for me against the supervisor who failed to file a claim but lied about doing so. He also filed a claim for the missing transfer. He told me it could be something as simple as a transposed number or that Mr. XXXX was not a registered sender with XXXX. I asked Mr. XXXX if someone could please call MrXXXX XXXX and walk him through the steps to register as a XXXX sender. He took Mr. XXXX ' phone number and told me he would pass the info along and that someone would be assigned to my case in one to two days and that they would call me back either on Thursday or Friday. After not hearing from anyone on Thursday or by XXXX on Friday, I called the online banking number again. I was told it would take one to ten days for my case to be assigned to someone and another ten days for the issue to be resolved. I needed the money urgently which is why Mr. XXXX sent it to me on Sunday through XXXX which is immediately available but by Friday, the money had not been transferred and someone had not been assigned to my case. I've been unable to work and needed the money to pay my electric bill and buy food. When the money failed to transfer, I was forced to pawn my TV in order to have a little money. I can't wait 14 days for this issue to be resolved and everytime I speak to someone, all they can say is it's going to take ten days for my case to be assigned. I think this is unacceptable considering XXXX stated two issues that could have affected the transfer, both of which could be resolved with one phone call and certainly wouldn't take ten days to accomplish. I have spoken to approximately 8 different people in customer service but got no satisfactory customer service, all I received was the run around. They aren't concerned with the fact that they withdrew {$500.00} from someone's account and can't account for it 5 days later. Nor are they concerned that someone who has been unemployed for weeks and dependent upon this transfer doesn't have the luxury of waiting 14 days for her money. I wish life worked that way but it doesn't."
2167,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I made an online money transfer on wells fargo webiste, and the money {$5000.00} was from another bank linked. On XX/XX/XXXX, I got email next day saying it is a fraud. Then I called the fraud department, and verified everything and asked them to process the transfer. BUT, later I found out the transfer was canceled. I NEVER asked them to cancel it. BUT, wells fargo took the {$5000.00} from another bank even though they say it was canceled. Today is XX/XX/XXXX, the money is missing. Wells fargo took the money illegally and never return the money to my another bank, nor explain how they can help to deal with it. I am calling the fraud department now ; they say they can not help. The whole bank is a fraud and a joke. I need the money back and compensation. My time and moeny is wasted. Case Number : XXXX"

I asked for the money back and they blocked me and declined my request. Same scam used in XXXX. Contacted the police, FBI, XXXX, and my bank."
2169,"On XX/XX/2021 around XXXX.. I checked my Wells Fargo online banking account and noticed a charge for XXXX from XXXX  and immediately called the fraud center to report that my card had been compromised. At XXXX that evening, I received a call back during my work hours from the same number I had called at XXXX and thought for sure it was my bank calling about my dispute.. come to find out it was a scam and the scammers got my information because they acted like they were helping me and with Wells Fargo.. They wire transferred {$14000.00} from my account through XXXX XXXX in California. My entire savings, {$2000.00} from my credit card, and all of my checking account completely wiped.

I am without a doubt screwed if I can't get that money back. I will be XXXX, with a XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. Please help me."
2170,"Wells Fargo has denied this and I need your help PLEASE! 

Wells Fargo Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, SD XXXX On XX/XX/21, I was contacted via my computer with a SCAM. I immediately replied to XXXX that I did NOT even know what XXXX was, nor did I know who this person was. Within minutes, I received another email that {$3400.00} had been taken from my XXXX account. 

We immediately went down to our local branch in XXXX XXXX XXXX branch and spoke to XXXX. She closed our account and initiated a request for a new account. While on hold with the Fraud Department, her phone was cut off at noon ( since bank closed for XXXX XXXX at noon? ). 

We went home and I immediately contacted the Fraud Department myself. I advised them that the transaction for {$3400.00} was a SCAM I have NO IDEA who the person was who was initiating a XXXX transaction for this amount. I also had NO IDEA what XXXX even was until the Bank representative told me. Apparently this is something that someone has to initiate with their account # or something and we did not do this. 

There was another XXXX request the next day simply stating that someone wanted initiate something but no amount ever went through on this. It was a different person 's name but both were XXXX requests. They may even be 'working together ' on this SCAM.

Whoever this is needs to be reported. We have requested that NO XXXX TRANSACTIONS be processed on our account and the local branch has assured me that this is done now. 

Please reinstate this {$3400.00} credit to the account. It is a totally false transaction and it is not fair that I have to have this case closed because XXXX states they can do nothing further. Another bank would have investigated this further and found out exactly who these individuals are."
2172,"I was sent through my University of XXXX XXXX email about a "" XXXX SURVEY APPLICATION JOB '' on XX/XX/2021. I emailed back under the impression that it was a job through my university. The instructions were to receive a check ( {$1800.00} ), purchase XXXX XXXX related supplies, send the remaining and keep {$220.00} compensation, send back remaining funds, then carry out survey. I received a check via mail via XXXX  and cashed it to my bank. It was not until the check bounced after I sent back the remaining funds that I realized I was scammed. 
I was emailed by XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Check was from The Fund for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CT XXXX XXXX XXXX {$220.00} was kept in my account.

Remaining amount of {$530.00} was sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX via XXXX. 

I called Wells Fargo to report the fraud. They reported it, however, I was to still pay the funds back and they would not take any further action without a police report. 

I called three XXXX stations and each one of them rang until it went to voicemail or call ended."
2173,I used my checking account with Wells Fargo to make two transactions ( {$300.00} per transaction ) via XXXX on XX/XX/2018. I was buying golf tickets on XXXX and seller wanted for me to transfer money through XXXX. Tickets were fake and Wells Fargo has refused to do anything about this.
2174,"Well 's Fargo won't pay out the IRA from my parent 's estate to us because I am unable get medallion signature from anyone -- even them. I have spent hours and hours trying to get this and I am unable to. Not even from Well 's Fargo. So I guess they plan to keep my money- even though it's a relatively small amount. I am a busy professional, I have lost work time in my attempt to get that medallion signature. I even called their Estate Care Center and they couldn't help me!!!!"

The story / rationale they gave me for requesting XXXX was that they were able to hold their prices down by not accepting credit card transactions and paying credit card fees. 

They confirmed receipt of the XXXX transfer / payment, said they would send shipping info within minutes, and then, they disappeared. 

Never received my merchandise, and I can not seem to successfully file a claim through XXXX- The XXXX site keeps asking for a 12-character, alpha-numeric Payment ID, and Wells Fargo hasn't heard of such a thing."
2176,"I was a victim of a XXXX scam in which I sent {$280.00} to the seller through Wells Fargo, using XXXX. Immediately after the transfer was completed I contacted them to cancel the payment because I realized I had been scammed. Wells Fargo explained that because I had authorized the transaction and it had been completed they could not do anything, but suggested I contact local authorities. After learning the only authorities that would hear my case were the FBI, I investigated what my other options were. I found out that you could find out what bank the money was sent to by contacting your bank, and that upon learning which bank the scammer had an account at you could launch an investigation on that account. So, I contact Wells Fargo to get information regarding which bank the scammer had an account at. The scammers account was also at Wells Fargo. At which point I asked if I could launch an investigation or what the next steps were, only to be told that because I authorized the payment it did n't count at fraud, which is true it was n't fraud on my account, but the owner of the other account committed fraud, according to California Penal Code 484 ( a ). But Wells Fargo continued to tell me that it was unlikely I would get my money back, and that this account is valid. Wells Fargo is allowing criminals to use their accounts to conduct criminal activity, as is XXXX as there have been numerous account of scams that occurred through XXXX, and large forums of scammers collaborating on how to use XXXX for scamming."
2180,"On XX/XX/2021 I made contact with someone on XXXX who was selling a XXXX. 
On XX/XX/2021 I made a XXXX dollar XXXX transaction. 
On XX/XX/2021 I filed a claim through wells Fargo to hopefully get my money back because I was fraudulently scammed. 
On XX/XX/2021 I was told they can't get my money back."
2181,"On XX/XX/2022 I was attempting to call an XXXX customer service number about a package that was stolen. I called the number that popped up when I googled XXXX customer service number. They stated they were XXXX customer service and walked me through a process I thought was to get a refund. They had me send several XXXX payments to what I was told was a server that would trigger a repayment. I realized this was obviously a scam and hung up the phone. They sent several fake texts saying the money I paid for my package had been returned, as well as calling me multiple times to say I needed to finish the process. I immediately called Wells Fargo to let them know what happened and to cancel all XXXX transactions. The banker I spoke with canceled my debit card and sent a new one, assuring me that the XXXX payments would not go through because they were still pending and those payments would be canceled and returned to my bank account. The next morning, the payments had not been canceled, they had been sent and confirmed, I called Wells Fargo back and they informed me I had received incorrect information, and the banker should have filed claims for me to fight the transactions. The claims for each XXXX payment were then filed, totaling {$2400.00}. I waited 10 days and then reached back out to Wells Fargo to check the status. I was told the bank reached out to the bank that received the money and asked for a refund and they refused so the claim had been denied and there was nothing else they could do. The bank informed me that those payments from me were "" authorized '' and therefore Wells Fargo was not going to refund me, even though I was not aware that I was sending money. 

Wells Fargo is holding me liable for unauthorized transactions, after telling me the transactions would be canceled."
2182,"A prospective client found me on my website. He asked for my professional services. I quoted my price and he sent a check that I deposited in my Wells Fargo Checking Account. The amount appeared in the Pending Transactions Window for three days. The fourth day, a Monday, it was in the CREDIT COLUMN. I believed the check had cleared. Fraudulent client asked for money back on Tuesday. Tuesday morning the amount was still in the Credit Column. I sent him {$4000.00} out of the {$5800.00} he had sent as I had already started the work.I had a cashier 's check prepared at 1 PM on Tuesday at a Wells Fargo branch and deposited the money at the bank indicated by the fraudulent client. On Tuesday night Wells Fargo informed me the check had not cleared although it had been in the Credit Column since Monday. I sent the money back believing the check was solvent. By the time Wells Fargo informed me that this was not a check supported by funds it was too late. My question is - WHY WAS THE AMOUNT IN THE CREDIT COLUMN OF MY CHECKING ACCOUNT AND NOT LEFT IN THE PENDING TRANSACTIONS WHERE IT HAD BEEN FOR THREE DAYS? Wells Fargo fined me {$12.00} and takes absolutely no responsibility."
2187,"I first received a call from "" XXXX '' on Tuesday XX/XX/2021 at XXXX and XXXX. The number on my phone read Wells FargoXXXX. XXXX told me that someone had hacked my checking account and in order to reverse the charges I needed to follow his directions. He stated his employee ID was XXXX. He then instructed me to first send XXXX via XXXX and then XXXX via a wire transfer to XXXX XXXX XXXX account. XXXX then called me the next day XX/XX/2021 at XXXX saying that he had good news which was they had caught the guy that had taken my money his name was XXXX XXXX and that he was in jail but that he had taken more money out over my savings account-a total of {$22000.00}. He then instructed me to log on to my Wells Fargo account to keep my money safe. I followed his directions and wire transferred two separate payments XXXX and XXXX. XXXX followed up calling the next few days. When I missed his call on XX/XX/2021, I called Wells Fargo and they informed me that he didn't work there. I then followed steps to report a claim with Wells Fargo for the various transfers but no one at Wells is helping and they told me they cant get any of the money back. I have tried calling multiple times and have had difficulty with anyone responding. Given this fraud, I am hoping to use Regulation E of Electronic Transfers Act to get my money back."
2188,"On XX/XX/2019 I had an international wire transfer coming to me and Wells Fargo was the intermediary bank. They said the funds came through but were given to someone else whose name did not even come close to matching mine but somehow had the same account number? Wells Fargo said this rarely happens but it can happen. They told me there was nothing they could do as the money was gone and spent. They even said they knew who took the money but could not get it back because it was already spent by the person who stole my funds due to Wells Fargos mistake. This wire was for {$8000.00} to help pay for my mothers XXXX  expenses. How can they think its okay to give funds to the wrong person without any recourse?

We called several times to speak with Wells Fargo on the missing funds and their answer was always the same. Yes, we received the wire, gave it to the wrong person, and there is nothing we can do. It got to the point where they starting hanging up on me as soon as I gave them the account information to see what can be done."

2197,"On XX/XX/XXXX an unauthorized access occurred to my online Wells Fargo bank account in order to add a phone number to my account. My email was being spam bombed to hide the email that was sent out stating a change was made. 

On XX/XX/XXXX a fraudulent wire recipient was set up and a fraudulent wire was done for {$4500.00} around XXXX XXXX  EST. Again my email was being bombarded with spam to hide this activity. However, this time I saw the email notifications shortly after this fraudulent activity occurred and called Wells Fargo. It took me 40 Mins to get in touch with someone who could freeze my account and was unable to get my funds back. 

I filed a claim with the bank as I did not authorize this activity. After speaking with a claim handler who verbally told me on the phone it was a clear cut case of fraud and they were going to recommend I be reimbursed, a manager reversed that decision and denied my claim. I escalated to the Manger of that department who reviewed my claim and Wells Fargo is claiming my "" device id '' was the one that performed this activity so they can not reimburse me. 

The device they said performed these actions was my work laptop. I opened a ticket with my work IT who performed a scrub of my pc and said there was no malware and they also could provide logs showing my pc was not turned on when the unauthorized phone number was added on XXXX and I was not accessing the Wells Fargo proxy server on XX/XX/XXXX when the wire activity occurred. I informed Wells Fargo of this and I was told by the claim handlers manager that because their logs show my "" device id '' They won't reimburse. They also refused to share their logs with me so I could have my IT department refute their "" evidence ''. 

I can't even defend myself and the proof I have this activity was not performed by me does not matter to Wells Fargo. I've closed both my savings and checking accounts with Wells Fargo and had them open new accounts to avoid further exposure. I've filed a police report. I've notified the credit bureaud to flag my account as a victim of fraud. I've changed all my online credentials. I've done everything I can and have clear evidence I am a victim but I am being treated as a criminal by Wells Fargo. 

This is the most horrific customer service experience I've ever had. All I want is to be reimbursed for something I had no involvement in."
2199,"I had a closing scheduled for a property she and her son were purchasing in South Carolina for on or aboutXX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX, 2021. Unfortunately, the law firm that was handling the closing for me and my son, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ), had a security breach shortly before this date. As a result, I began to get emails instructing me where to send purchase money for the closing from a scammer using an email account that was very convincingly impersonating the email account of the paralegal we had been working with at XXXX. Following the instructions in these fraudulent emails, I ended up authorizing a wire in the amount of {$24000.00} to the account number indicated therein on XX/XX/ 2021. The following day, as soon as I found out these emails had been faked and we had just wired the money to the wrong account number, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and requested that a wire recall be sent. 

I also immediately reported this incident to the FBI, the FBIs XXXX XXXX, and the XXXX Police Department, and continued to communicate with the managers of both bank branches involved in the fraudulent transaction : XXXX XXXX, manager at Wells Fargo Bank, and XXXX XXXX, manager at XXXX XXXX. I provided all the documentation of the reports I had made to the police and to the FBI to both managers, as well as a copy of the actual email conversation that took place between us and the persons perpetrating the fraud through the impersonated email account. I was given assurance from both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( both from XXXX XXXX  ), that the scammers bank account had been frozen, the money was still present in the account, and that we would be getting our money back. we expressed our gratitude and asked that they please contact me if they needed any additional information to help them in concluding their investigation. 
Subsequently, on or about XX/XX/2021, I had another phone conversation with XXXX XXXX, who again told me that I would be getting my money back either that same day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) or the following day ( XX/XX/XXXX ). He stated that they had been able to flag and freeze the scammers account because the account beneficiarys name was different from the actual name on the account. Me and my family were so relieved and grateful. I sent an email to XXXX XXXX following our conversation to confirm what was discussed ( also attached ). However, several days passed and I did not receive the money back as promised. 

I reached out multiple times to inquire about the status of the investigation and reversal of the wire. I spoke to XXXX XXXX again, but she informed me she could not reach the Wells Fargo investigator and implied that she was not able to do anything further. I did not believe MsXXXX XXXX was doing everything that was within her power to do. Therefore, I decided that I would try to make contact the Wells Fargo Fraud Investigation Department ( Fraud Department ) directly. I was finally able to reach the Wells Fargo Fraud Department, but when I did, I was shocked when they informed me they had not yet received any of the supporting documentation for this fraud claim investigation. I had submitted this documentation to Ms. XXXX at least ten ( 10 ) days earlier. The Fraud Department told me they would try to contact Ms. XXXX themselves to request she forward them all of the information. I spoke to the Fraud Department again shortly thereafter. They reported they had reached out to Ms. XXXX and requested she send them the documentation, but she had still not provided the same. 
I spoke to Mr. XXXX and Ms. XXXX XXXX again on XXXX XXXX, 2021. Now, in sharp contrast to their previous communications which promised me the account was frozen and I would be getting my money back, they now advised me, I have to go back to Wells Fargo for further help. I did not know what to think at this point, but I was understandably not happy with the back and forth both XXXX and Wells Fargo have engaged in with me at this point. I'm especially upset with MsXXXX XXXX apparent lack of initiative and failure to pass on important documentation that I had provided to her, which was intended to enable Wells Fargo to take whatever actions they could to stop my {$24000.00} from being lost. If the money is truly gone at this point, and Wells Fargo and/or its Fraud Department could have prevented this from happening if MsXXXX XXXX had promptly passed on the documentation I provided, to the investigator, It seems like both banks are treating me like a pendulum and not helping me. It seems like clear negligence of Wells Fargo employees and here is why I strongly believe that : 1. Wire transfer was done on XX/XX/XXXX. I requested a swift recall on XXXX but Wells Fargo failed to issue a recall until XX/XX/XXXX. 

2. The bank never asked for any documentation from me to send it to their fraud investigation team. 

3. I proactively sent an email to the branch manager Ms. XXXX XXXX few days later to forward my police report/FBI report/hackers emails and all the relevant information. 

4. 20 days later I heard from Wells Fargo Employee XXXX XXXX that Wells Fargo investigator never received the papers and he will email her to request these papers. 

5. Next day she reached out to me saying she never got them and I have to send it to her again which I did. 

6. 2 Days later when I reached the wire department, I was told they still do not have them. 

7. If the Wells Fargo investigator doesnt have my papers, they can not offer the papers to XXXX investigator. 

Obviously Wells Fargo dropped the ball in my case causing me to short {$24000.00} based on their negligence and poor work ethics. 
On the other hand XXXX and its management constantly assured me that I will get my money back and now are telling me to contact my bank as they can not talk to me."

2201,"On XXXX XXXX I was trying to buy concert tix on XXXX. The seller said he did n't have a XXXX account, which I always use because it is SECURED. He offered to use XXXX. I immediately went on my bank 's website, WELLS FARGO, and read their notes about their partnership with XXXX. It said clearly that they SECURED XXXX transactions! I felt comfortable and processed the {$500.00} payment. After not receiving my tix in 15 minutes, I was on the phone with Wells Fargo to report fraud. They said, "" It was great that I called right away and they would handle this for me. '' Well, after a few months of "" investigating, '' they will not reimburse my money and I now see that the "" We secure these transactions '' verbiage from their site is no longer there. Please help!"

And an XXXX buyer named XXXX said he would buy my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$950.00}. 
The buyer had no choice but to purchase through XXXX because his XXXX ID was hacked, and asked him to pay {$950.00} with his XXXX account. 
The buyer said he paid, but this was a phishing e-mail. 
XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) I didn't know I was fooled and sent the product directly to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. In XXXX, battery handling is strict, so I applied to XXXX through a delivery agency. So, the location is XXXX. This was a big mistake. The tracking number is XXXX. Here 's the link. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX And on XX/XX/XXXX, the signature of the unknown XXXX was confirmed in XXXX. At the time of delivery on XX/XX/XXXX, the seller offered a condition that the XXXX account limit would be lifted only when {$1000.00} was refunded, and the scammer lied that he would deduct {$2000.00} in credit. At first, a scammer asked for remittance in XXXX, but I said no, and I was forced to ask for my account number and try to transfer it, and I remitted {$1000.00} to a remittance company called XXXX XXXX at around XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Related pdf was extracted from the text. Yesterday in XXXX time, they said they paid {$1000.00} falsely to the XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) address, and as a result of checking, XXXX is still pending and only requested sent. Unfortunately, as a result of checking at XXXX XXXX. on XX/XX/XXXX, it was an obvious fraud and XXXX said it couldn't be helped. 
The scammers took my money and the things I was trying to sell. 
I need help."

We contacted XXXX  XXXX via Cfpb complaint and they responded saying "" After review, we confirmed that your employer will need to work with their bank to resolve this matter. XXXX XXXX will need to receive a Without Entry Affidavit from the issuing bank to return the funds. '' Our employee banks with Wells Fargo and they have been unwilling to provide us the appropriate documentation that XXXX XXXX is asked for so that we can be paid our wages. 

All I'm asking is that Wells Fargo complete the Affidavit and send to XXXX XXXX so we can be done with this."
2207,"I received a text from a Wells Fargo number on XXXX, asking if I had initiated a XXXX transfer to XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$3500.00}. I replied NO, and then received a call from a Wells Fargo number ( XXXX ) on the same day. The person went through all of the typical "" prove who you are '' information, by sending a text to my phone. Then they said I needed to "" receive '' the XXXX payment back to myself. So, they had me transfer via XXXX {$1000.00} & {$1000.00} to myself @ XXXX. The following day ( XXXX ), I received another call from Wells Fargo stating that the investigative team had shown that my on-line account profile had been breached. They stated that I needed to move money to the new on-line account that they were setting up for me. So they had me wire transfer {$24000.00} to the "" new '' savings account to my email address : XXXX to get my new on-line profile started. All seemed as if it was correct. On my way home from work, I thought I would stop by my local Wells Fargo bank in XXXX to see what further needed to be done to secure my new account. At that point, they told me it was fraud. I contacted the Wells Fargo Fraud Department later that same day ( XXXX ) to report the incident. 
Wells Fargo gave me a "" provisional '' credit for the 2 - {$1000.00} XXXX transfers ; however, they said they could not do anything about the $ XXXX. I did find out that the $ XXXX wire transfer went to another Wells Fargo bank. Wells Fargo said they had to get permission from the receiver of the funds to return it & they could not contact them. 
I have filed a police report with my local XXXX Police Department - case # XXXX."
2209,"On XX/XX/2021 I received a call that had the number as XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX at around XXXX XXXX. Before answering the call I searched up the number to make sure I wasn't answering any spam calls. I do this since sometimes my doctor or my schools financial aid would be calling me from a different number and I might not have that phone number theyre calling me from saved on my phone. The same phone number called me twice, but I did not answer as I was searching up the number. After searching up the number, I found that it was the Wells Fargo customer service number so I answered the second time they called. I did not find anything suspicious. The call with the scammer lasted about 8 minutes ( see picture attached ). I thought that there was probably something wrong with my account that needed to be fixed. Once I answered, the first thing I heard was the voice verification that Wells Fargo has. Everything was so similar to the actual Wells Fargo customer service. Then a man told me that my account was used at a XXXX in XXXX, Georgia for about {$450.00}. I always get a notification on my phone whenever I make a purchase. However, I did not receive any notification about this purchase. I got so panicked and scared because my card was used without my knowledge for such a large amount of money. 

I logged into my computer to see if I could see the purchase he was talking about in my checking account. I only saw a XXXX transfer pending for {$850.00} to XXXX XXXX. Since I couldnt find anything from my bank account, I went to my email since I also get notifications about my purchases there. I then saw that I added a new XXXX recipient named XXXX XXXX ( See image attached -- XXXX email ). I do not know any XXXX XXXX. In the email, it says that the number XXXX will be used to notify this recipient of any money or requests I send them. This number is the number registered on XXXX as XXXX XXXX, who added themselves as one of my recipients without me knowing. I was at my house studying for a test when I got the call, which is also why I did not see the email about XXXX XXXX adding themselves. Before I could even process what was going on the man on the phone said that he would send me a code that would stop both the XXXX and XXXX transaction from going through. Since I was already panicked and scared, I just gave it to him without knowing that I was getting scammed. Then after giving the code, he still remained very professional and said that he would reset my XXXX account and send me a new card then the phone call ended. Nothing raised any suspicion here. 

My friend then texted me after the phone call ended since I texted her while I was still talking to the scammer and she said are you sure its Wells Fargo? and that was when it hit me and read the message with the code again and realized that it also says Wells Fargo will never call or text. A few minutes later I called Wells Fargo customer service ( ( XXXX ) XXXX ) and the woman who answered said that they never called me and tried to check my account so I was put on hold. I hung up since Ive been on the phone with her for 11 minutes and still hasnt sent me to the fraud department. I called the Wells Fargo fraud services at XXXX a few seconds later at around XXXX XXXX  and I got to speak to the fraud department ( see picture attached ), I spoke to him for about 37 minutes. I practically got scolded by the fraud department representative that I spoke to saying if you wouldve read the message then you would not be down {$850.00} right now. That was my mistake, but instead of making someone feel even more stupid, I couldve gotten him to help me right away. After working on getting a new checking account, he told me that I would most likely get my money back based on the information I gave him. He told me that he opened up a claim/case and that it would take up to 10 days to get a decision based on their findings. After hanging up the phone and searching up about filing a claim, the representative did not give me a claim number. Now realizing that he shouldve given me a case number, I am not sure how my case is going to be handled properly as he missed a key information that I needed to refer back to. 

How can a big financial company such as Wells Fargo have better security where their phone number can not be copied by a scammer and call their customer? I live in California and have not left California in over 4 years, my area code is XXXX. The area code of the number added as my recipient ( XXXX ) is from XXXX. I do not know anyone in XXXX, I have never been to XXXX, and have never even thought about going to XXXX. All of my relatives and friends are in California. I am a full time college student, who doesnt get to travel at all especially during the pandemic."

2217,"I am customer with Wells Fargo since XX/XX/XXXX. I was trying to buy tickets to XXXX XXXX  online, and seller had good reason to selling at 20 % discount. We agreed to 50 % before and 50 % after I receive my tickets. I was buying 8 tickets and discount was significant I transfer {$220.00}. Phone number of seller was XXXX and money was sent using XXXX at XXXX and was sent on XX/XX/XXXX, this account is with XXXX ( US ) per Wells fargo Agent. My bank today informed me, there is no protection as I sent the money. When I had called on XX/XX/XXXX after seller stopped responding to txt ( he/she ) was at work so couldnt talk, I sensed scam. I called wells fargo and asked to hold this money. It was showing pending and agent said, they have taken notes and will try to hold. Next day I was supposed to receive call back from Wells Fargo - didnt get call. I called, and found money was sent as this was XXXX   transfer. The app for wells fargo, doesnt have option to make standard ( 3 day ) transfer, that online bank website has, so money went instantaneous. Wells fargo agent said, they are working with counterpart at XXXX to revert, but today agent says they can not do that, as I made transfer. Why not put a hold and ask each to prove why money was sent or why received, especially when complained? What protection does online money transfer provide? Or bank to bank relation ship between wells fargo and chase. They are helping fraudster 's with this, they allow them to open account ( i think even that was using wrong id ) and supporting by not holding this amount and others. The phone number is inactive since XX/XX/XXXX (  later in day ). So are the banks telling scamming is much profitable business than earning 8-5? That while they open accounts in your name, they can not protect your money, especially when a customer calls SCAM on this transfer?"

Responded no and went to call the bank and the bank called me in the process. Ended my call answered the other line and spoke with some stating they where a representative from Wells Fargo. Even spoke with someone stating they where a supervisor. I was advised to create a XXXX account with my information and send money in checking acct to myself. The money never returned to me. I was advised by the bank it was a scam and a hacker spoofed my phone number and took the funds and because it was through XXXX the transaction had no covered protection from Wells Fargo or XXXX.

2220,"I filed a fraud claim on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I had forgotten and left my phone at a restaurant. Once I realized the phone was missing, I returned to the restaurant. Spoke with the manager, who advised no cell phone had been turned in that day. Therefor, my phone was stolen at the restaurant. I called the police, who said they would file a report, but without any suspect information, it could not be further investigated. Eventually, I was able to use my iPad at home and use the Find my iPhone feature to locate my phones location. So I showed up at the home where my phone was located and was able to get my phone back. The problem was, I had no passcodes on my phone and no FaceID enabled for personal reasons. This gave the thief access to all my stored passwords and the ability to add their biometric data like FaceID, which they used to get into my bank account and send a {$500.00} unauthorized XXXX transaction. When I discovered the unauthorized transaction, I filed the claim. I was told my claim is not covered under the Zero Liability Policy as Wells Fargo concluded this transaction was authorized. That is NOT the case. On XXXX, I sent a fax with an explanation of what happened in further detail along with my police report from XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo sent a letter back to me stating they are continuing to deny my claim. I called their claims center as I wanted reasoning to why my claim was still denied. The Wells Fargo representative, XXXX, advised there was nothing that could be done and hung up on me when I requested a manager. I called back and spoke with a manager, XXXX, who stated the claim is still denied due to biometric data being used to log into my Wells Fargo app. This was explained in my original claim and in my fax : the thief added their biometric data into my phone. The manager then proceeded to victim blame me and say I was at fault for not having passcodes on my phone and that there was nothing he could do to get my money back. I have submitted a full explanation of the incident that explains every reason they gave me to deny my claim, as well as a police report from the incident. This is more than enough documentation to approve my claim and yet Wells Fargo refuses."

The transaction posted on my account the very next day. However, the receiving party never received it. I was told to wait for 5 business days for it to go through. I waited till XX/XX/XXXX. It was still not received. I went into the local branch to start a wire claim. I spoke to XXXX XXXX ( a personal banker ). He initiated the claim and provided a claim number. I was told to wait 10 business days. He said we would be contacted either by phone or by e-mail. To this day, no communication has taken place from Wells Fargo, except for when we called in. 

I waited till the 11th day and called to check on the wire investigation. I kept getting a run around between online fraud and online non-fraud departments. Nobody was able to tell me anything about the investigation or where my money was. Finally, I went into the local branch again to speak to XXXX XXXX. He also had to call customer service and they kept transferring him between agents, without a straight answer. By this time, I have waited more than half a month for my money to be returned or found, as it was never received by the recipient. He said he escalated the matter to the resolution team. I was told to wait 3 additional business days. It has been 3 business days and I have yet to hear back from anyone. It would be exactly one month tomorrow since I had first initiated a wire transfer. I have not heard from anyone or received a refund.

They are refusing to hear my complaint and challenge their decision and poor investigation I feel that this is criminal to steal money from a customer when Im depositing cash at an ATM that doesnt print receipts like it should.

I received a job interview through the app from XXXX XXXX which is based in XXXX, XXXX. The company set up the interview through XXXX where we communicated since XX/XX/XXXX. The company offered me the job as XXXX XXXX and my salary would be {$22.00} an hour during training and {$34.00} following the weeks after training.

After completing the forms, I continued to do the assigned task for training where the company stated I will be paid for during my first week of payment. The hiring manager that I was communicating with, went by the name of XXXX XXXX. The company sent me a check on XX/XX/XXXX for the equipment and it was put on hold by Wells Fargo and I contacted them after a few days and it was returned because of the signature on the back. XXXX then asked me to use XXXX, XXXX  XXXX, or XXXX XXXX to send me the money but I did not go through with it. The company sent a check via email a few days later after consistently asking what was the hold up on receiving the information and after I kept attempting to set up a XXXX  or video chat call. The company stalled and stated their schedule contained 8 meetings back to back and they will fit me in. After receiving the check, I was instructed to deposit the check through my bank. I proceeded with the training task and they asked me to pay for the activation portal which was {$300.00} while I wait for the funding to be approved by their financial departments and I will be reimbursed through my first check. I only had {$200.00} for the activation and sent the money to the company via XXXX XXXX  and bitcoin. The company then sent two more task with payments attached to them and stated I will be sent the money with the first check. I was not able to acquire the {$100.00} so the company sent me a check in the mail for my equipment and activation and tasks payments on Friday, XX/XX/2021 for {$4800.00}. They told me to deposit the check immediately into my account to help the process go faster to order my equipment and synchronization for the applications ( XXXX and XXXX ) and the activation portal. The also asked for my username and passwords for the apps and emails. They deleted some of the emails they sent and locked me out of the apps. I contacted the applications and they have closed the account for one of them. The email is completely reset but I retrieved all of the emails and information. When arriving to the bank to deposit the check on Saturday, XX/XX/2021. I spoke with the teller inside the bank of Wells Fargo and asked her to look over the check to make sure it was not fraudulent or suspicious. The banker stated the check was good to go and and that it will be deposited into my account. The check was deposited and {$400.00} was available immediately and the rest was available the next morning. The company asked for proof of check and deposit and I sent them pictures of the receipts and they told me I needed to send the funding to 3 people ( XXXX XXXX ( Wells Fargo Checking Account ( Bank Name : Wells Fargo ), XXXX XXXX ( Wells Fargo XXXX Account ), and a bitcoin wallet for my equipment, synchronization, and activation. After sending the money through my bank, I got suspicious because it did not seem right although I have never had a remote position before. Although the check went through, I decided to contact the bank where the check came from ( XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) on Tuesday, XX/XX/2021. I spoke with XXXX from the bank and he was not aware of the company that gave me the job and they investigated the check information I provided. They stated the check as a bad check and it was returned to them. The company on the check was XXXX XXXX XXXX and they did not know anything about XXXX XXXX.

The email provided is XXXX. I did not deposit this check and went into Wells Fargo and it is a fraudulent check.

I have been a long time customer, yet they were unwilling to help me in any way to recover my loss money.

2238,"I received this text message : Wells Fargo Bank : Did You Attempt {$3500.00} At XXXX XXXX XXXX reply NO reply YES reply HELP for help or STOP to stop. Msg & data rates may apply. 

I replied, no. 

Within a few seconds the phone rang. It was an automated voice asking if I was available to take a call from Wells Fargo and to press 1 if I was available. 

Like I told me his name was XXXX XXXX from Wells Fargo and he was going to help me get my money back. 

He said we're going to XXXX and you're gon na send it to yourself. 

At one point I told him I wasn't sure that he wasn't a scammer and he told me look at the phone number I'm calling you from, it's the same as on your credit card. 

My mind is a bit fuzzy on what happened next but basically he had me going to XXXX to send the money back to myself and next thing I know a thousand dollars was out of my account and he hung up. Everything pointed to Wells Fargo. Up until that moment that is who I thought I was talking to and I was lured into sending money because I thought I was going to lose money and then it happened anyway. There have been many times on my email accounts where someone is trying to access them and I will get a notification and I've even had it happen with Wells Fargo when somebody was trying to fraudulently use my debit card. 

I immediately called Wells Fargo fraud department. I filed a claim and had to wait 10 business days for a reply just to be told that it wasn't fraud it was a scam and that I now needed to file a money movement claim. 

In the meantime, I had to change my username and password and they made me close my banking account even though I had not given any information about the account to the scammer. They were supposed to allow my rent check to go through and they did not and it bounced and I was charged {$100.00} in NSF and late fees. I notice came along with a notice to vacate if fees were not paid within the next week. I was not told that they refused payment on the check. As of today, I have not even received anything in the mail stating that they refused to pay my rent check. There was money in the other account to cover it just like all the other Auto pays for the next 90 days. 

Then on XX/XX/XXXX I got a letter stating that they were sorry about the theft of my checks. Which is not what happened. And on XX/XX/XXXX they denied my claim. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I filed the money movement claim and XX/XX/22 today I was told because I made the transfer they had no responsibility. 

I have spent more than four hours on hold trying to resolve this matter. I've had people give me the wrong information. They would transfer me to the wrong people. They put me on hold only to hang up on me. I even had someone at their executive office hang up on me. One Wells Fargo branch worker tried to tell me today that their phones were sketchy. The man had my information up on the screen all he had to do was call me back and he did not. 

No one could be bothered to give me a phone call or even to explain to me on the phone why the case was closed or what the disposition was. When I try to get the girl to get someone from claims on the phone, they didn't even want to talk to me. One woman even gave me the phone number for XXXX. 

I have reference numbers for Wells Fargo and for XXXX.

2240,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I conducted a transaction using Wells Fargo that used XXXX to pay for XXXX XXXX tickets with an individual I met on XXXX. We discussed over the phone and text messages that the terms for 4 XXXX XXXX tickets at XXXX stadium would be for {$2200.00}. He requested I use XXXX since it 's bank to bank and the electronic transfer of tickets would be made immediately. The individual mentioned that he was unable to receive the transfer, so he wanted to meet in person. After several attempts to try to meet, the individual said they cancelled the transaction, to give it a couple of days to refund, and gave the tickets to someone else. I knew immediately something was fishy so I immediately filed an online fraud claim with Wells Fargo. On XX/XX/XXXX, I followed up with Wells Fargo online fraud. Since I used XXXX, Wells Fargo claims no consumer protection and would not provide me with any information of the individual 's bank or real name after saying that the service is only for friends and family, not strangers. Absurd since that information should be readily available if they 're known to me! They said this would require a subpoena via legal avenues, so I filed a police report with the text messages with the scammer. I just received the copy of the police report today on XX/XX/XXXX Shocked that Wells Fargo and XXXX would allow this!"
2243,My name is XXXX XXXX and I have an account with Wells Fargo I was using anther company to make wire transfer because it was less expensive This time they asked me to call Wells Fargo to get Advance Access code and when I did they told me that I should receive it by mail during 3 business day I told the agent that I couldnt way for three days so she told me to go to the office bank and do the wire transfer through Wells Fargo I asked to speak with supervisor named XXXX and after explaining the issue it just simply hang out
2245,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was emailed through the school system of Oregon XXXX that a remote job opportunity was available paying {$350.00} a week, as an assistant to a professor. I responded showing my interest. On XX/XX/XXXX They said the next step to acquiring the job was to make a list of supplies that I would need as an assistant. A laptop, a printer, a stack of papers, and a self-inking date stamp. They sent me a Bank XXXX XXXX check for the total amount of the supplies plus first weeks pay. {$1000.00}. I thought I had a job. The check was being processed, but I had {$400.00} immediately available. I was asked by the professor to send {$680.00} through XXXX to a sales representative for them to purchase the printer and self-inking stamp. I thought that if anything were to happen and the job didn't work out I would only lose around {$280.00}. I tried to send the transfer. Wells Fargo properly flagged it down. I received a call from customer support for Wells Fargo at XXXX PM on XX/XX/XXXX. The person on the other line asked if I knew the person I was sending the money to. I replied no. The person on the other end got impatient, "" Well did you authorize the transaction? '' This is where I think they made a big mistake. The operator just wanted me to say enough to cover Wells Fargo in the case of fraud. It was not their intended purpose of keeping people 's money secure by asking more questions and making sure this was not a scam or fraud attempt. After the funds were sent I was more hesitant to send more money. The check was said to clear on the XXXX the XXXX funds didn't send until the XXXX. On the XXXX, I realized I was scammed and took screenshots of all the conversations. On the XXXX, the day after the funds were sent, I called Wells Fargo to file a fraud/scam claim. They took down this information and said they filed a claim. It is XX/XX/XXXX and I have received no communication from them. I have since changed my passwords, username, and turned off digital wallets, but there should have been more done by Wells Fargo. Especially considering how close the date of the claim was to the sending of the money. 

Attached is screenshots I took on XX/XX/XXXX of all the messages both over email and text. There are also two screenshots of the calls between myself and Wells Fargo."
2247,"XX/XX/XXXX The following is a timeline of what transpired from XX/XX/XXXX- present : I, XXXX XXXX was told in XX/XX/XXXX he was losing his job of almost 18 years with XXXX XXXX XXXX . XX/XX/XXXX was his last day. He was applying for jobs everywhere on different career job sites from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, he was contact about a job with a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as a XXXX/XXXX XXXX. They said they found his resume on the career job boards. He was interviewed over the phone by someone XXXX XXXX who was his "" supervisor '' for the entire month. Email : XXXX Phone : XXXX. XXXX is the toll free company number he is given. He was told XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is based out of XXXX with their main headquarters in New York : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, NY. They said they had an office in Florida and they were expanding into Michigan and Texas and that he would be the first in Michigan. If he was found to be trustworthy and do a good job he would be the lead in Michigan. On XX/XX/XXXX, he signed an employment letter that they sent him accepting the position. The employment letter details compensation, commission and benefits. He is told he will be paid commission on everything he buys and ships so there is an incentive to buy and ship as much as possible. On XX/XX/XXXX he was given his first assignment to buy products from XXXX XXXX. He left my children 's spring concert in order to do it as soon as possible so they would be happy with his performance. He made an error and put it on our personal credit card. The next day he returned and re-purchased it with a XXXX card he opened for this purpose to keep it separate for expenses etc. He was told he would put it on his card for 3 weeks ( probation ) while he proved himself to be trustworthy and then he would be given a corporate credit card to put the purchases on. He was given a Wells Fargo account number to link to the XXXX account to pay for the purchases : Account # XXXX. Routing # XXXX. ( this is the complaint- I tried to call Wells Fargo as well and they said could not be helped since it is not my account and No one from Wells Fargo was looking into this Fraud Account ... ) Once the money was in his account and he paid the XXXX balance and the balance said {$0.00} he would ship the products. Because the money would come in within hours and the XXXX balance would clear to {$0.00}, he thought everything was legitimate. He speaks with or emails XXXX pretty much every day in XXXX. He continues buying and shipping using the same process above. From XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX there was 0 indication that there was a problem. During the course of the month he shipped approximately $ 50K of XXXX XXXX Products are shipped to : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX FL XXXX Approximately $ 8K in products from XXXX XXXX are shipped to addresses in XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

She send the same account number on XX/XX/XXXX. He responds and tells her that and there is no response. On XX/XX/XXXX, he goes into a local XXXX bank to find out what is going on with the accounts. They try to use the XXXX XXXX account and tell him that it is invalid/closed. He tries contacting the company again that day and for the first time in almost a month they do not answer or return the calls. On XX/XX/XXXX he files a police report and a report with the FBI. On XX/XX/XXXX he goes into a local FBI agent XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX. He also files a fraud alert with the credit agencies and XXXX XXXX. We send an email to a VP of XXXX XXXX ( fraud dept ) to share what happened. I have not heard back from him so I am not certain if he will be the contact for this. We have not heard from anyone at XXXX yet : XXXX Since last week and this week more money is being reversed. The grand total is $ XXXX between products and shipping. We have contacted XXXX XXXX corporate and local to try and stop this from happening again. He called Florida and was told he could not file a police report because we are in Michigan.

2249,"Dear Sir : I was so happy to read the article in XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX is right to make Wells Fargo a poster child for bad practices. This bank has a long and sordid history of engaging in unethical behavior from hiring and promoting staff to illegal offers to clients. 
Trust is central to proper functioning of the banking system. On that point I have to state that I have been denied trust from the bank due to several bank allowances in which there is not rationale. 
Problem : The Wells Fargo Bank allows for non- customers to deposit funds into checking accounts at their ATM machines. This allows for fraud. I was a victim of a banking allowable fraud. 
Wells Fargo bank gives customers the opportunity to use a digital wallet account and a contact list etc., etc., that they can create an online account and access a number and pin number to deposit funds without the use of identification. I have contacted several banks where this is not available to do. It is available through Wells Fargo that a customer creates to withdraw funds not deposit funds. Its very tricky to create and is a loophole for criminals to collect money through scams. 
Wells Fargo customers can now deposit cash from any of the bank 's ATM machines around the country without a physical card. ... To use the new feature, customers simply log on to their app to request an access code. At the ATM machines, they can use that code and their regular ATM pin to complete a transaction. XX/XX/XXXX How this banking error has affected me is that the Wells Fargo banking error allowed for my family to be targeted and scammed. My family members are hardworking and victims of measures that should not be available for criminal to take advantage of. Im retired and substitute teaching, my husband is deceased. My mom is XXXX XXXX XXXX and a XXXX XXXX as well. My son, XXXX is an XXXX in New York. He lives and works in New York and is an XXXX with the XXXX XXXX XXXX. He works hard and is trying to earn moneys to live a decent life and attempting to pay for his student loans. We are needing this healing as we are suffering from the loss of this money. The injustice occurred on XX/XX/XXXX when my mom received a call from my son, her grandson, XXXX. The person told her he was XXXX and was in jail and needed cash sent to his lawyer to get him released. My mom, XXXX is XXXX XXXX XXXX was given a number to call to get information on how to get him released from jail. She called the number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and they told her to deposit {$2500.00} into an ATM account. They told her that he was in jail in LA, after being in an auto accident transported to ER and was released to jail. She phoned me and explained the situation. I was told that the person was legal aid employee for Attorney XXXX XXXX. He wanted me to call him once I had the money and go to the Wells Fargo ATM location at XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX and make the deposit there. When I got to the bank to enter the XXXX bank representative said I could not come in if I didnt have an appointment. She directed me to go outside to the attached ATM machine. So I had to go to the attached ATM machine outside the bank. I called the attorney back and he gave me the access code to deposit the money in the particular ATM machine designated. He didnt allow me to write it down nor the pin number as I was nervous and under pressure I deposited the cash. There is a button to press to go the access your account only using a pin number. I did receive a receipt which is attached decided to bring it into the bank after I couldnt get an answer as to when my son was to be released. I finally got the bank attendant to let me in where I explained the situation and showed them the receipt. Bank Officer XXXX and Mr. XXXX XXXX said there was nothing they could do right now but report it to the officials, they took my receipt and gave me a copy and said they had to have the original as it would be turn in as evidence. That I should hear back in two days. I filed a police report and a copy of the receipt which is attached. 
I waited two days and called the bank officers back where I was sent to several transfers and finally I was told it would take ten days to get back with me with a resolution. I was given the claim # XXXX ( XXXX contact number ( XXXX ) XXXX. Later given ( XXXX ) XXXX as the department handling my case. I waited again for ten days and finally was assigned a claims adjuster name XXXX. She was extremely rude and short with me when I explained my situation. At first she said there was nothing she could do then she said she was going to close the case. I then decided it must be an inside job or why would she be so rude to me after only talking to her for all of 30 minutes. She had no compassion or remorse. No follow up just hung up the phone in my face. You can investigate my story through the claim number, receipt and police report attached. I do know that ATM machines store the data in it and can be investigated. Why didnt the bank officers immediately have the machine closed and investigation proceeded immediately? I feel that not only could the bank have stopped the transfer but can prevent this illegal actions as described for the future. Please consider our serious lost and refund the money. Please feel free to contact me at the address above, my email is XXXX, and my phone number is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I appreciate your listening to my concerns in this letter and the support you will give to our family. 
Resolution : Yes, it has taken me a while to gather the strength to compose this letter but I have hope in your integrity and the power of XXXX XXXX to restore our funds that were raised and borrowed. Wed like to get our hard earned taxed {$2500.00} back and also like for the banking system to be fixed so no one else can fall victim of this crime. Id also like an apology from XXXX in ATM customer claims. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX"
2250,I went to the local bank in turlock to talk about a possible scam on my account. They sent me a. Letter saying that I had made that payment myself so they accepted the XXXX transfer to a different account.. I have been on hold multiple times by the bank and nothing ever gets resolved. I got scammed and he gained control of the online payments. And reversed them. So now I'm backed up in my payments after paying him in crypto and helping him get back. I realized he was lying about the whole thing and gained my confidence and friendship through out months. He was supposed to come back to the US in XX/XX/XXXX but is now demanding more money saying he dint Meet the agreement he had with the lawyers out there in that country. He sent me a picture of the demands. He was very demanding and was definitely a professional scammer. He made a bunch of transactions I was not aware of.
2251,"On XX/XX/22, I had gone back to work after having been sick with XXXX  for XXXX weeks prior. At the time, I was still dealing with symptoms relative to "" XXXX XXXX  '' or "" XXXX XXXX '' and are symptoms I'm still currently experiencing to this day ( XX/XX/22 ). Needless to say, I wasn't feeling at all like myself at the time. That day, ( XX/XX/22 ) I received an automated call that asked me to verify my name by pressing "" 1 '' if it wasn't me, and "" 2 '' if it was. I pressed "" 2 '' and the call transferred me to a man claiming to be a Wells Fargo representative who was calling to address fraudulent activity on my account. A lot of the details are listed in my report to the Federal Trade Commission. I will link a copy of that, and I will do my best to explain it a second time here. This individual claimed that there was fraudulent activity on my account and that someone by the name of XXXX was attempting to make a wire transfer on my account for {$19000.00}. At about this same time, I received a text message from a number I did not recognize stating, "" Wells Fargo Bank Fraud Alert - Did You Attempt A Transfer For The Amount Of {$19000.00}? Reply YES or No or 1 to STOP Fraud ''. The phone number I received the text from was ( XXXX ) XXXX. The man over the phone mentioned this text and asked if I saw it. I said yes, I did, and he asked if I was the one attempting to make this wire transfer, I said no. He said that the attempt needed to be disputed, and that after following his steps the amount will be returned after 24-hours, my cards and accounts would be cancelled, and I would receive new cards in the mail within 1-2 business days. I thought this was a little weird, because I did not have {$19000.00} between my accounts, nor had I ever. This initial wire transfer failed. I mentioned this and the man stated that the individual was attempting to make another wire transfer of {$11000.00}, and I received another text stating the same thing. He asked me again if this was me, and I said no. He said that the new attempt for {$11000.00} had to be disputed as well. This time he had me transfer the money from my checking account to my savings account stating that this had to be done so the checking account could be closed since it was compromised along with the savings account. ( In my FTC report I stated the amount transferred from my savings to my checking was {$7700.00}, but this is incorrect, and I did not realize this until after I submitted it. The amount was transferred from my checking to my savings in that amount ). He was able to verify the amounts in my checking and savings accounts before this occurred, and all the while this conversation was happening, he was verifying other pieces of information to me such as my name and address. This meant he had visible access to my account and information. During this time, I was feeling weird about the call, so I pulled out my bank card and the number that the man was calling from was the same customer service number as on the back of my bank card ( XXXX ). I also asked for his name and employee ID. He gave me a fake name of XXXX XXXX and a fake employee ID. After this transfer between my accounts occurred, the second wire transfer attempt for the {$11000.00} was unfortunately successful. After this I had mentioned my credit cards and asked if he would cancel those as well, and he said he was able to do that. At this time, he said I should be receiving a text. I did receive this text. It was from the same number that I would normally receive statement alerts for my credit card. The text stated that someone was attempting to make a purchase with my credit card for a large amount at XXXX XXXX. I argued that I wasn't trying to make a purchase and that I was trying to cancel my card, and if he was needing a verifiable amount, to make the amount less. I received another text stating someone was trying to make a purchase at XXXX XXXX for another, slightly smaller, large amount. At around this time I called my credit card company to see if they were seeing this transaction. They said that they did, but that it hadn't gone through yet. I asked the man impersonating the representative to hold while I talk to them, but while I had him on hold, he hung up, and I immediately knew that I was in a bad situation. 

All of this is to say, that at the exact moment that he hung up, I cancelled my credit cards, and immediately called Wells Fargo back. I had to wait on hold for a considerable amount of time ( about 30 minutes ) before I could get in touch with a Wells Fargo representative. Due to the sensitive nature of the situation, when I had spoken to someone, it took me a little bit to explain everything. Once I had, the Wells Fargo customer service representative said he filed a claim, and I asked him to let me speak to a supervisor or someone in fraud to ensure that it was going to be handled urgently. He then said he would transfer me to the fraud department. I again had to wait for another considerable amount of time before someone answered ( about 45 minutes ), to which I then had to frantically explain the situation again. After my explanation, that representative said I had to actually be transferred to another department in order to have a recall case filed. She transferred me, and I had to wait for about another 30 minutes. I explained the situation yet again in as much detail as I could. The lady I spoke with began to file the case after I had given her all the information, but we had been disconnected. So, I immediately called the number back and spoke with someone else, to which I explained the situation yet again. All the while there didn't seem to be a huge sense of urgency, but I understand that they were just trying to do their jobs. During this time, a few hours had passed before I was able to finalize filing the case from the time the fraud had happened. They had said it could be up to 10 days before I received a response, and they gave me a number to check up on the status if I needed to. As I said before, this was an urgent situation, and they couldn't seem to provide me clarification as to whether this was going to be handled in a timely manner. This was under my understanding that due to the gravity of the situation, 10 days was more than enough time for it to get to a point where there was nothing that could be done, whereas if they handled it immediately, there may have been a chance. This was extremely important that I try to do everything in my power to get this back, not only because it was an extremely large sum of money, but because it was everything that I had been saving since I started making money in high school up until that point. The money was going to be used for school and to be able to afford a place to live when my lease at the time inevitably ended. Over the course of me waiting, I called on many different occasions to check up on the status of the case and they were able to provide me with little to no information except that it was being processed. I also went and filed a police report during this time as well. On the XXXX day of waiting, I still did not receive a call back, so I called again to check on the status to which they again did not tell me much. I was at work during this time, and I received a call not long after the end of my initial call, from the individual who was looking at my recall case, and she called to clarify some information stating there was still no response. She called back again shortly after we hung up and said that she actually did have a response. At this point however, I had to wait almost two weeks to be told that there was nothing they could do, and I was out all of my money. I was devastated. For clarification as to why I'm reporting this so late is because I was told that there was nothing that could be done on several different occasions, and I had to find out through other parties that I could even file these reports. I had to figure out someway to be able to support myself for the time being and near future. Fast forward to now, and I've managed to find the time and words to complete these statements, but it doesn't change the fact that this has been a huge effect on me, and will probably continue to be, although I'm trying my absolute best to recover."
2252,"Starting on XX/XX/XXXX all the way through XX/XX/XXXX there was a series of XXXX unauthorized transactions on XXXX XXXX through my Wells Fargo bank account and debit card. If my math is correct I was robbed of almost XXXX XXXX dollars in total. {$7800.00} to be exact. All of the transactions made were NOT authorized by myself and I never received any notifications of these transactions. In other words they were unauthorized transactions and/or fraud. I contacted Wells Fargo and their claims department and was told that they would do everything to help me and make the situation better. A few days pass and they advise me that they denied my claim and will not reimburse me for the amount we had agreed upon and said would be reimbursed after investigation was completed. I just had a son ( he is literally not even XXXX month old ) and I was in the process of putting a down payment for a house and/or buying a dually truck for my hotshot business Im in the process of starting. On top of this issue I had another XXXX issues with my account. These involve XXXX and XXXX. Its clear that the people that gained access to my account were simply trying to drain my bank account and were well versed in their scam and manner of taking money from their victims. The XXXX transactions started XX/XX/XXXX and lasted up until XX/XX/XXXX. There was a total of XXXX transactions totaling {$2500.00} with all XXXX added up together. Then to finish this all off, there was another set of unauthorized transactions made through XXXX. These started on XX/XX/XXXX and went through XX/XX/XXXX. There was a total of XXXX transactions and they add up to {$3100.00}. All in all the total adds up to {$13000.00} all together and its absolutely ridiculous that this is even possible."
2256,"XX/XX/2020, {$1400.00} XX/XX/2020, {$1400.00} XX/XX/2020, {$1400.00} and XX/XX/2020, {$1400.00} I Transfered the stated amount in four different occasions via XXXX. when I discovered its a fraud, I called my bank to retrieve my money from the recipients but they told me that because the money has posted that they can not retrieve it and that I should call the recipients to send the money back to me which I did but the recipients refused and did not want to answer my calls till date."
2257,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent money to someone through XXXX for an alleged XXXX XXXX XXXX. A day later I messaged the seller to ask when it'll arrive to be blocked and scammed. I've already messaged my bank, Wells Fargo, and XXXX to be told I can't / won't be helped."
2259,"Back on XX/XX/2021 an acquaintance of mine on XXXX started posting stories pertaining to a cryptocurrency company that she has recently joined. Further on her posts she was claiming how this company ; Basecoinmining.com, provided her great wealth in just a matter of hours. She was highly advertising it to her followers on instagram how easy it is for them, including me, to be on the same financial path like hers. She was stating that if were interested in joining the platform shes marketing she is tagging a friend- the broker, in her story and we can just directly send her a private message with our inquiry. I'm XXXX years old with a family here in America and in the XXXX that I'm fully supporting. Investing has always been on the back of my mind, it's a matter of how to start it and who to approach prior, so when her story was presented to me i took it as an opportunity to grab. On that same day I sent her friend- the broker, a message of interest. Her XXXX page is named XXXX with a username of @ XXXX. After a while she responded back and thats when we started to exchange messages. She was telling me that she has people from different age groups and financial statuses that shes mentoring about cryptocurrency mining and how they are earning up to {$3000.00} - {$5000.00} daily. She then was asking me first how much Im willing to start to invest and if I'm truly certain in joining she asked me to purchase bitcoin worth my investment via cash app and send her a screenshot to get started. I did purchase Bitcoin from a cash app worth {$1000.00} on XX/XX/2021 using my Wells Fargo debit card that was linked in my cash app wallet and after I completed the transaction I sent her a screenshot of it as a proof that I bought it. The broker, XXXX, told me to send it to the platform address of their crypto mining company which is XXXX and If needed I have their wallet address. Prior to that we had some small problems because I was having issues purchasing bitcoins from cash app with a large amount of money. She then recommended a few websites to buy bitcoin from- she was sending me links for moonpay.com and simplex.com, but still nothing was working. I was having the same issues - error on purchasing bitcoins. Afterwards I asked her if I could send it through XXXX or XXXX instead, in which she agreed to do all the transactions through XXXX. I used two bank accounts, my Wells Fargo and XXXX Federal account for most of the transactions, but there were two transactions where I bought bitcoin from a Bitcoin ATM ; this was one of her suggestions with regards to purchasing bitcoins as well. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent her money through zelle with an amount of {$3500.00}. She instructed me to have this email XXXX as the recipient. She was stating that this fee is to upgrade my trading account so i can have a bigger profit limit and subsequently an email was sent to me stating that I need to make another payment for conversion rate code because it being required to be issued to verify that there is a legal transaction between me and basecoinmining trading company, they further stated that this is mandatory for withdrawals via crypto wallet deposits for investors within the united states, as within regulations on trade being monitored by the XXXX and XXXX. I adhered to all their requests and I sent the amount of money that they were asking. I was entrusting them my money, I was asking for reassurance of business and she was telling me all the promises and how my trading account is blooming thanks to their work. She was telling me that I can watch and check how my money is working for me through their website. It was a perfect scheme, I was under the complete impression that everything was legit. It wasnt until later on when it dawned on me. But I further went on trading with them, i am receiving emails from the company on what are the next steps for me and my trading account, on the emails they kept asking me for fees that I need to pay such as, transfer license so I can make withdrawals from my trading account to cash app account, payment for conversion rate codes, as well as payment to them for TAX charges for IRS, and payment for high traffic charge due to high price of bitcoins. After a while with all the payments I was being asked for, my suspicions started to surface. I was messaging them back on how and when I can withdraw my profits, but all the response I received was soon, when I made this additional payment. On XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX I sent the broker another transaction through zelle using my XXXX XXXX bank with the amount of {$2200.00} and I was instructed to send it to the same recipient XXXX. She was stating that this is another payment that I need to make so I can withdraw my money from their website. The two other transactions were through a Bitcoin ATM and I paid that with cash. I got both of the receipts with the wallet address of the fake broker that told me to send the bitcoin to. The first transaction was {$2500.00} on XX/XX/2021 and the second one was on XX/XX/2021 with the amount of {$1500.00}. On XX/XX/2021 still with no definite answer on when can i receive my funds I found out that that friend of mine from XXXX who initially posted the story referring us to the fake broker have her account hacked, I have on my phone the information and proof that her account got hacked by someone else that might be link to the person who is behind the fake brokers account as well. I tried to confront the fake broker but I did not get the response that I needed. I sent them a couple more messages prior to the matter but they stopped responding to me. I already filed a report of fraud to my banks and I also submitted a report to the Federal Trade Commision. I am with high hopes that I'm able to retrieve all of my money, if not just even a percentage of it. I was blinded with the thought of having fast money. But all 's too good to be true, I invested all my savings and basically every XXXX that I have. I am greatly seeking help on my case. I am an honest citizen of the United States, I am actively serving this country. I work in the military in which we arent highly compensated with money. I hold so many plans for my money which are mostly to help my family, but all of which seems to be impossible. I am struggling so badly and am having a hard time seeing the light in the tunnel that Im in, despite it all I'm still hoping to get through this matter. I am desperately asking for help that someone will get back with me prior and assist me in furthering my case. I am willing to cooperate if any more information is required. Thank you and God bless!"
2261,"I sent a {$3500.00} wire transfer from my retirement account and it was sent to Wells Fargo, to an account that was closed years ago. The wire was rejected but Wells Fargo decided to keep {$50.00} for the incomplete wire. 

Banks charge fees for insufficient ACH transactions, bounced checks and similar things, but they are charging THEIR client in every case. Many banks also charge THEIR clients for incoming wires. These fees are part of the bank 's "" Terms and Conditions '' to which their customers agree when signing up. 

I am perplexed that Wells Fargo can reduce an incoming wire by a non-customer, and I do n't see how that 's legal as there is no wire or account agreement that says they can. The entire amount of {$3500.00} should have been returned. 

I can not think of any situation where anyone or any company, absent a court judgment, is permitted to take money from someone else without their agreement and Wells Fargo should return my {$50.00}."

I have a buyer who buys homes that's pre-foreclosed and he wanted listings of expired withdrawn taking off the market home so he can contact the owner to buy the property. 

So I sent him an address of one of the properties that he could check out. 

He contacted me that the information that I provided to him didn't exist. 

So I deducted that this huthomes.com is a scammer. 

So I contacted my bank and filed a complaint to have my money return to me and told the banker that I didn't want any future charges come out because they'll cancel my debit card and it issued me a new debit card. 

This morning Thursday XX/XX/2022, I checked my text messages and Wells Fargo had deducted {$49.00} for HUD XXXX and then they put a block on my card so I couldn't use it until I verified debits. 

I called my Wells Fargo banker and he tells me he's going to ask me clothes and questions about purchases and please answer yes or no. 

He asked me about a XXXX XXXX charger {$7.00} I said yes he asked me about her homes XXXX charge and I told him you just lied to me cuz you told me you going to ask me a close-in question but this is an open-end question and I'll tell you why? 

Because initially I did authorize this debit but when I find out the company was a scammer I filed a complaint you guys gave me a credit and you didn't you know you didn't put a block for future charges so that's your fault not mine. 

But I don't know how to answer your questions because in the past yes I authorized it but today I did not you guys authorized it against my wishes because you knew I blocked them a month ago and now you're taking the money out and asking me if I'm authorizing it and I can't answer that with a yes or no because if I do you're going to say my you know it's a fraudulent charge you going to cancel my debit card and send me another one and I'm in the process of notifying my debtors with this new card I got. 

I started with the local banker they explained to me it's a gray area because there's authorized and there's unauthorized migrate area where it was authorized and changed the later not authorized doesn't fit that category but what I should do is when I challenge one of those those charges they gave me a credit I should tell the banker and make sure for future references you don't take any money out when I get another cad.

It's not my job to do the bankers job they should offer me that information when I authorize something they give me a provisional credit they should ask me sir do you want to block all future payments and I will tell them yes if that happens then I wouldn't be having two conversation with my bankers today and contacting your agency.

Because the first banker told me sir when you when you file that complaint and we give you a provisional credit you could tell us to block all future payments.

She give me the manager and they tell me sir when it's when you stop a payment we have no procedures to put a block on future stop page.

So I asked the manager which one of y'all is lying the lady that told me that y'all could block future or you when you said you can't?

So my bank is talking out both sides of their mouth so I'll need to make a complaint so when I tell the bank that I authorized something and I don't want to authorize in the future that they have that in my account that that's going to automatically block future deductions from my account in case the card number changes.

I told a banker I don't care about other customers but for me that's what I want in my account and he told me he couldn't do that.

So I'm notifying you guys to file a former complaint against my bank and then to make them put that in my account so if I authorize something change my mind and don't authorize it they automatically change their procedures for me so they asked me do you want to block future charges and I'll tell them yes so I don't spend an hour and a half trying to undo something that my bank did against my authorization which they knew about before they did it."
2263,"I came to the Wells Fargo establishment in XXXX. Store location XXXX. The service manager XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX refuses to give me my money. 

I arrived to the bank the first time to withdraw {$3500.00} and she XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX said I needed my drivers license I used to open my account ; even though I had my ID with the same address on it. Ive also withdrawn money using my ID previously. 

I went home and came back stood in the long line with the appropriate credentials ; I was called by a gentleman teller who just started his shift because I was in the long line outside when he walked into the bank. 

He told him my request and he was assisting me. I filled out my deposit slip and passed it to him and as He was typing : She XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX said something to him then told me : that since I didnt fill out some papers that the bank sent me in the mail ( that Ive never gotten ; nor seen ) she didnt even show me, nor offer to get the form for me to see. That I couldnt take out any money from the bank. Bank policy. 

I asked Whats The Policy? She told me you can Only Get Money from the ATM outside. Ive never felt more disrespected in my life. Why? What policy? 



And for the money to be held ; holding me up from my conducting my family business XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. is horrible. We have to pay a car off that comes with late fees if it doesnt get purchased within a short time period or potentially lose the car totally. 

I feel violated of some many levels as a man who does good business I like to keep those same ties as this is a new venture that is being ruined on their behalf. 

I felt like I was prejudiced. Treated unprofessionally and stereotyped by the service managers personal beliefs over the consistute over the rules that govern the bank as I expressed my dire need of the funds to conduct major business for my family company. But this is my second trust issue with the bank which is why I changed my direct deposit from them prior to this. 

But to be denied my funds To Run my familys company and conduct my day to day business as a small business owner is vital. But I asked to be treated with decency when I come into the bank in my pajamas before I get dressed for the day. 
As I get treated when I come into the bank with my clothes on. Thats fair, professional, trusted, leading business as opposed to bias based assumptions that cripple small businesses to paperwork!!! 

I would definitely like this bank to compensate me for all lost damages and time and treat me as a valued customer with respect and decency. They made me raise my voice in public to ask a question."
2266,"I don't know if this constitutes a scam, but it sure seems like it. A few years ago Wells Fargo opened a new separate credit card for my wife when I only wanted another card for her which we requested when we opened the account ... That just made me mad because it could effect credit scores. Now.. today, XX/XX/2018 I went to the Wells Fargo branch in XXXX XXXX , AZ ( I have been a WF customer for about 8 years ) to send a wire transfer to my stock broker and  when asked for ID I presented my driver 's license ( w/photo ), my military post access card ( w/photo ), and my law enforcement badge and state issued AZ Ranger ID ( w/photo ). I was told they required my debit card ( which I have not activated and NEVER use ). I believe this requirement is just another WF scam to require people to use debit cards to collect more fees??? I am switching banks to a more reasonable and customer friendly bank. It just seems wrong."
2269,InXX/XX/2021 my stimulus check was stolen by peers of mine. They then signed my check with my name and took the stimulus to a wells fargo atm. They then deposited the check into the atm and deposited my government check with my name only on it into an account which my name was not present on. Wells fargo is claiming no responsibility in the misuse of my stimulus in the amount {$5600.00}. I believe it is there job to protect me as their customer. Their system failed and allowed my check to be deposited into an account of another Individual therefore they are responsible.
2270,"This is in reference to Wells Fargo : On XXXX XXXX I purchased for {$850.00} what was suppose to be and engine ; paid for through Wells Fargo 's app using XXXX. XXXX ; the representative ; phone number XXXX ; calls back on XX/XX/21 and stated that the engine had no compression, thus they needed to refund me back. He sent me to his "" refund dept ''. They took 2 hours to /supposedly refund my money back, but turns out ; they were using the XXXX app to obtain another {$850.00} and {$970.00}. 

I caught the last two transaction BEFORE they were complete and called Wells Fargo to tell them to stop the transactions they were a scam. Wells told me they could not due to the money was going through XXXX. Wells Fargo told me to file a fraud case and I did for all of these transactions. I was then told that Wells couldn't promise that i could recover my money ; all the while they were packing on overdraft payments left and right!!! 

I then called my local Wells Fargo. I explained to them how their representatives were so rude and how they told me I probably would not get my money back. They filed a complaint to their complaint department due to the disrespect I incurred from various Wells Fargo representatives as well as for the way the fraud case was being handled. 
After waiting almost 2 weeks ; I then contacted the "" complaint Dept '' and was told via XXXX, one attorney that basically I was screwed ... They would not/ could not get my money back. She stated that it was evident that I was scammed but they could not recover my money. However, she gave me a number to XXXX. I reached out to XXXX ; the rep from XXXX informed me that they usually don't work with customers of the Banks ... But then she went on to say Wells filed the case improperly, it should have been filed as scam transactions. 
I then called the complaint line back and asked to speak with XXXX 's supervisor, and spoke with XXXX. I explained to him how rude XXXX was and what the XXXX representative stated. He reopened the case and instructed them to file it as a scam case. 
I spoke with XXXX, another of Wells Fargo lawyer ; today, she told me that they tried to get the money back from the bank that the money was sent to and that bank refused the refund. I asked if she filed it through XXXX as the scam case ; she stated that I would need to reach out to XXXX. I explained to her that the last time the XXXX Representative told me that Wells Fargo should be the ones reaching out to them. 
I, However, did try to call XXXX, multiple times today, XXXX is unreachable. 

Wells Fargo has within their app, and advertises to send money using XXXX, assessable vie the Wells Fargo app. However, after using the way they suggest to send money the first time to buy the engine and then loosing more money they declare that they are not responsible for returning my money back. 
Wells Fargo is misrepresenting this app to customers and refuses to stand behind the transactions using the app that they suggest AND have attached to their app. As a matter of fact, i thought XXXX was apart of Wells Fargo, at least that's the way it is presented. Only, now when there is a problem do they say basically "" it's not our problem ''."
2271,"On Friday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I got a text message from an individual named XXXX XXXX. He instructed me to go ahead and message an individual named XXXX XXXX about an office manager position for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I went ahead and sent an email to XXXX XXXX, and he got back to me around lunchtime that same day. He explained to me the job details and the process in one email and also attached some documents as well, along with some interview questions. After I received his email, I answered all of his questions. He had also sent me a document that needed to be signed. It was regarding the money that would be sent to me for the office materials needed to perform this position, since I would have been working remotely. Once I had the chance to review it, I signed the document and sent it to him that same evening. The weekend passed and that Monday morning, XX/XX/2021, he sent me an email asking if I was interested in the position still, and I told him I was. From there he proceeded to tell me that he will be sending me a check for the materials needed, and he will provide me with the tracking number once it was sent. I received that check ( {$4900.00} ) the next day on, XX/XX/2021 during lunchtime and I deposited it around XXXX that same afternoon. XXXX ( scammer ) had asked for a screenshot of deposit, so I went ahead and sent it to him. I asked him if he would provide me a detailed list of the items I need to purchase, but he explained that he was already in touch with the vendor for their office and she would take care of it for me. That night he asked me to send an advance payment of {$2000.00} to the vendor through XXXX. I explained to him that I will wait till the check clears and the funds become available tomorrow. The next morning, XX/XX/2021, I saw that the amount was in my account, so I sent the advance payment of {$2000.00}. I bank with Wells Fargo, and they explained that the funds would be in my bank account the next day and so I saw the money in my bank account and thought the check cleared so that is why I sent the money. Once that was sent, after some correspondence, XXXX asked me to send the rest of the payment, which was {$2500.00} to the vendor, so she could have the office equipment sent to me over night. I will go ahead and leave out most of the detail here, but I was not able to go ahead and send the money because XXXX limits the amount that could be sent to a recipient per day. Therefore, I had to wait until the next day, XX/XX/2021 to go ahead and send the rest of the money. When I attempted to send the money again, XXXX explained that I should send it to a different XXXX account. Although this seemed awfully sketchy, I figured it was the company 's money in my account so I couldn't really say no, so I went ahead and tried to send it. Fortunately, XXXX limited the amount to {$2000.00} dollars that day, so I could only send {$2000.00} out of the {$2500.00} requested by the vendor. Because of this, XXXX tried to send me different methods of sending the money, like XXXX or XXXX. That day, I asked XXXX if I could get in touch with the vendor myself because I didn't like the way things were going and he connected me with someone named, XXXX XXXX. I am not sure if it was XXXX posing as that person, but XXXX sent me the second XXXX tag and asked me for the rest of the payment. While all of this was happening, XXXX also told me that "" management '' had accidentally sent me another check for the office materials because of some mix up and asked for me to deposit that check as well. I explained to him I would not deposit it and he didn't reply to me. On Thursday night, XX/XX/2021, around XXXX, I got an email from Wells Fargo letting me know that the initial check deposited had come back unpaid and so they took the money out of my bank account. I quickly called my bank and let them know of the situation! I also emailed XXXX asking what was going on, and he never responded back to me again. The next morning, Friday XX/XX/2021, I emailed XXXX asking if the items were ready to see if she would respond and she did and asked for the final payment of {$500.00}. I then asked her to help me get in touch with XXXX, and told her how the check I received from him had come back unpaid, and that if I could not get in touch with him, I would have no use for the office materials purchased and that I would need my money returned, but she never responded back to me after that. Once it became clear that I wouldn't be hearing from them, I went ahead and did a lot of research to find the phone number for the actual company, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Once I found it, I gave them a call and talked to the director there, and he explained to me how someone named XXXX XXXX was running a scam using their company in the U.S. ( they are located in the XXXX ). The director, XXXX, for the actual XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, explained to me that the company was working with the XXXX police to put a stop to this individual named XXXX, but they couldn't do much since he was located in the U.S. In the initial email, XXXX said that he was located in Florida and the phone number XXXX XXXX contacted me with does have a Florida area code, but I am not sure where they are located. After I reported the fraud to Wells Fargo, they explained someone from the claims department would be giving me a call within 10 business to figure out what happened, but I never received any calls. When I reached out to them after 10 business days, they explained to me the claims have been closed since it was an authorized transaction, even though I was clearly a victim of fraud. They explained to me that they asked the scammer 's bank for the money back and they said no essentially and there was nothing else that could be done."
2273,"On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX  I received a text message from : XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX that read : Wells Fargo Bank : Did you attempt a purchase for {$210.00} at XXXX reply Yes/No or Help for Help or Stop to stop fraud alerts I immediately responded : No Shortly after I received a phone call from an XXXX number that was so like Wells Fargos customer service number that I was later told by them it was only XXXX digit off. 

When I answered the phone, the caller explained that they were Wells Fargo contacting me about a suspicious transaction to which I responded no ( that it was unauthorized ) in the text message. He explained as a banker would that there was someone in Texas trying to make a purchase in XXXX XXXX using my information in their digital wallet. He proceeded to tell me to wait as he pulled up the exact information. He then told me it was someone by the name of XXXX XXXX and that he was going to take a closer look into my account to see if there were any other suspicious activities. As he put me on hold my entire thought process was around how my bank was protecting me from a scammer and how relieved I was to have that protection. 

The banker returned to the phone after a minute of putting me on hold. He first asked me To confirm my account balances. Next, he explained that there were in fact XXXX more suspicious transactions, however this time on my XXXX account. He went on to tell me that the scammer sent XXXX XXXX transactions, the first for {$1800.00} which was in processing, and a second smaller amount for {$500.00} that the scammer was hoping would go straight through. However, he explained they were both in processing still. Next, the banker explained that because XXXX is a third-party app to Wells Fargo the only way to reverse the funds was to transfer the money back to me and to sign myself up on my XXXX. This is simple and only asks for a name and phone number to which I saw no harm in and did. 

At this point, I am very distraught I had just received a paycheck and was so relieved that my bank prevented this scammer from stealing my money. My thoughts were crazy, I was tired and felt under attack. I believed everything I was told on the phone. I didnt share any of my personal information. 

The XXXX thing I was tricked into doing was sharing a verification code that was sent via a text message from XXXX XXXX. I was told that was the bank that is registered with XXXX and the only way to reverse my funds back to me. 

I still had not shared any personal information. The final step to get the transfer to reverse was to send me the money to which I saw no harm in doing it was to myself! When I selected my name under my XXXX recipients and went into the next window it was the name XXXX XXXX XXXX the name I was given as the scammer at the beginning of the conversation. I responded alarmed saying it was that name and not mine. He told me not to worry about it that it was the scammer in my account, and it is still attached to me not them. With totally XXXX trust I transfers the money both {$1800.00} and {$500.00} which I believed was to myself. 

The banker told me he was going to transfer me out of the fraud department to speak with another Wells Fargo banker about canceling my debit card, changing my account password, and ordering new cards. I was out on hold again for a minute. When he returned, he said that there was an extremely high call volume and that he could schedule a call back with a banker. I was feeling highly anxious at this point and hung up the phone. 

Even though it took me a while to realize I was scammed I did immediately call Wells Fargo to speak with another representative who could verify all of this. Of course, the customer service line was busy, and I could not get anyone on the phone immediately. I literally waited for almost an hour before speaking with a customer service representative. At this point it had set in that I was scammed and filed a fraud claim. I explained everything that happened to the representative in tears! It was devastating to hear that the response was that Wells Fargo has XXXX days to respond and I would just have to wait until they finished the investigation. 

The following XXXX I called Wells Fargo to get an update. I spoke with a customer representative who told me that my claim was never filed, and I had to refile. To which I was very XXXX, and my XXXX level went way up again. I retold the story of what happened to me and was told that they had XXXX  days again. I waited until early the following week to call again and speak to another representative. She told me that they had no updates and to check back in later. I waited several more days now it had been XXXX days. This time when I called, I was transferred to several different people, none of whom had any information other than that they filed a Courteous Claim with the other bank and it was up to them to respond. All we can do at this point is wait. I argued with the XXXX customer service representative that this is not acceptable. I begged him to call the other bank for me or to tell me what I can do for myself to retrieve my money. He gave no suggestions other than to wait. 

I couldnt accept this from my bank and felt a need to further explain to them. I explained that the person was scripted to a XXXX as a banker, spoke like a banker, said all the things bankers do such as to look on the back of my card at the number and to call if I had any concerns or wanted to verify anything with Wells Fargo. I have heard the same exact things he said from Wells Fargo customer service. He then asked me if I thought the scammer was an actual Wells Fargo banker. After giving it thought, I responded with an honest yes. My response was from the fact that there was someone elses name in my XXXX account behind my name. I didnt do that and dont have the technology to do that. It was the whole reason I got scammed. I again never shared any of my personal information. 

After responding that I believed it to be a banker and only after then was when he agreed to escalate my claim. 

I finally felt like I was getting the attention I needed from my bank after weeks of waiting and hours on the phone and I could breathe a sigh of relief. I truly felt that if Wells Fargo investigated this closely, they could see that it was a scam and be able to track the scammer down and retrieve my money. XXXX XXXX offer this protection to their customers is what I truly believed. I then had to wait again for another investigation to proceed. I was given a letter from the investigator explaining that she was determined to get a solution for me and that she may call me for questions but that I would hear from her by the XXXX with a resolution and included her contact number. 

I gave it several days and never got a call so decided to call as I wanted to speak with the new investigator and make sure she didnt have questions or need clarity from me. No answer, I left a voicemail. Never got a callback but instead several days later another message asking for more time and that I would get a resolution now by the XXXX ( over a month after the fraud! ). 

After all this effort and waiting and pain, I received a final letter from Wells Fargo saying that they were satisfied with the initial resolution on my claim because I initiated the transaction. 

I am left feeling like they literally did nothing to help me. I gave them the name the scammer gave me, XXXX XXXX, the phone number I was text messaged from, along with the phone number I was called from ( both different numbers ). It was a XXXX after bank hours and the customer service phone line was jammed for over an hour. There was literally nothing I could do for myself and there was no help from the bank. I never received a personal phone call from anyone from Wells Fargo, they literally treated me like I was the scammer."
2274,"I transferred money from my Wells Fargo Checking account to my landlord for a lease. I called in to make sure I was doing the online transfer correctly. The Wells Fargo employee walked me through the process and told me funds would be available the next day as long as I made it before the cut off time. The end bank was XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX XXXX was the intermediate bank. I entered my landlords information into the online system and it showed up as XXXXXXXX XXXX 

The funds never made it to his bank. I called Wells Fargo 3 days later they said it was completed and the money was at XXXX XXXX. I tried to call XXXX XXXX but they would not give me any information because I do not have an account with them. They told me Wells Fargo would have to call them. Wells fargo opened the case 3 days after the transfer. The case was opened XX/XX/2021. They said it would take up to 10 days and someone would call me to let me know what was going on. Nobody called. From that date until today XX/XX/2021 Wells Fargo has not called. During that time I called multiple times to get an update. Each time I called I was transferred at least 2 times. The employees told me they can not directly contact the department handling the case. 

Most of the employees have been nice and understand the bad situation the bank has put me in. Its just the processes they are using wont allow them to do anything. I have spoke with 2 employees that had an attitude from the beginning and 1 even hung up on me."

After the transfer wire he informed me that the XXXX XXXX had to return his vacation funds so that i had to get involved as a beneficiary in order to use my XXXX bank account to receive his funds there because of him being at a war zone and having his account blocked.

I requested XXXX XXXX XXXX to trace the wired transfer and I have it in writing that Wells Fargo deposited the money to one of its clients that have the same account number as me.

My elderly mothers health is deteriorating because of this, the amount of XXXX she is dealing with not knowing if she will ever recover the money. And Wells Fargo simply doesnt care for fixing it. 
Please, I need that money to be retrieved and to be deposit correctly. Whats the point of asking for so much information for the transaction if Wells Fargo doesnt verify it! Who is the beneficiary that Wells Fargo keeps stating in the internal messages that sent? 
This is fraud from Wells Fargo. 
I really want a solution. 
Thank You."
2286,"I was victim of ID theft. I first got a letter from the bank "" XXXX XXXX '' claiming that I recently had open an account with the. This account was not opened by me. The person who took my identity seem to have taken all my credentials from my XXXX. This includes my Username and Password for the Wells Fargo App. The hacker was able to link the fraudulent account from XXXX XXXX to my actual wells Fargo App and account. From this, the person made a online transfer from my Wells Fargo account to the fraudulent XXXX account of {$4800.00}. This happened on XX/XX/XXXX and I was not aware of it until 2 days later on XX/XX/XXXX. I opened a case with my bank on the XXXX and at the same time I was on the phone, the person commenting fraud tried to transfer more money to another account for the amount of {$18000.00} but I was on the phone with a represented and they stopped the second attempt. This serves proof to show that someone had my info and was trying to take money out. I opened a case but wells Fargo was no help at all and they seem to shy away from taking the customers side. They denied my claim because they said whoever made the transaction had my credentials ... obviously, the hacker took all my personal information and that included my log in. Wells Fargo does not take in consideration of hackers or id theft and is very misleading. They would always tell me that I would receive a call back from their department but never got back to me. This happened at least 3 times and I had to always give them a call back. I went to an actual branch 3 times and only once was I treated right. I tried to tell them and provide them with more information and paperwork but they would say we will call you when we need it, and never called. I have been trying to work it out with them but they do not seem to even want to help. I opened and reopened the case with them but always got the same response even after numerus calls. It almost seems like they want the client to get bored and exhausted of fighting and they hope we just give up on our money.

I have dual XXXX  and American citizenship.

In addition to the missing amount, I find myself in XXXX with no money I need to live, and I'm afraid to make another transfer because the same thing could happen. I contacted Wellsfargo bank customer service and they tell me that there is a third bank in XXXX that has blocked this wire transfer for reasons they don't know of, and that bank wired the money back with that {$810.00} fee. But they were unable to explain anything else, who the bank is and why that happened. Wellsfargo takes no responsibility. The Italian bank never received anything. What can I do? I need money here to live and I have no help and no number to call.

2296,"Step 1 What is this complaint about? 

Failure of a bank for follow a policy personally told to me by the Teller Supervisor when depositing a check. This failure to follow bank policy erroneously led me to believe a fraudulent check was in fact a good and transfer {$500.00} to the giver of check via XXXX. The bank was unable to craw-back the XXXX payment and refuses to take responsibility for their failure to follow bank policy which now has cost me {$500.00} in lost funds. 

Step 2 What type of problem are you having? 

The bank refuses to acknowledge their failure to follow stated bank policy cost me {$500.00} in lost funds. They say their failure to follow stated policy which cost me {$500.00} is not their responsibility and refuse to compensate me for their mistake ( by crediting my account for the {$500.00} ). 

Step 3 What happened? 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a check for the purchase of car plus transportation costs from a buyer. I went the bank to deposit the check ( {$4900.00} on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX on the enclosed statement ) and given the amount of the check, the window teller called over Teller Supervisor for approval. The Teller Supervisor inspected the check and asked me if I had deposited check from this same party and bank before and said no. She had the window teller look-up the check on a data base and evidently found no adverse information. The Teller Supervisor told me it would take up to 7-10 days for the check to clear given the potential for fraud. I told her I certainly understood the bank policy on holding check and with that condition my deposited was accepted. That evening the check shown as pending with no funds credited to my account. 

Early in the morning of XX/XX/XXXX I checked my bank statement and to my surprise the check had been cleared and all the funds were available. Given overnight clearing meets the criteria of 7-10 days maximum to clear the check I assumed the check had properly cleared and the funds were good. At the request of the car buyer I transferred {$500.00} via XXXX for transportation costs. I then went to the supermarket to purchase some groceries and found my debit card attached to account would not work and my account was over drawn. 

Returning home I check my bank statement online and found XXXX XXXX had reversed the {$4900.00} deposit. I drove to the bank to meet with a banker to explore this problem further. While waiting in line outside the bank I happened to recognize the Teller Supervisor who was leaving and explained to her what happened. She now told me that for long-term customers like myself the bank will sometimes credit my account before funds are actually received from the issuing bank. I told no mention was made of this fact when deposited the check and second this policy actually does a disservice to customers because now I have no way of knowing if a checked has been cleared or not. Further, I pointed only the bank say if a check has cleared or not given that I, as a customer, have no visibility into the clearing process. She basically had no response to my statements. 

I then meet with a Banker and related what happen as described above. The conversation then moved on the same discussion I had with the Teller Supervisor. Again, like the Teller Supervisor, he no answer as why the bank would credit my account for a check which was supposed to be held for 7-10 days. While I was meeting with him he filed a report with the bank fraud unit as to the circumstances of the XXXX transfer but the fraud unit was able to secure return of the {$500.00}. 

In reading the enclosed bank statement, please note although the days are reverse chronological order the transaction for each day are chronological order. On XX/XX/XXXX the {$500.00} XXXX transfer was made before the bank reversed the {$4900.00} deposit. 

In summary, the bank did not follow its stated policy of holding checks for 7-10 days and the a mistake of prematurely crediting my account for {$4900.00} led me to falsely believe the check had cleared, which led me to transfer {$500.00} via XXXX under fraudulent conditions unknown to me at the time. When discovered, the bank now refuses to take responsibility for their actions which caused me to lose {$500.00}. 

Step 4 What company is this complaint about? 

Wells Fargo Bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX Step 5 Who are the people involved? 

Teller Supervisor : Name unknown, middle-aged XXXX-American female, height XXXX XXXX, weight approximately XXXX pounds. 

Banker : XXXX XXXX,"
2297,"I sent money from XXXX for someone online sell glove but after I sen money she did blocked me on XXXX, I called my bank wellsfargo stop the transfer but they cant"
2298,"XX/XX/2021 XXXX I walked over to wells Fargo as instructed by the representative that answered the phone. The direct branch was called XXXX. My good friend had a XXXX  XXXX and is in the hospital. My friend Mr. XXXX XXXX wrote a check to me. The representative that answered told Mr. XXXX that I can come to the bank with two forms of ID and debit card. I have now been sitting here over an hour. Whom Mr. XXXX spoke with will not speak up as the person whom he talked to. I have him on standby and then had him call the bank. The check is for {$2500.00} to me I brought my ids and Mr. XXXX called but they are not cashing it They ate not even addressing me. I am an upstanding XXXX XXXX. I am being treated like a criminal. I don't like the looks I m getting and nothing is being done. I am tiny, blonde, I have XXXX XXXX  and I feel like I am being judged. As I sit here no one is addressing me we are going on 2 hours. The check is made out to me I have ID. The check is real and not fraud. I feel this is being done because of how I look. 
I sat there fir three hours and in the end treated like a criminal. That check was 1000 % authentic. I had my IDs. The Manager came out to me in lobby after sitting there for almost 3 hours not being addressed at all. I can hear the comments and whispers yet not one employee has addressed me. The Bank XXXX comes out with check in her hand. She says to me. "" I know for a fact that this check is fraudulent. You are trying to commit a fraudulent act in my bank. I am not honoring this check and we will not cash it. Then she flung the check in my face. I told her that the man who wrote the check is across the street in the hospital. I told her he needs to have some cash and was supposed to buy him some clothes. The Manager then again said the check is fraud we will not honor the check. I grabbed the check and told her the check was legit and I will be back. There were people in the bank and employee 's. I felt embarrassed I felt that I was being judged and I was treated like a criminal and I am not. 
The man who wrote the check who was in the hospital from having a XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. He writes with right hand which means he cant write. I explained this to the Bank manager. The man Mr. XXXX XXXX called the bank to tell her to honor the check. She informed him that she can not cash a check without proper ID 's. I brought proper IDs. I was on the level. I was not committing. A crime and was not treated respectfully. I was discriminated and character was ( defamation )."
2300,"XXXX confirmed in XXXX way call with Wells Fargo Bank and scammer that fraudulent activity as happening on my account. 

XXXX filed claim with Wells Fargo Bank for fraudulent activity. 

Called XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX requesting to speak with supervisor/ investigators. Advised to pull the call on XX/XX/XXXX between real Wells Fargo representative and scammer. Requested fax or email to send proof that the fraudulent call came from Wells Fargo number. Advised under Regulation E ; should be protected. 
- On every call Wells Fargo would not allow me to send proof of scam. They would not allow me to speak with investor. They advised twice a supervisor would call, no one ever called. They would not listen to the recorded call in XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX received denial. Requested to file an appeal. Was advised, if they file an appeal, the same outcome will happen. They would not reopen claim."
2303,"I received a fraudulent cashiers check and the bank processed the amount of {$8900.00} after I deposited it in the Wells Fargo XXXX on XX/XX/2021. It went into my account and i was asked to pay {$3800.00} for fees by the scammer. I did so on XX/XX/2021. Later that evening the bank took the {$8900.00} out of my account flagging it as not legitimate and needed until XX/XX/2021 to verify. However by then, the payment i sent out subtracted causing my account to be out into the negative by thousands of dollars. I contacted the bank and all they told me was to file a police report and there was nothing to do to stop the transfer i sent out or cancel anything else."
2304,"On XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX I got a call from XXXX. He told me his name was XXXX XXXX and he was calling from Wells Fargo Fraud Department and there was fraudulent transactions being made on my debit card and if I could verify it was me. There were XXXX transactions he named that he said were made in Georgia. One was for {$200.00} one was for {$3000.00} and one was for {$500.00}. I declined that any of them were me since I live in Pennsylvania. He then told me that he needed to make a new account for me and that I needed to wire my money from my account to my new one having the money be transferred to myself. He told me if we got disconnected his name was XXXX XXXX and gave me a reference number. I wired {$14000.00} over to the account and the phone hung up. When I called back it directed me to Wells Fargo. I thought it was suspicious after he didnt call me back since the number was a Wells Fargo number. I filed a claim with Wells Fargo for wire transfer fraud and the woman I spoke with, XXXX, told me that they disguised the number as Wells Fargo to make it look like it was them really calling."
2306,"On XX/XX/2022, I was a victim of fraud in my Wells Fargo bank accounts. Someone obtained my identity and deposited several fake money orders to my account. The fuel lost my email"
2310,"I filed a complaint with wells Fargo on XX/XX/ 2021 about an unauthorized transaction from XXXX XXXX. I told Wells Fargo my information was completely compromised due to an XXXX hack that occurred earlier this year which Im still recovering from. I waited for my XXXX business for this thing to get resolved but on the XXXX  day, I received a voicemail. It was a wells Fargo investigator. I felt like I was treated like someone who was less than a customer. All I was met with was nothing but dead-end answers and hostility. I felt hopeless at that moment like everything was crashing down. I explained what happened and didnt get any results or helpful information. I was told to contact uphold directly so I decided to do that, that same day. Uphold customer service reps took forever to get back to me. The emails felt like a lifetime apart. I kept telling the reps that I didnt make any transactions and that wells Fargo reps told me to contact them. I was looking for a resolution but was quickly shut down and was told they were closing an account I never made. After a few backs and forth emails, I was told to contact Wells Fargo to get my money back. Wells Fargo said the same thing to me and told me to go to uphold to get my money back. I feel like Im just getting bullied by XXXX  big companies with no care in the world. This isnt right and they feel like theyre untouchable. I feel hopeless and lost and need the help of the XXXX"
2312,"Between XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, someone was able to access my banking information and was able to take over my account completely. 

Whoever took over my account committed credit card fraud by purchasing random items online : XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc. Most of those charges have been refunded. The "" scammers '' also used my credit card to send cash advances over XXXX and bank wire transfers to themselves. 

The XXXX payments began on XX/XX/XXXX when {$500.00} was transferred from my credit card into my savings and then transferred to a XXXX XXXX. Another transfer to XXXX XXXX followed on XX/XX/XXXX, again financed from my credit card. Two more XXXX cash advances followed on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to a XXXX XXXX ( again {$500.00} each ) ; the XX/XX/XXXX transfer was funded from my checking account when {$490.00} was transferred from my checking into my savings. For the XX/XX/XXXX transfer, there was no accompanying transfer from my credit card. And finally, one last XXXX {$500.00} transfer to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( from my CC ). The total was five separate {$500.00} XXXX transfers. 

Along with the XXXX transfers, another {$1900.00} cash advance was sent to a XXXX XXXX  in Ohio. 

Each of these cash advances from my credit card had cash advance fees that followed : {$25.00} for the {$500.00} transfers on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX. 
{$98.00} for the {$1900.00} What these people then did was transfer money from my savings to pay off my credit card, whether this was to try to prevent me or Wells Fargo from seeing what was happening to my account, I do not know. 

These transfers occurred on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX {$840.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$3100.00} So, over ten days, my Savings balance went from {$10000.00} to {$5800.00}, and my Checking balance went from {$590.00} to {$100.00} And my Credit Card balance had gone from {$470.00} to {$1800.00}. 

I will include all of the documentation that will show this. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I realized I could no longer log into my Wells Fargo app on my phone, and when I could not log in on my computer, I called Wells Fargo. They transferred me directly to the fraud department, where I spoke with someone who specifically asked me about the XXXX payments and if I knew the people who had received XXXX payments from me. They closed all three accounts ( my savings/checking/and credit card ) and transferred them to new accounts. During this time, I asked why I wasn't contacted about any of these transfers, which were a huge departure from my typical account activity. The Wells Fargo phone operator told me that they did try to contact me. That's when I noticed my phone number and email address had been changed. When they said everything should be back to normal, I looked and saw that my savings was nearly {$5000.00} lighter, and my checking was {$500.00} lighter. They told me that I should go into a Wells Fargo bank which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. ( Case number XXXX ) I left Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX under the impression that everything would be resolved in 7 - 10 business days. -- see attachment titled In branch visit XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, I received 5 letters from Wells Fargo, all dated from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

The first denied the claim that I had filed on XX/XX/XXXX on the phone, it labeled the transactions as XXXX Inter - XXXX Debit to XXXX XXXX  XXXX The other transaction was XXXX {$2000.00} to XXXX XXXX  XXXX There was never a {$2000.00} transfer to XXXX XXXX  so I don't even know what they were claiming to be denying. The reason that they gave was "" we have determined that the transactions were made by you or someone who had your authorization funds ''. ( Case number XXXX has been denied ) -- see attachment titled First Letter XX/XX/XXXX The second letter informed me that the funds would be deducted from my account ( including the {$2000.00} to XXXX XXXX  that didn't exist ). -- see attachment titled Second Letter XX/XX/XXXX The third letter was a result of my visit to the branch on the XXXX. Me not knowing how cash advances worked, I claimed the {$3600.00} on my credit card as fraud. That was denied because it was transferred into my savings before being transferred out to XXXX or XXXX XXXX. -- see attachment titled Third Letter XX/XX/XXXX The fourth letter was an additional transaction form that asked if there were any additional transactions on my credit card that Wells Fargo had missed. There were four charges that the in-person banker at Wells Fargo and XXXX missed on XX/XX/XXXX. I faxed that form on XX/XX/XXXX. -- see attachment titled Fourth Letter and fax confirmation The final letter asked me to enclose an Affidavit of Online Fraud ( for the online banking ) for case number XXXX, which in retrospect doesn't make sense because the claim had already been denied, and now I'm being asked to fill out an Affidavit. Regardless, I filled out the Affidavit and will attach it here ; it mostly outlines everything I covered in the summary above. I faxed this on the XXXX as well. -- see attachments titled Fifth letter and Affidavit of Online Fraud On XX/XX/XXXX, I also called the Wells Fargo fraud department again and spoke to a representative named XXXX. At this point, I still didn't grasp what had happened, the cash advances confused me, the denials confused me, but I filed a different claim thinking that I had filed an incorrect complaint somehow based on what she said. 

XXXX was unable to help me capture the scope of what had happened. On XX/XX/XXXX, I claimed 3 of the {$500.00} transfers from my Credit Card to the savings as fraudulent. While I did not authorize these, they were transfers from my credit card to my savings. ( Claim XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) that the claim had also been denied. Within 24 hours, my new claim was denied. The Affidavit I filled out had not been consulted ( I do not know this for sure, but since I faxed the Affidavit on XX/XX/XXXX and the denial letter was typed up on XX/XX/XXXX, it seems unlikely ). -- see attachment titled XX/XX/XXXX Claim Denial Nevertheless, I ended the day on the XXXX and XXXX hopefully that this would end up being resolved. When I received the denial claim on the XXXX, I called on the online fraud department again. At the same time, I filed a complaint. 

The person that I spoke to on the XXXX ( XXXX XXXX was helpful and helped me articulate the scope of what had happened. At this point, I was concerned that these claims were being denied because if each individual transaction is looked at as fraudulent, then it would seem that I am claiming upwards of {$9000.00} - which I was not. 

It was difficult for me to grasp what had been taken, but on the XXXX, that was fully articulated. ( On the final page of the Affidavit, there is an explanation of this balancing act, my savings statement from XXXX serves as a good indication of this "" balancing act. '' During the first three cash advances, my savings balance did not change because my credit card was financing the cash advances ). -- see attachment titled XXXX Savings Statement On the XXXX, I also filed a complaint with Wells Fargo because of the amount of time this had taken. Someone from the complaints office emailed me and has attempted to be helpful throughout this process. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo to see if there had been a resolution on the additional credit card fraud that I claimed on XX/XX/XXXX. ( The fourth letter that I received on XX/XX/XXXX that I faxed on XX/XX/XXXX ). I have a fax confirmation, but the person I spoke to told me that it had never been uploaded. So, I had to claim that as fraud ( again ). It is currently seven business days later, and I've had no response, no refund, or no contact. -- see attachment titled Fourth Letter and Fax Confirmation On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to my local Wells Fargo Branch to get an update on the Fraud claim that I filed on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX, the banker, was able to get us in touch by phone with a resolution specialist who said that the fraud claim would be resolved by the XXXX, and I could call on the XXXX. 

I called on the XXXX, hoping for good news. I didn't get it. The fraud claim had been denied on XX/XX/XXXX the reason being : "" biometric data and undisputed transactions ''. The person on the phone told me that I had no other recourse but to write a letter to appeal to the fraud investigator. 
-- see attachment XX/XX/XXXX letter After this latest denial, I researched what other individuals had done when denied by Wells Fargo for fraudulent claims. I have now filed a police report along with this consumer finance complaint and an attorney general 's consumers complaint. I would have done all of these things two months ago if I had any idea that this would still be unresolved. I also pulled my credit report and added a credit freeze. While reviewing my credit report, I noticed an inquiry was made by Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX - the day after the takeover of my accounts began. I am having difficulty understanding why this inquiry was made if Wells Fargo did not believe anything unusual was happening on my accounts. There were 13 transactions made in that ten-day period in my savings account. Typically every month, I have zero or one transaction in my savings account. In the last nine months, I have only had nine total transactions in my savings account ( not including auto payments or direct deposits ). My monthly activity for the eight years I have been with Wells Fargo has never involved cash advances or frequent XXXX payments ( I've made two XXXX payments in total during my years with Wells Fargo ). If Wells Fargo looked into my account on XX/XX/XXXX, why wasn't anything further done to ensure my accounts were safe. -- - see attachments titled WF inquiry with address and police report and Texas Attorney General Consumer Complaint"
2313,"On XX/XX/XXXX there was a fraudulent XXXX transfer made through my Wells Fargo account for {$300.00}. I called Wells Fargo and disputed the charge on XX/XX/XXXX and was issued a provisional credit. They closed my bank account and canceled my debit card and issued new ones. I had to update all banking information with every company that I pay a bill to or that requires billing information for their services. I received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX stating the investigation into my case was closed and they determined that I made the transaction and WF would be reversing the {$300.00} credit and I had 10 days from the time the letter was mailed to come up with the money. The letter was dated XX/XX/XXXX so I was given 5 days to come up with {$300.00} that I did not need. I immediately called XXXX and was provided with the information that was used for them to make their decision. They stated that because I used biometric facial ID to open my XXXX bank app in my home the same day, that I was liable for the charge and it was not fraudulent. I had the case escalated for it to be reviewed again and I was told obtaining a police report would help my case. I went to the XXXX XXXX, TN police department on XX/XX/XXXX and filed a police report and sent it over to XXXX. I then received a letter in the mail that was dated XX/XX/XXXX and it stated they received my complaint and were looking into it. I then received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX which stated the decision was still final and that when the money was sent that I had agreed to an addendum that XXXX has with XXXX. I did not send the money so I did not agree to anything which was the whole point of filing the dispute. I then filed a complaint with the XXXX and received another letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that they received my complaint and were investigating. I received another letter that was dated XX/XX/XXXX that stated more time was needed to investigate my claim. I waited and then received notice on XX/XX/XXXX that my claim was still denied once again because of using biometric facial ID to open my banking app on the day the transaction was made and that their location services put the transaction as being made in my location. No further evidence was given to me that influenced their decision. I stated that I wanted the issue escalated further because I was not happy with the outcome. I was told that I could speak with a manager but they would just transfer my case back to XXXX XXXX who had been handling my case since the beginning. I told them I would be closing my account and intended on pursuing this further. I then filed another complaint with the XXXX  because of my experience with them and the fact that I did not send this money. I do not know the person the money was sent to and I did not file a false police report. Wells Fargo not only took {$300.00} of my money and refuse to give it back but they overdrew my bank account by {$200.00} when they reversed the credit they issued. I told them they would overdraw my account and all they said was 'you won't be charged any overdraft fees '. So I'm out {$500.00} and they refuse to help me and I've been a customer for 15 years."
2314,"On XX/XX/XXXX I deposited a check from my school into my checking account via Wells Fargos mobile bank deposit. 
On XX/XX/XXXX My car was broken into where the check was located and it was stolen. 
On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo notified me that the check had been deposited twice and the amount of the check was debited from my checking account. I immediately filed a claim/dispute. I also filed a police report because I did not know anything was stolen from my vehicle until they notified me that the check was deposited more than once. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received notification of the resolution of my claim. Which only stated that my check had been deposited into another Wells Fargo customers account and they would not be restoring the funds to my account. I called and escalated the claim and they told me since my initial deposit was via mobile deposit and the second deposit was using the physical check there was nothing that they could do. Even though the check was written out to me and endorsed by me and matching the name on my bank account. 
It is now XX/XX/XXXX and Ive tried to escalate multiple times offering to provide proof of the police report and everything and I just keep getting the same response. Wells Fargo was my first bank and Ive been with them since XXXX. Absolutely disgusted with how they have handled this situation"
2315,"This is NOT a duplicate of a prior complaint : The following is a cursory narrative and chronology of wire fraud committed against my wife and me. Very specific detail is available upon request. 

The attached files will provide evidence of the movement of monies via wire between XXXX Bank and Wells Fargo Bank. The monies were wired to complete a closing of the purchase of a house to replace the home we had sold just a few days earlier the same week. 

In the RF to WFC file, the first page is the original wire transfer request with all detail of the transaction on XX/XX/2021. The first email and wiring instructions were fraudulent, and the second email and wiring instructions were authentic, sent one day later. 

The Letterhead Detective file is evidence that the XXXX Sheriffs office ( Detective XXXX XXXX ) is involved, as well as the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX office ( Special Agent XXXX XXXX ). 

The Complaint resolution file from Wells Fargo shows their final response to our complaint to them to return the wired funds to XXXX Bank. 

The Regions Account file is a line item accounting of the outgoing and incoming wire transfers. 

The Real Estate Docs file is the cover page of the purchase contract of the original house we were going to buy on XX/XX/2021, the cancellation doc of that house purchase due to Wells Fargo reluctance to return our funds and, finally, the cover page of the contract for the house we had to buy in another city ( after 40 years in XXXX XXXX XXXX!! ) after our original house deal was cancelled for undue delays by Wells Fargo. 
The second house purchase price exceeded the first by {$43000.00}. 

The Moving Storage file has receipts for excessive moving and storage activity required after cancellation of the first house contract due to delay by Wells Fargo. 


Chronology : After sale of our original house on XX/XX/2021, monies were transferred into the Regions checking acct in my wife 's name. 

We were to close on XX/XX/2021 on the house to replace our sold home. 

On XX/XX/2021, we received the fraudulent email with fraudulent wiring instructions. 

On XX/XX/2021, my wife XXXX went to Regions bank and wired {$180000.00} to Wells Fargo for the closing ... ..so we thought. 

On XX/XX/2021, in the afternoon, I called XXXX XXXX to confirm receipt of the funds for closing on XX/XX/2021. I was told that Ark Title does NOT use Wells Fargo for closings. I immediately called the local branch of Wells Fargo and instructed them to freeze the account the funds were wired into ... .at that point, they confirmed the funds were there and that the account had a "" hard hold '' placed on it to secure the funds. 

As I was calling Wells Fargo, XXXX went to XXXX Bank and they issued a recall of the wire at that moment. Within a few days, they responded to Wells Fargo and issued Hold Harmless letters to them to facilitate the return of the wired funds. 

From XX/XX/2021 through the end of XXXX, I spent XXXX hours per day calling every department at Wells Fargo only XXXX be blocked and sand-bagged by dozens of clerks, supervisors, and essentially every person I spoke with at the bank. These people were strewn from the XXXX XXXX, to XXXX XXXX, to XXXX, to California, to Idaho, and on to Montana. 

Only one person was honest and forthcoming about this episode. He confirmed the hard hold on the account on XX/XX/2021, and several subsequent withdrawals by the person ( California female ) to whom the account was registered long after the hold was placed on the account. The withdrawals ended after her debit card was revoked on XX/XX/2021. 

For the next two weeks, our complaint received many case numbers which were continually closed and passed on to the next "" brick wall ''. When I happened upon the honest fellow, amazingly Wells Fargo wired {$170000.00} back to XXXX Bank the next day, XX/XX/2021. 



So after 26 days of stalling and shoving us off to the next purveyor of nonsense, we had lost our new house, been forced to remove furnishings and stored boxes from that house into another storage facility, give up some of the earnest money, search for another house in a ridiculous real estate market ( cost another {$43000.00} above the price of the first house, and in another city across the state ), not to mention being shorted {$5900.00} of the original wired funds ... ... .what a nightmare!!!! 

This is the first time I've had to sit down and figure the damage caused by the ongoing mismanagement and absolute heartless nonsense that came out of Wells Fargo : Totalling the items cited above, it amounts to {$55000.00}, not to mention two months of sleepless nights. 

I am XXXX years old, and my wife just turned XXXX ... ..at this point it's going to be difficult to gain back the money lost due to the damages of this action by Wells Fargo XXXX 

At this point in time, the return of the funds that were shorted from the original wired amount would help our situation. THIS SHORTFALL AMOUNTS TO {$5900.00} ... .this is STILL BEING HELD BY WELLS FARGO. 

Any assistance you can provide will be greatly appreciated.

2316,"One XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted via phone from Wells Fargo Fraud toll free number. ( I called this number from another phone to verify that the number was legitimate ). I was asked if I transferred {$3000.00} to a XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Fl using XXXX? I told them no. I had used XXXX early for two transactions and thought that was where the breech took place. I was advised in order to get the funds back to my account, I would have to XXXX the money back to myself in two {$1500.00} increments. I did as I was told. They told me they would contact me again on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX pm which they did. They then advised that I would have to XXXX another {$500.00} to myself and this is when I realized something wasnt legitimate. After filing a claim with Wells Fargo, they stated that they would investigate. After 9 days, Wells Fargo advised that per XXXX the money was non-returnable. I then filed another complaint with Wells Fargo directly. They have not returned the money and I am unable to get any answers. I have read several articles and under Regulation E it appears that it should be covered. Wells Fargo is stating that XXXX is a third party and my money is not insured. XXXX is an app that Wells Fargo has endorsed. I have no money at this point to pay my bills, and unable to pay for my XXXX medication. I have seen where this same issue happens and was investigated by a XXXX news station and the money was returned. I dont have much, but {$3000.00} was all I had. Could you please help?"

I filed complaint requesting records with misapplied interest payments/original bank records be provided along with reconciliations documents and audit findings. My available records where changed showing nothing incorrect or misapplied. They denied my request claiming that per their records no such actions of mis applied interest where ever made by Wells Fargo. After that Wells Fargo sent another letter requesting for me to cash XXXX check AGAIN. They stated via during first checks mail that there was interest made by Wells Fargo holding my monies in accounts other than mine and they additionally wanted to return that amount too. I filed another complaint requesting records. I was told by Managers that per the now available records and past statements they all show changed and correct AGAIN. I filed another complaint. They altered the original transaction bank documents to appear to never misapplied interest. They committed Fraud by altering original transactions records and falsifying transaction records statements. They are refusing to provide my correct factual bank loan statements. They committed Fraud by conversion and made interest off the monies. Denied all requests for Bank records. I'm unable verify if amount provided are correct due to records being changed and withheld.

2320,"Scammers had stolen the identities of several individuals one of which was my friend. I was prompted and encouraged to invest in cryptocurrency by my friend thinking it is actually hee. Little did I know I was being scammed and they somehow were bridging my money transfers to themselves and my money was never being invested in those websites or apps. They were directly stealing it and when I asked for a withdrawal they bribed me for more money. I have never fallen for such scams, but because they had stolen and hacked my friends identity, I thought my money was safe. Especially since the websites seemed legit. The following are the websites : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I used changelly via XXXX to purchase the bitcoin but my money was being wired elsewhere and stolen. Since XXXX is an legitimate website, I did not think my money was disappearing. 

Later my friend was able to get the identity back and sent me a conversation the scammers were having with the fake accounts about scamming me. I took this case to Wells Fargo but they did not get my money back. There was several transactions made to the wallet number XXXX Then, the scammers tried stealing my identity and were constantly trying to log into my personal accounts, especially virtual wallets to get full access. Wells Fargo did absolutely nothing about this claim. A total of $ XXXXwas wired and stolen. 

I have attached a video of the scammers having a conversation. The video was screen recorded by my friend once she got her identity back. The conversation is between her and another account the scammers have hacked which belongs to a young mom. Notice the voice of the scammers are of men with heavy accents and those voices do not belong to either of the ladies. 

I have also attached two videos of the conversation I was having with my Friend whose identity had been stolen and I did not know. I attached another conversation with the scammers who had stolen the young moms identity ( again of which I was clueless )."

I couple days later, I checked my account I saw the was sent twice. I riched out to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to find why this was happened.

2327,"I would like to claim negligence by XXXX. They should protect me as their client ; however, they failed to protect me and fail to investigate the claim. They did not live up the expectation that such big company is expected to give to their client. 
On XX/XX/2021, I was victim of voice phishing. The scammer had spoofed XXXX XXXX  number and I was scammed for {$2000.00}, by XXXX. Right after I realize that was scammed, I called XXXX and was put in hold for more than an hour, so I had no other choice than going to the local XXXX XXXX to explain my situation. They put hold on my account, and I was told to wait that they will investigate my claim. They also told me that I need to go to Wells Fargo bank and to talk to them because the recipient is an account holder at Wells Fargo. I knew this because the person at my local XXXX XXXX  was able to me track the recipient and found a Wells Fargo account as well as the last 4 digits of the account number, also I received multiple emails saying to confirm my account to receive money. We went to Wells Fargo and after checking my info in their databases they concluded the person who scammed me was using my name and email but after checking my socials I did not have any accounts with them, they gave us a phone number to call fraud department. We called and they told us to wait for XXXX XXXX, that they will communicate with each other to investigate the case. I told Wells Fargo that I am certain that the money was transferred to Wells Fargo bank account, because they used my email to open a new account at Wells Fargo. They fraudulently opened an account at Wells Fargo to steal money from me. Thus, Wells Fargo Bank also must be responsible for this claim. 

The next following morning not even after a full 24 hours in the morning, I had received a statement from XXXX through my XXXX mobile app stating that under my authorization and agreement that they will not be taking any action and the inquiry was now closed. This especially confused me since I have never discussed not taking any action and have agreed to close the inquiry. I was assured over the phone by XXXX XXXX  that they would work hand in hand with Wells Fargo and update me on any finds regarding my claim, but I received no updates, no resolutions, just a statement stating that the inquiry was now closed, and they will not be taking any action. I even called after receiving the statement and was put on hold for more than 2 hours and called back the following day, and the lady I was speaking with could not explain in her own words what the resolution was and why my inquiry had been cut short without any investigation. Just repeating the same thing over and over again and I was not satisfied with the answers. It seemed to me that they just wanted to cancel my claim without any right of fair investigation. 

XXXX CLAIM # XXXX"
2328,"In XX/XX/2020, I was scammed on XXXX by a woman named XXXX XXXX, she claimed to help trade with bitcoin and get a large return. I was willing to invest {$500.00} only and let that be known many times. I was told you only pay what you invest, I have all our conversations saved on whats app. After finally setting up initial investment, 7 days went by and I earned a profit of XXXX now when she asks me for money to by the stamp. This made no sense to me so I reached out to another lady on XXXX who claimed to have traded with her in the passed. She told me this was normal. I wire transferred {$1000.00} to an acct in New York. After this I was told now I need to pay the Commission upfront, I explained this was not the arrangement and I cant do it. Told her she was not upfront with me, she then agreed and said she talked to company and they agreed to lessen Commission to {$1000.00}. So I regretfully sent another {$1000.00} same acct. Both XX/XX/2020. Now time to get my profit, was asked what phone I have iphone of well you need an android so go get one and contact me back. I then contacted my bank Wells Fargo to submit fraud claim. I was told I would hear something within 2 weeks. Nothing! I called in XXXX over a XXXX, the lady could find the claim but told me nothing was updated looks like still waiting on community bank in New York. She would refile and get more info and contact me back. I heard nothing, called back end of XXXX and got the same run around. XXXX same finally XXXX get a manager he tells me the reason I hadn't heard anything from XXXX till I called in XXXX cause the claim wasn't started till XXXX, I was fuming mad. Then was transferred again, had to explain same story over and over to different people. My bank wasted months Doing nothing just to finally tell me that the bank in New York says the acct has no funds. My Money was lost nothing they could do. Wells Fargo dropped the ball big time. Each time I called it was like the first time I called giving the fraud company/ people plenty of time to empty acct. please help me. I lost {$2000.00} and {$60.00} in transfer fees.

After some talk I agreed to purchase his item for {$500.00} and sent him a XXXX  transfer thinking XXXX  was a wells fargo service not a separate standalone service. Minutes after sending the payment the man deleted his information including his email associated with XXXX and discord information as well as XXXX information and there's no way to contact him at all and I was scammed entirely out of {$500.00}. I immediately made a claim with wells fargo and they responded by saying they let the sellers institution know of the transaction and its up to them to get him to refund the money... However he deleted his information, he took the money and is gone and i'm out {$500.00}! and instead wells fargo has chosen to just close the claim and not assist at all. I tried calling and the representative was extremely rude and unhelpful and had completely neglected all my concerns with resolving this matter. I asked the rep if there's any information she can provide to me with the institution of the sellers that I can call and speak to them about receiving a refund and she refused to provide information and after I became irate she hung up on me."
2331,"As a victim of Wire Fraud between my Wells Fargo account to a different Wells Fargo account, I feel Wells Fargo did not do enough to protect me from the criminals and is protecting the criminals and themselves over me. I also feel Wells Fargo has been showing no interest in the facts about my case or interest in how I am being treated as their customer. The loss of this money will take me years to recover from and I feel I was given a false sense of protection from being robbed while conducting business entirely within the confines of Wells Fargos system. 

Every step along the way from the investigation and 3 complaints filed on my behalf, no one from Wells Fargo has actually reached out to me to hear the details of the fraud, followed up with me on my complaints, or taken steps to address the issues. The overarching problem is that I am repeatedly given the impression that I dont matter. I lost $ XXXX in this wire fraud that they could have recovered or prevented had they acted as quickly or had the safeguards in place as I was asking them to. 

XX/XX/2021 I was in the final week leading up to a house closing when I reached out to my real estate attorney via email inquiring about closing costs and process. 2 days later ( XX/XX/2021 ) I received a reply on that same email thread coming from my attorneys office email account directing me with instructions on how to submit the closing costs via wire transfer. Unknowingly to me, their email had been compromised and the criminals were providing the wire transfer instructions. Thinking it was my attorneys office, I followed their instructions and ended up wiring $ XXXX ( as a daily limit ) from my Wells Fargo online account to another Wells Fargo account. When the criminals replied they had received the money and provided further instructions on sending the balance due to a different account, I was surprised to see different account information. I called my attorneys office and they had no idea what I was talking about and confirmed the emails were fraudulent and I was directed to immediately call the bank. 

XX/XX/2021 Within 4 hours of the transaction I called Wells Fargos online fraud support line and through various transfers and over a period of 1.5 hours I was given a case number for the recall of funds and told the investigation would take between 5 and 10 days. There was no transparency why I was on hold for so long, why it would take so long to investigate, yet the agent I spoke with that night was assuring me everything would be fine. 

XX/XX/2021 The next morning I engaged with the Department of Justice in my district ( agent XXXX XXXX ) and local XXXX MA police ( detective XXXX XXXX ). The agent at the DOJ had a contact at Wells Fargo and reached out on my behalf with the documentation I provided the DOJ agent to Wells Fargo financial crimes investigator ( XXXX XXXX ). That investigator spoke to me via phone to tell me the email documentation has been received and investigation is underway. I should expect someone to reach out with more information and likely will have to fill out an indemnification form so that I won't sue the bank if the reclaimed money is contested by the recipient. 

XX/XX/2021 On the XXXX day I received a courtesy call ( as stated in the voicemail ) that my case has been assigned to XXXX XXXX. Expecting a call from the inspector but not receiving one, I called Wells Fargo on the XXXX day ( XX/XX/2021 ) for a status update and was told the case has been closed the day before with a denial of reclaiming the stolen funds and a letter sent out with the details of the investigation. At no point did the investigator ever reach out to me for any documents or details of the wire fraud circumstances. I asked to speak with the investigator and received a call back from XXXX XXXX 3 days later ( XX/XX/2021 ). 

XX/XX/2021 XXXX XXXX explained to me he had opened and closed the case on the same day, had not been in contact with the financial crimes investigator, XXXX XXXX, nor had he received any documentation or reached out to me for any details. XXXX XXXX would not provide any details on what happened in the investigation, why they didnt reach out to me, why I was on hold for an 1.5 hours when my initial case was created the night I called in, nor had any interest in receiving any more information from me about this case. XXXX XXXX said he would send my request to the Escalation Team and opened a complaint case. But could not provide a case number or provide a timeframe when I should receive a call or expect a response. 

XX/XX/2021 Four days later I received an email from XXXX @ XXXX with a response attached as a PDF restating their position to close the case with no return of funds. The complaint agent listed on the attachment as XXXX XXXX never reached out to me regarding what I was actually complaining about. XXXX XXXX  letter only addressed that the bank will not return my stolen funds. My attempts to reach out to XXXX XXXX via the listed phone number in the email were unsuccessful. 

XX/XX/2021 The next day via postal mail I finally received the initial letter from XXXX XXXX ( 9 days from when the case was closed ) which contained a one line explanation of why the case was closed : as the money will not be returned from the receiving bank, we are not able to reimburse you. Since Wells Fargo is the receiving bank of the funds, they are taking the position of protecting the criminal activity over me. 

In my attempts to reach XXXX XXXX to challenge the findings of the investigation, I have since had to open 2 other complaints. The subsequent complaint closed by XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/2021 ) had the nearly identical language in the denial of returning the funds nor had XXXX S reached out to me about my complaint. 

At this point I have complaints about the process and the disregard for the factual nature of the investigation, but no one from Wells Fargo has shown any interest in what the content of my complaint is and just responding to whatever the agent decides to enter into the complaint fields. The most recent complaint ( XX/XX/2021 ) that I filed while trying to speak with XXXX XXXX about the case, I was able to get the agent filling out the complaint form to read to me back what the complaint XXXX XXXX closed addressing which also had factually incorrect statements about the circumstances of the case. I was told this third complaint case that I was opening would be responded to within 3 business days and that the agent was including a note not to close the case without speaking with me first. It has been 7 business days and still no response as of XX/XX/2021."

2334,"Re : Bank and XXXX XXXX in Me-To-Me Scams. 
On XX/XX/2022 I received a security text from Wells Fargo XXXX ( XXXX ), informing me that there had been unauthorized card and 'XXXX  XXXX transactions. I checked my bank account and found unauthorized credit card transactions, so I responded "" YES '' to the text. I then received a call from "" XXXX XXXX, Agent ID : XXXX '' who informed me that my debit card had been compromised, and in addition, {$2000.00} had been sent via XXXX to a XXXX XXXX XXXX. He put a pause on my debit card, and had me 'reverse ' the XXXX transactions by sending money to my own zelle account linked to my phone number. I received confirmations of this via XXXX XXXX texts. 

However, I quickly became suspicious when his story became inconsistent and immediately called another Wells Fargo number listed on the website and spoke with an agent to verify what had happened. I read the phone numbers that had texted me and called me directly to the agent ; she informed me these were legitimate Wells Fargo phone numbers, and that XXXXspecial ' agents like XXXX XXXX had their own way of resolving things, and it should be fine. 

When no money had appeared in my account by XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo again. They told there was no such thing as 'reverse ' transactions and had been sent outbound to XXXX XXXX Furthermore, they told me that legitimate Wells Fargo phone numbers were regularly spoofed, and that anyone could call from them. I filed a formal complaint with the bank to try to get the {$2000.00} XXXX transaction reversed and a short time later, this request was denied. On XX/XX/XXXX, I escalated this to a Wells Fargo consumer advocate, who filed a report with the executive office. I received confirmation of this filing. On the XXXX, the Executive Office responded, informing me that all XXXX transactions were irreversible, including those that were fraudulent and criminal, and it was my fault for failing to verify the recipient, despite the fact a bank employee had verified to me that this transaction was legitimate. 

Next, I attempted to file an official report with XXXX : XXXX required a 12 digit transaction ID to report a fraudulent transaction and their website informed me that "" I could acquire this number from my bank ''. I ended up speaking with multiple escalating levels of representative, only for them to tell me that there are no such things as 12 digit transaction IDs. In conclusion, Wells Fargo enabled scammers to steal {$2000.00} from me, and made reporting all-but impossible"
2335,"Someone scammed me of my money. The person who scammed me was pretending to be XXXX and sending me Emails stating if I didn't send {$350.00} to the "" XXXX agent '' I would not be able to receive the payment for the shoes they were going to purchase from me. They stated in order for me to receive the money I'd have to send {$350.00} to a XXXX agent and I would be able to receive the money, the {$350.00} back, and that my account would be upgraded to a business  one. Wells Fargo has done nothing to help me with my case and denied reimbursing the money I lost.

We have no idea how our Wells Fargo accounts were breached, why the bank did not inform us of suspicious activity in our accounts? What IP address was used by the criminals to access our accounts? No money transfers were ever initiated by us throughout our 15 year banking history with Wells Fargo., All of a sudden all our money is being transferred and the bank did nothing to alert us and no red flags were raised? 
No one at Wells Fargo has bothered to answer any of our questions, what investigation have they done for fraud? 
Why we didnt receive any warnings, emails or texts to alert us on the transactions in a timely manner? All we got from Wells Fargo is denial form letters with no signatures, we are confused and distraught and they are giving us a run around and treating us, their customers, in a very unfair and condescending manner. 
We are disputing and appealing the denial, we hope that Wells Fargo will do the right thing and investigate this fraud. Their own bankers have told us that wire fraud is an ongoing issue at the bank, why there was no cybersecurity services to proactively safeguard our accounts and improve our security posture. We trusted our bank to safeguard our money and they failed us."

I would like to add onto the two complaints as I keep getting letters forwarded from Wells Fargo that appear to be attempts to turn their lack of action on the fraudulent claims on my sister 's accounts into an excuse to deny proper claims payments and possibly do more unauthorized credit transfers. For example, I received the two attached letters on XX/XX/XXXX. One demands my sister call "" within 10 calendar days from the date of this letter, '' as they have been "" unable to reach you ''. This is totally false as I've been talking to various Wells Fargo reps for months now, as POA for my sister ( and even before then ), about the fraudulent charges on her XXXX/debit accounts. The letter was dated XX/XX/XXXX, with the demand to call within 10 calendar days, which would make the cut off date XX/XX/XXXX. The letter was postmarked after the cut off date, XX/XX/XXXX, and I received the forwarded mail on XX/XX/XXXX. They know my correct mailing address and manage to send her XXXX bill directly to me but somehow can not send these "" time sensitive '' letters properly. 

The XX/XX/XXXX letter threatened to reverse the inadequate provisional credit of {XXXX that has so far been put into her account if she did not respond by XX/XX/XXXX. The letter was postmarked XX/XX/XXXX and I received the forwarded mail on XX/XX/XXXX. I think they're playing perverse and ugly games with my sister 's finances. And by the way, I did call them again for the umpteenth zillion time the day I received the letters and it ended up where it always does -- much time spent on the phone, nothing at all accomplished or settled. They think they'll wear me down and I'll give up, but I won't. I'll keep documenting these revolting elder and financial abuses. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX I received a credit card statement for a new credit card ending in ... XXXX. It was actually sent to the correct address! Wells Fargo has opened a new credit card effective XX/XX/XXXX, replacing the old credit card ending in ... XXXX. I specifically advised Wells Fargo I did not want a new credit card authorized and we have not authenticated the new card. I told them I wanted to gain visibility into her old credit card and verify charges in order to set up a payment schedule. The current XXXX statement shows the XXXX} cash advance reversals as well as {$1400.00} in additional credit adjustments to her XXXX. These credits and adjustments to the new credit card, as well as an immediate demand for payment of {XXXX}, further penalize my sister 's ability to pay from a checking account that had {XXXX from the sale of her car removed without our approval. I know banks have fraud insurance and so far it doesn't appear that insurance has covered any of my sister 's losses. Wells Fargo should have seen the ongoing fraud with her accounts -- monthly payments to computer repair companies and car warranty companies ( {XXXX} in the most recent month for car warranties for a six year old car ), gift card scams, and many others. We certainly complained about it several times at the XXXX branch before she went to assisted living. Why was Wells Fargo not alerting their customer of this? My company alerts me about suspicious transactions that are much more benign than this XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Is Wells Fargo profiting off the financial fraud being perpetrated -- added fees, late payments, interest, etc. -- as well as fraud insurance claims? My sister seems to be paying for this fraud all on her own with little recompense from Wells Fargo or their insurance company. Something doesn't smell right. 


To recap : I have POA over XXXX XXXX XXXX accounts but have been denied visibility into her XXXX accounts where much of the fraud emanates, along with credit card cash transfers into her checking account and then debit transfers to criminals. 

The claims I am aware of today : WF Claim # XXXX, links to CFPB ID # XXXX WF Claim # XXXX, links to CFPB ID # XXXX XXXX -- no idea what this is ( dated XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX -- no idea what this is XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Case No. XXXX, used for an unauthorized transfer reversal of {XXXX} XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX. We were not notified nor aware of this transaction until we saw it on her bank account transactions. There is no record of the claim in my sister 's files or my files. I disputed the {XXXX} cash advance in phone calls and writing ( letters attached dated XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX ). Their claim that I disputed another {XXXX} cash advance sometime in the prior year is false. I've told them that many times by phone. 
WF XXXX # XXXX, {XXXX} temp credit. on claim ( which included, among others, another XXXX XXXX XXXX transaction of {XXXX} ) -- letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ( see above ) threatens to reverse the credit if the impossible doesn't happen -- no response by XX/XX/XXXX WF Claim # XXXX, XXXX} final credit ( all CXXXX XXXX XXXX transactions ) I continue to have no visibility into the XXXX "" claim ( s ) '' whatsoever. Their customer service continues to stonewall, with various means, my attempts to get information. A forwarded letter to my sister, dated XX/XX/XXXX, from Wells Fargo references an inquiry into her XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX, case # XXXX. I also have an email from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/XXXX, case # XXXX, referencing another inquiry into her XXXX. I have not seen these inquiries, I don't know what they are and my sister didn't make them. 

My sister expressed her wishes to Wells Fargo that I needed to have access to her XXXX account in order to monitor it. They have been ignored, as well as the legal power of attorney documents signed XX/XX/XXXX. 

I don't know of any other way to add onto the prior claims except by doing another one and referencing the prior claims. I'm sorry for any inconvenience. I'm concerned about Wells Fargo 's actions ( and non-actions ) and their blizzard of forwarded mailings that seem to be attempting to build a case to steal more money from my sister 's accounts. I'm alerting you to the fact that she is overdue a direct deposit tax refund and I don't want that to disappear like the {XXXX did. She can not afford that. 

Thank you for any help you can provide. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
2347,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a text from what I believed was the Wells Fargo fraud department. It asked me if I authorized XXXX charges, XXXX for {$1000.00} and another for {$700.00}. I replied no. I received another text from the "" fraud department '' saying they would contact me. This same process was actually used on XXXX different occasions approximately 15 years ago when my account information was obtained through an ATM and my account was used fraudulently. After speaking to the "" representative '' they had advised me I needed to send the money back from XXXX which is run by XXXX XXXX  back to myself. The {$1000.00} was intended to be sent back into my account, the transaction even says my name, but once the transaction was complete I was disconnected. The money was not intended for anyone other than myself. I went to bed that evening thinking nothing of it because after all I had believed it was Wells Fargo ; until the next morning. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo XXXX  department where they led me to believe I was getting my money back within 10 business days. On the XXXX day, XX/XX/XXXX,, I called to where they informed me the case was closed because the scammers bank refused to return the money. They had closed my claim without even informing me! To alot of people {$1000.00} isn't much, to me it is. I have XXXX children and I work hard to save any money. I was led to believe I was protected by Wells Fargo online fraud protection. According to Wells Farg, this is not the case because it was through XXXX which Wells Fargo partners with. Apparently, after much research, Wells Fargo has returned some consumers money but not others. Those individuals they have returned the money to have had to seek outside help such as news stations and online sources. Wells Fargo has not and is not treating this situation with fairness to the consumer. I would appreciate the return of the {$1000.00} that was taken from my account."
2348,"I only use my Wells Fargo account for paying bills, online shopping, online selling, and receiving my work checks so I really never look at my account like that since I have all my bills set up to pay from the account.. 

It started when I noticed emails saying some of my bills where not being paid.. then I tried to look at on the app and it wont let me in from XX/XX/2020 - XX/XX/2020 .. I try calling customer service to get in but due to coronavirus the wait times were very long so I went to my local branch. 

I finally get into my account and see that its in negative. I see 2 checks written and deposited in ATM for XXXX on XX/XX/2020 and XXXX on XX/XX/2020 ... frm XXXX XXXX NV.. I live in South Carolina.. I also never written a check in my life.. I also see cash app transactions for the amount of XXXX XX/XX/2020, XXXX XX/XX/2020, and XXXX XX/XX/2020 which I also didnt authorize.. 

I call Wells Fargo and file a claim and they tell me to wait 10 days. Meanwhile while this is happening my online sells and work checks are being direct deposited to my account meaning Im paying off the negative debt it left and I also I have no money to pay my bills due to it being negative ... during this time their was no way for me to switch my direct deposit to another card or account because my job was closed down due to coronavirus.. so Im basically paying a debt I didnt even do! 

Few days later I receive a letter saying they are going to close my account due to it being over drawn so call to check on the claim.. the Wells Fargo claims department told me thrs nothing they can do and since my account has been hacked they cant help me.. they tell me if I dont pay the collection agency will take over.. 
I go back to my local branch and tell them.. all they tell me to do is file a check deposit claim.. 
meanwhile my last few work checks have basically got the debt down and my account is XXXX now. I call to try and set up another claim and they said since the claim has been closed already they cant open another one! My bills are pass due cause of this.. they basically didnt even care.. please help.."
2349,"I did 2 wire transfers in XXXX dollars from XXXX XXXX in XXXX to Wells Fargo in XXXX XXXX where they converted the money to USD and sent it to my account in XXXX XXXX, TX. One was on XX/XX/XXXX for AUD XXXX, and the second was on XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX. Before doing so, I called XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX and got wiring instructions by email from XXXX XXXX of Wells Fargo. 
I also asked about the forex or exchange rate that would be used to convert the money. I explained that I was aware that it was a common practice, say in the case of tourists getting pocket money for a trip, to change the money at a rate of around 5 points less than the real, official exchange rate of the day. I said that I wanted to be sure that this would not happen as it would cost me several thousand dollars on the amount I would be transferring. She told me that I would not be shorted that way and that the bank would use the official, public exchange rate for the specific date and time. Just prior to the transfers, I called again with a couple more questions and repeated my concerns about the exchange rate that would be used. She told me the same thing. 
When Wells Fargo changed the money on the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, the published exchange rate on internet sites was about XXXX. My money converted at just short of XXXX, and I calculate that I received just over {$8000.00} less because of this difference. Prior to XX/XX/XXXX, I sent wires to XXXX in XXXX and also to XXXX, and they always used the official rate of the day. Even this summer, my daughter changed some XXXX dollars at the branch here in XXXX XXXX, and it appears that they used the day 's official rate. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I talked to XXXX with Wells Fargo again and XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX. He then explained that they only used that official, public exchange rate for very large transactions, like XXXX XXXX dollars. 
XXXX XXXX with my branch in XXXX XXXX also followed this up for me. It was agreed that the communication with me about the exchange rates fell short, but they made no offer to compensate me for some or all of the difference. 
I believe that they had to understand what I was asking, and I do not believe that the disclosure was complete and adequate. I understand that it is probably legal to give whatever exchange rate they want as long as they disclose how it is done. In this case they did not, and it seems that they should take responsibility for that. If I had had full and complete information, I may well have done things differently. I would have certainly talked to other banks, and I would maybe have tried to do the whole XXXX in one transaction ( from within my XXXX account, my daily transaction limit was XXXX ). As I've said, I feel Wells Fargo should be responsible for incomplete, inadequate disclosure and the money I may have lost due to this."

2367,"I received a text that my debit card was used for a {$500.00} purchase in XXXX Texas. shortly thereafter I received a call from Wells Fargo ( caller ID showed up on my phone because it is a known number to me ) asking me about the charge. I said it wasn't me, and they should not let it go through. then they said there were also several XXXX transfers going to someone named XXXX, did I do those? I said no, that wasn't me. 
After talking for several minutes, I said, this doesn't sound right, let me talk to your supervisor. He put someone else on the phone who identified himself as a Wells Fargo employee, giving me a first name and an ID number. He also said, "" XXXX XXXX, I am calling you from the number on the back of your card, you can check it '' It was the number on the back of my card. He then proceeded to tell me the XXXX transfer was currently "" pending '' and if I didn't do exactly as he directed, the money would be transferred. Keep in mind I was driving at the time, I had to pull over to continue my conversation. He had me add myself as a XXXX recipient, and he said if I sent myself the money, it would be put back into my account. I continued to question this whole thing, but he kept insisting if I don't do this, my money will be gone. I did it and my money was transferred out and didn't return. After I hung up I went directly to the bank and found out I had been scammed, there wasn't a fraud alert on my card, and the call was NOT from Wells Fargo, the number had been spoofed. I closed my account and opened new ones with different passwords, etc. I reported the incident to the real Wells Fargo Fraud division within two hours. While I was on hold for 35 mins I looked at my emails from Wells Fargo. During the 55 minutes I was on the phone, my phone number had been changed, the debit card had been changed, and the email had been changed in the XXXX portion of the Wells Fargo Mobile App. They switched the information while I was on the phone, so when I thought I was sending money back to myself from a fraudster, I was actually sending it to them in my name! I made them, at the insistence of someone I thought was a Wells Fargo employee, under fraudulent circumstances to someone who had hacked my account while I was on the phone. At no time did I give them any information, they already knew my debit card number, my phone number, and my email. It was a total of {$2300.00}. I reported this to the FBI online fraud division that same day, XX/XX/2021. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a response, "" We have determined the transactions were made by you, or someone who had your authorization ''. I refused to accept this outcome, so I brought it to the escalation department, not once, but twice. I sent them proof of the phone number change within my account, which was not authorized by me. Since I was defrauded out of my money, this is a Regulation E matter and I should get my money returned by the bank. 
Here is a portion of their final reply "" Electronic Funds Transfer Act ( Regulation E ) We are committed to protecting the security of our customers accounts and periodically need to take certain actions to detect and prevent fraud. Based on the information available in this situation, we feel our actions were appropriate and necessary to avoid potential risk. 

What you need to know XXXX Transfers process transactions based on token information provided when the transaction is initiated and it is validated after the transfer is sent to the appropriate recipient. It is vital for the intended recipient to verify the accuracy of token information to ensure they receive the funds requested. We do apologize ; however, as the transaction processed correctly, we are unable to honor your claim. '' It processed correctly because fraudsters hacked my account and changed the information while I was on the phone!

They then proceeded to explain I needed to go into my mobile banking and sign on to XXXX, create myself as a recipient and give them the code, so they can receive the money being pulled out and send it back to me. I asked why they could not just stop the transaction, and was advised because XXXX is a third party app, they were not able to do so. Therefore I proceeded to comply thinking I would just stop the money from being fraudulently taken from my account. Once the transaction was completed, they hung up on me. It was not until after, that I realized they swapped one number out from Wells Fargos XXXX number ( XXXX ). I immediately called my bank an filed a fraud claim and asked if they could stop the transaction and refund my money.

While waiting on hold, I received a phone call from XXXX ( which appeared to be Wells Fargo ). The person identified himself as XXXX XXXX from Wells Fargo and stated he would assist me in blocking the transmission of {$3500.00} from being sent. He said he would walk me through step by step. He also, stated he would place a Manager on the phone by the name of XXXX XXXX to validate the transaction. XXXX proceeded to send me a text message from XXXX issuing me a code to identify that this call was legitimate. Once I received the text he said that I would need to create a XXXX recipient account to myself using my cell phone number. I did as he instructed. I sent in two separate transactions one for {$1000.00} and another for {$2500.00} to myself XXXX XXXX using my cell phone number. When the transaction on my end was complete we were disconnected. I waited approximately for 1 minute for a return call that never happened. I immediately realized it was fraud and called Wells Fargo to block the transmission of the funds. Wells Fargo stated there was nothing they could do at this time. While speaking with the funds were transferred out of my account. We immediately began to shut down all of my Wells Fargo accounts, I filed a claim ( claim # XXXX ) and was transferred to the Fraud Department. Approximately 10 business days after the occurrence I was provided a provisional credit. On, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, which stated the investigation has been concluded. It was determined that this was a SCAM and the provisional credit ( s ) will be debited from my account on XX/XX/XXXX. I called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with a XXXX XXXX I wanted to know why the provisional credit ( s ) were going to be reversed. He stated Wells Fargo does not cover products or services. I did not purchase any service or product under false pretences. This was not a SCAM this was Fraud. I told XXXX that what happened to me was covered under Regulation E, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and could be found in the EFTA amended FAQ 's dated XX/XX/XXXX item # 5. He then said that he would have to escalate the issue and someone would get back to me within 48 hours. Of course, that never happened. On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out again and got the runarounds, I spoke with several people, created a case ( case # XXXX ) with the XXXX Team with another promise to be contacted within 7-10 days. I do not have the liberty of that timeframe because the money will be reversed on XX/XX/XXXX. Not at any point did Wells Fargo ask for supporting documentation, text messages or screenshots. They did not extend the investigation period do to lack of information. So, I am confused as to how the investigation was concluded. I have also filed a complaint and provided all details of my experience with the XXXX. I just want the money provided as a provisional credit to stand."

The representative XXXX wrote down my phone number and said he will call me back for an appointment. I am upset because the representative XXXX didnt take the matter urgently. He didnt seem to care or concern that XXXX may be withdrawn by the recipient. He said he will call me back to schedule an appointment and we will handle it.

Instead, he reach out to representative XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to help me with the matter since I have an appointment. Although international wire transfer takes up to 3 business days to complete, I believe there was still a chance to stop the swift recall. Instead, the recall was initiated on the day I made an appointment on XXXX, XXXX. The swift recall could have initiated 24 hours sooner. Because such a large amount of money was wired out, XXXX, the representative XXXX should have take the matter seriously especially knowingly that was a scam wired transfer.

2390,"Unauthorized XXXX payments were taken out of my Wells Fargo account on XXXX XXXX, 2021. Both transactions were in the amount of {$900.00} each. I submitted a claim with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. During that phone conversation, a specialist closed my account and opened a new bank account. After XXXX business days, we called Wells Fargo for a status update and the specialist informed us the claim was mistakenly filed under someone else 's name ( no relation to me or the other account holder ). I had to file another claim on XX/XX/XXXX21 and was informed it would take another XXXX business days for resolution. This is after several phone conversations with several fraud specialists at Wells Fargo resulting in hours of on-hold time and hours of conversations with several difference fraud specialists. We were just informed today that WF has denied the claim. 
XXXX is the bank 's money app that I never use. I did not authorize those transactions."
2391,I need to know where my income tax went
2392,"Commencing on or about XX/XX/2019, I fell victim to a multilayered scam operation orchestrated by XXXX XXXX ( the Company ), with the design, development, manufacture, promoting, marketing, distribution, labelling, and/or sale of illegal and outright fraudulent investment services, '' all of which aim at contributing to the goal of robbing and defrauding clients, through a predetermined cycle of client losses to gains. Money was transferred from my account via bank wire in the total amount of XXXX XXXX USD utilizing Wells Fargo services."
2394,"I was ripped off from XXXX ; then found out that they hot wired my car and it could have caught on fire. 
Owner never went over the invoice and charged my card {$2100.00} ; charged me for a warranty that was never given. 
I called Wells Fargo and disputed the amount ; they only allowed provisional credit of {$1100.00} Wells Fargo sent letters in which I took care of I spoke to XXXX on XXXX and he said they needed another opinion in which I provided to them by email this morning Wells Fargo removed the credit and per XXXX, employed by Wells Fargo in the XXXX said my claim was closed XX/XX/2021 even though I had been in contact daily I not only had problems with XXXX but with Wells Fargo"
2395,I called Wells Fargo to exchange my dollars for yuan. When I called the XXXX XXXX  number the phone agent gave me an exchange rate of .XXXX dollars to XXXX yuan. When I went to my local Wells Fargo branch they gave me XXXX dollars to XXXX  yuan. So I received about 8 percent less money than I should have and their records on the transaction show their rate and not the rate I agreed upon over the phone. I need help getting the money I agreed upon or giving the money back at full rate.
2396,"After shopping for a miniature dachshund online at XXXX I emailed the seller regarding a specific dachshund for purchase in the amount of {$500.00}. At this point, the correspondence was email and/or texting. After the seller supposedly dropped off the puppy for a vet clearance, a pet carrier had possession of the puppy for transport via a coupon provided by the seller for a flight. The pet carrier then contacted me for {$800.00} for pet insurance. Unfortunately, at this point, I realized this was a scam. I contacted the seller, XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX and he said that 98 % would be refunded to me of this insurance. I declined payment of this {$800.00}. He also said he couldn't return my {$500.00} because he didn't have it. I immediately contacted Wells Fargo Bank as the wire transfer was made through them and XXXX. I filed a complaint with them but they declined the claim as they stated I authorized the transfer. XXXX stated that I needed to go through my bank for assistance. Neither was helpful. Wells Fargo should have been able to reverse the wire transfer with XXXX knowing that this was fraud. They didn't. I also filed an Internet Crime Complaint and a complaint with the FTC."
2397,"Hello Wells Fargo, I am writing you this email because I would like to reopen a claim that your team denied. I was told that I could email your claim assistance team here to get it reopened and continue the investigation. In this email I will present sufficient evidence in PDF format of why this claim needs to be reopened, a retelling of what happened, and why this is so unfair and unacceptable as a customer. 

On the XXXX of XXXX, I sent {$200.00} dollars to XXXX through XXXX for an artwork that I bought from him. On XX/XX/XXXX, he blocked me and I never received the merchandise. I never received what I paid for. I got scammed. 

The evidence of where he received the payment will be titled as 'confirmation that he received the payment ' PDF. In this PDF, he is confirming that he received the money. I did authorize the transaction, but I should not be denied only because I was the one who authorized it. This claim needs to be reopened and the evidence that will be sent here needs to be applied to the situation. I was taken advantage of and scammed. Wells Fargo needs to side with the customer and not the scammer. 

The evidence of our last conversation is in the second PDF attached that is titled : 'end of conversation photo '. In this PDF, he leaves me on read on XX/XX/XXXX and blocks me by XX/XX/XXXX. That is where he blocked me. There are timestamps to show proof of when each message was sent. On the XXXX, I immediately filed a claim with Wells Fargo once I realized that he blocked me and that I was scammed. 

The evidence of him blocking me can be seen in the third PDF titled : 'blocked image 1 '. In this image, you can see that his profile is no longer available. I no longer follow him and none of his information pops up. This is evident proof of him blocking me and he reveals that he scammed me. If he was a real seller, I would have received my artwork and he never would have blocked me. He would keep in contact with me. As seen in the PDF titled : 'end of conversation photo ', I asked him at XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX, "" oh nice! can i see? "". If he intended to actually sell me a real artwork, he would have followed up by sending me a photo of the art piece. However, the following day I was blocked. 

After patiently waiting 10 business days for my claim to be investigated, I received a notification stating it was completed on XX/XX/XXXX. I called a claim representative and they stated that it was denied. They described to me why it was denied. They only told me that I could go to XXXX and discuss it with them. I talked with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and they denied helping me as well. This is because this type of payment is not covered by "" XXXX Buyers Protection Program ''. They told me that I have to talk with my bank or card issuer and that it only can be resolved through Wells Fargo. They stated that Wells Fargo can contact them to receive additional information about the transaction. 

The type of transaction that I sent the money with is under "" Family and Friends. '' XXXX does not do refunds for these types of payments. However, I researched and found numerous individuals that posted online about receiving refunds from Wells Fargo even when they were the ones who sent the funds to the recipient through "" Family and Friends '' on XXXX. Wells Fargo did not deny them. Wells Fargo sided with them. The evidence of him tricking me into sending it on "" Family and Friends '' instead of "" Business '' can be seen in the fourth PDF titled : 'tricking me proof '. If he were an honest seller, he would NOT have done this. He would have done it through 'Business ' so I could refund it if I was not happy with the artwork or if it came damaged. Instead, he tricked me and scammed me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX when I was speaking to the claim assistant, they told me I could also contact the recipient and work it out with them. This is NOT possible. I contacted him a second time on XX/XX/XXXX and he blocked me again. The evidence of my messages to him can be seen in the PDF titled : 'trying to contact him. ' In this chat, I am aggressive because he is a scammer and he stole my money. If he were a real artist, he would have not blocked me for a second time. He would have responded and tried to resolve the matter at hand, even if I was aggressive. If he was a real seller, he would not care if I was aggressive and he would have responded so he could help me to the best of his ability. He did not block me because of my aggressiveness. However, he responded by blocking me again. The evidence of him blocking me a second time can be seen in the PDF titled : 'blocked image 2 '. Again, the profile is mostly gone and it says that this is 'User not found '. In the end, it is impossible to contact him and if I tried to do it again, he would keep blocking me. Do NOT ask me to contact him again. 

The denial of my claim is unacceptable and unfair. It is truly disappointing that I, as a Wells Fargo customer, was denied and the bank that I should be able to trust has sided with a scammer. It should NOT MATTER if I authorized this transaction or not and if I did this with a third party app. I have done EVERYTHING that was asked of me : contacting XXXX about helping me, contacting the recipient, and filing a claim. Only Wells Fargo can help, XXXX can not and they told me to ask my bank for help. It is Wells Fargo 's JOB to protect their customers and to side with them when it is right. I was NOT taken seriously and I am incredibly frustrated, angry, and ashamed that my bank would do this to me. There is sufficient evidence presented in this email of why I deserve to be refunded. There is evidence online of customers being refunded in the same situations as I am in right now. I was blocked and I never received my merchandise. As a customer, I have the RIGHT to ask for my claim to be reopened. NO ONE should have to go through this.

I kindly ask you to reopen this claim and help one of your loyal, long-term customers by refunding the payment of {$200.00} to the RIGHTFUL owner. No customer should have to experience this horrible treatment and no scammer should have money that is taken from victims of fraud. I never received what I bought and I deserve to be reimbursed. Please reconsider your decision, thank you. 

Lastly, I would like to file a chargeback if possible. The recipient does NOT have a merchant ID, but I do have their email for Wells Fargo and XXXX. Please respond in a timely manner to stay in touch. Thank you."
2399,"On XX/XX/2015 Wells Fargo accepted a bond for {>= $1,000,000} from the XXXX Family Trust. On XX/XX/2015 XXXX XXXX sent an email stating that the inquiry has been logged into the queue with the receipt number XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ). I was never able to access the funds because Wells Fargo Stole the bond and closed my account. Fraud has not statue of limitation."
2400,"WELLS FARGO BANK Fraud Case XXXX On Tuesday, XX/XX/2021 I became a victim of wire transfer fraud when I responded to an email that appeared to be from XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX. 

My wife and I are in the process of purchasing a home in XXXX, Washington and the wire transfer was intended for the down payment and closing funds for this purchase. 

A wire transfer in the amount of {$33000.00} was sent to Wells Fargo Bank on XX/XX/2021. The account was allegedly in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX and was sent from my bank account with XXXX Bank. 

On the same day the wire transfer was sent to Wells Fargo I learned I had been spoofed by a fraudulent email request and a wire recall request was placed by my bank to Wells Fargo. 

Wells Fargo Bank requested a Letter of Indemnity from XXXX Bank in response to the wire transfer recall. 

After filing a complaint with CFPB due to XXXX Banks lack of timely action and follow through on this matter, XXXX Bank responded to Wells Fargo Banks request on Tuesday, XX/XX/2021. 

The Wells Fargo Bank fraud department has confirmed their wire department is in receipt of the paperwork from XXXX Bank. The paperwork is under review by Wells Fargo Bank. 

Wells Fargo Bank has acknowledged they are holding the wire transfer funds pending response from XXXX Bank. 

During the course of communications with XXXX Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, all parties were made aware of the time sensitive nature of the matter and that prompt action was needed to not only ensure return of the wire transfer funds, but to also prevent losing our ability to purchase the home of our dreams and suffering additional financial loss by losing our earnest money deposit. 

I am submitting this in hopes of expediting the process of getting my wire transfer funds promptly returned so that I may finalize the purchase of our new home."
2401,I live is XXXX XXXX texas on XX/XX/XXXX I made a transfer through wells fargo transfer that never reached the beneficiary that was XXXX in XXXX I have tried through my bank but without success I have not been able to recover the money back could someone contact me the XXXX / XXXX  is XXXX. My phone number is. XXXX XXXX. If there is a customer service line or someone who can contact me please. I have month 's trying to get a solution and today the bank manager tell me I have to contact the other bank the have the funds sounds like a joke.
2402,"Please note that this complaint is against Wells Fargo : On XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to transfer {$1500.00} from my Wells Fargo account to my XXXX XXXX XXXX account. I tried to use my debit card on the latter bank on XX/XX/XXXX and it was declined. I checked my account and the transaction had been reversed somehow. This caused me to have a negative balance. So, instead of moving money from the Former bank account the transfer came from the bank that was supposed to originally receive the money. I have transferred money before and never had this problem. 
I called Wells Fargo to make sure that they cancelled the transaction in hopes that this would reverse the transaction and the money would not be accepted from XXXX XXXX XXXX. According to the agent I spoke with, the cancelled the transaction. 
Fast forward to the XXXX and I am not showing the transfer in the Wells Fargo account but I am still showing a negative balance in the bank account that was supposed to originally receive the transfer. 
I have called both banks numerous times. Wells Fargo has no documentation of a transfer or a deposit of funds from the latter bank. The other bank declares that Wells Fargo received the money. 
Please note the attached screenshot that is the only evidence that is obtainable. It shows the wrong transfer from the latter institution to the original bank that was supposed to transfer the funds. 
It is very disappointing, today, in 2021 a bank does not have the capacity to keep up with its transactions and mysteriously I have no record of any of the events that have occurred in the past 9 days."

Please help. Initially received text then the bank called took my money via XXXX. Attaching phone ling bank taking money bank and XXXX transaction IDs
2404,Ongoing dispute of a bank to bank transfer. Initiated transfer XX/XX/2021. XXXX Wells Fargo branch XX/XX/2021. Opened claim with Wells Fargo XX/XX/2021. XXXX with Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX representatives on XX/XX/2021. Was provided trace information from both parties.
2406,"On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I made an offer to purchase my first home. With the offer I wrote an EMD check to put toward the house. On XXXX XXXX, someone attempted to forge a check with my exact signature as the EMD check that I wrote for the house and had the next check number as the previously written check. 
In the first week of XXXX XXXX, I began to receive emails from the title company I was supposed to close with. I questioned this person and called the number that was given at the bottom of the signature to make sure this was in-fact a person that worked there. The company confirmed that she did and I proceeded to communicate with her. She continued to email me about the closing through out the month leading up to the closing date. I was supposed to wire my money XXXX XXXX, but I did not receive a final number yet, but I did receive a wire transfer form from my realtor. The next day, on XXXX XXXX, I received a wire transfer form from the fake person that was pretending to be the title company. I did not know at the time that she was not who she said she was. I looked at the form she sent, and the form my realtor sent the day before, and they were identical, except the account and routing numbers were changed. I questioned this with the realtor 's email address that was CC 'd on the email, which this address was also fake, and that person reassured me that everything was correct. That afternoon I wired the money to the account that I thought belonged to the closing title company. The morning I was supposed to close, XXXX XXXX, the fake person emailed me stating the closing had to be postponed, and she knew what time my closing was. During the closing process, it became known that the money was in-fact not wired to the correct account, and was wired to a fake account. I quickly called the credit union that wired the money to to a wire transfer recall. They were able to recall half of my wired money. I initially wired {$40000.00} to the fake account, which was at Wells Fargo bank ( they did nothing to assist me in getting my money back or freezing the account. I am not even able to find out if they have an investigation into this fraudulent activity ). The credit union was able to retrieve {$20000.00}. That same say, I filed a police report with the city that I reside in, to possible get resolution to this matter. I have also been in contact with an attorney and she believes that this is an inside job at either the sellers or buyers realtor company ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX respectively )."
2409,"On XX/XX/XXXX we accessed our account online at Wells Fargo Bank and discovered that fraudulent transactions were paid against our account using ACH debits on XX/XX/XXXX in the amounts of {$3500.00} & {$3700.00} ( ref # XXXX ). I telephoned Wells Fargos customer service to report the fraud and recover the funds. During that call I was asked to complete a verbal affidavit and was informed the bank would investigate and if the issues were not resolved within 10 days a provisional credit would be provided. No credit has been provided as of the date of this complaint. I also asked the bank to place an ACH block on the account to prevent any further fraudulent transactions. Instead, the representative, told me that they would put a stop-payment in place that would block any further loss from these vendors, I discovered they only placed the stop payment on the {$3500.00}. As I investigated further, I discovered that the ACH debit for {$3700.00}, had been paid twice, the first time on XX/XX/XXXX, of which I informed the bank. In the days that followed I began to receive contradictory notices from the bank. 
On XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter from the bank stating that the stop payment request failed because it was not reported in time enough for the bank to reverse the debit, ( it was reported the first business day after it was posted to the account ). This contradicted the notice which states fraudulent items need to be reported by the second business day, ( it posted on XX/XX/XXXX ). Furthermore, no action was taken on our request to place an ACH block on the account. On the same day we received a notice stating that the bank was not able to reimburse us because too much time had passed before we notified the bank of the fraudulent transactions ; the charges were posted on the night of XX/XX/XXXX and we notified the bank the morning of XX/XX/XXXX the next business day, and in fact the notice stated that we needed to report it the second business day, which suggest to us that no research was done and the bank dismissed our request outside of the guidelines of ACH regulations, reflected in the notice itself. 
On XX/XX/XXXX we reviewed our account and there were three additional fraudulent ACH debits charged against our account, in the amount of {$2400.00}, {$2700.00} & {$2200.00}, none of which would have been paid had the ACH block been enforce. We received additional notices on XX/XX/XXXX, that stated the bank had completed their research and determined that the 2 ACH debits of ( {$3700.00} ) totaling {$7500.00} were authorized and the case was considered closed. In the banks note, they stated that these ACH payment types, does not allow the bank to reverse authorization after the payment had been made. Once again representatives from the bank made statements that were not factual and denied us recovery of the funds that were stolen from our company. Even after having provided an affidavit that they were fraudulent & not authorized by our company or initiated by our clients the bank continued to imply we and our clients were complicit in the thief of funds from our account. When we asked how it was determined that these were authorized ; no documentary evidence was provided. By this time, our account was defrauded {$1800.00}. When we had no success with the normal fraud reporting process, we insisted that our case be escalated to the executive customer advocacy group. 
To our great disappointment the escalation to the executive advocacy group proved to be equally ineffective and served only to prolong our exposure to fraud at a bank that has no concept of customer advocacy. During this process we were bounced around to several representatives all of whom said the operating departments should have been able to resolve our issue. The representation that they would review the pattern & practice of our account and the recorded conversations throughout this process. The result of their review generated a letter on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX, simply restating the erroneous conclusion of prior notice. A further illustration of the poor work quality of the advocacy groups is the letter on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX, stating In your inquiry, you stated that your deposit account was closed with excessive overdrafts fees. We certainly understand your frustration regarding the concerns you referenced in your complaint. At Wells Fargo, we pride ourselves on developing and maintaining quality financial relationships. We apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced. While we are aware this does not alleviate any frustration, your comments are truly appreciated, as they are critical to our continued growth and improvement. We are responding to your recent complaint dated XX/XX/XXXX. We have determined we previously addressed your concerns and did not find you enclosed any new information or provided significantly different details that would change our response. We addressed your previous inquiry and are enclosing our previous response dated XX/XX/XXXX. We have reviewed your account activity since our prior response and our decision remains the same. The problem with this response is that it has nothing to do with ACH fraud, our account was never closed, we had no O/D fees & reference # XXXX has no connection to our Claim. Other than the name and address all the information in this letter was incorrect. 
When we further escalated our concerns within the advocacy group and spoke with XXXX XXXX, the Complaints/EO Manager, she expressed concern about our prolonged dispute and asked us to allow her time to review tapes, notices and discuss the issues with her associates. She also represented that there was an alternative source that the bank could use to make us whole by reimbursing our {$18000.00}. A week later we followed up at which point she requested that we wait 10 days until after her vacation, at which point she would leverage this alternative source of reimbursement. After that time elapsed, she never called us back, so we pursued XXXX XXXX exchanging a series of emails and phone calls which comprised of our challenging their erroneous conclusions & failure to operate within the uniform commercial code governing commercial ACH transactions. Her contention surmounted in her implying we were complicit in the fraud, based on her communications with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the company that received the funds from our account with whom we had no relationship. XXXX XXXX told us that XXXX provided a letter saying that we authorized them to create these transactions, which we assured her that we did not. She then forwarded a letter she received from XXXX. Which was ironic because we were receiving emails from XXXX inquiring about possible fraudulent ACH payments against our account and a fraudulent XXXX card in our company name that their fraud department were investigating. Therefore, the company XXXX XXXX was relaying on to dismiss our claims was simultaneously creating and investigating the fraudulent transactions in question. I have attached the email exchanges that illustrate the events. 
After we expressed our objection to the implication, we were complicit in the fraud to our account, another Wells Fargo associate sent a secure email informing us he would be our new point of contact however, he has never returned a phone call or email. 
We also know that no one reviewed the patterns and practices of our account, because if they had, they would know that we employ their secured direct payment service to make ongoing payments. Furthermore, two of the vendors names used in the fraud are registered on that system and have an audit trail of the dollar value & depository banks the funds would be directed. And the only other form of payments we use is our debit cards. It is an industry standard when conducting fraud investigations that the investigator reviews the patterns and practices of the account owner to discover abnormalities of transactions. The abnormal nature of these were apparent and the adherence to UCC ACH guidance was not correctly followed or applied. We have also submitted a police report on XX/XX/XXXX # XXXX. 
As a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the way our claim was handled is one of the worst cases of customer service I have experienced. I retired from XXXX as a XXXX XXXX XXXX, during that time I spend 15 years as a XXXX in operations and cash management which affords me a depth of knowledge of how this fraud claim investigation should have been managed."
2411,"Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from a "" so called '' Wells Fargo customer service representative to inform me that they ( Wells Fargo ) had discovered Fraudulent activity on my account. The phone number was the same as the customer service number on the back of my debit card, XXXX. He assured me that this was a pressing issue that needed to be handled immediately. Unfortunately this was a scam call of someone pretending to be a Wells Fargo banker, had access to my information and even had the SAME phone number as WF customer service. 

There had been 2 charges on my statement that were made in Texas that were both over {$250.00}. Another, third charge, for an "" attempted wire transfer '' for {$6700.00} attempted. The ( WF caller ) convinced me that "" we '' need to open a new checking account to safely transfer my balance to make sure that WF could shut down the account and prevent future fraud activity on it so your money is safe. 

They sent me a one time CODE for the Wire Transfer, I am not sure how they even got my info or the CODE. 

The next day when there was not a new account on my profile and all my money {$6700.00} was gone. I knew then that the man on the line from the day before was the one who scammed me. I felt completely violated. 

I would and will never knowingly approve and initiate a wire transfer to a random bank account that I have never done any business or transfers with in a completely different state. I was under the impression that I was speaking with WELLS FARGO. I had no reason not to believe them based on the number and the amount of information they had. 

I immediately called Wells Fargo that morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to see if they could stop the wire transfer since I know most transfers are held for XXXX days for things just like this. The fraud department put me on hold for XXXX hours and said they would open a case and get back to me in 10 days. 

I insisted that time was of great importance so that they could contact the bank where the money was sent before the perpetrator could withdrawal the funds. 

Wells Fargo customer service did not help at all. I went into the branch ( XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ) to talk to the banker and he said there was nothing he could do and I would have to wait the 10 days ( fraud processing protocol ). I knew by the time they got to my case, there would be no way to keep the money from being withdrawn. 

The Wells Fargo customer service was awful. I called 8 times over the course 10 days ( XXXX ) to push my case along and get information. I was on hold for over 8 hours total. They did not want to help me and XXXX banker even told me "" Its not our problem you can scammed '' and hung up on me. So now not only had I been scammed and lost my money but the banker is shaming me and won't help. I started to think "" was this an inside job? '' It was conveniently pushed under the rug and no one contacted me until XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX PM ( 15 days after the initial incident and 14 days from when I notified them of the problem and freeze the transfer ) when the WF "" fraud specialist '' said that I would NOT be getting my {$6700.00} back because they had NO Way to track where it went or who did it.. 

I said "" that if your bank institution can't be trusted to protect my money, what's going to keep it from happening again? And if it just keeps happening and Wells Fargo never fixes or finds the issue then that is an uncompetitive system and they should not be allowed to do business at all. '' She said she is "" sorry but she can't do anything '' since they already withdraw the funds and I was the one who sent the wire. I told her that contact the bank within 24 hours and they did nothing. It took over 2 weeks to get a call back. 


I still don't understand how they approved this transfer so quickly when I immediately notified the bank within less than 24 hours. I still don't understand how they hacked my account in the first place and could cause transactions in Texas to show up. Lastly. I have no idea how they could send me the codes for the transfer and WF still not know or track that. 

I am not a banker. I trust the bank to keep my money and information safe and they did not. Then after the fact they were disrespectful and shameful. It was the worst experience I've ever had with any bank and once this case is closed I will NEVER do business with WELLS FARGO again. 

Please help me resolve this issue."
2413,"On XX/XX/2021 I was traveling in XXXX, at the XXXX XXXX, and received texts and calls from Wells Fargo ( XXXX ) from XXXX saying my card had been used at XXXX and XXXX in Florida and that XXXX transfers had been made to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
No personal information was asked of me. They said the call was being recorded, my card would be reissued, my online banking would be inactivated and that I would need to call to get it re-activated and that a claim would be filed with authorities. 
I was told that the XXXX transfers went through, and I could see I received text messages about that, and they would walk me through requesting the funds back. I was told to add myself as a recipient to the XXXX portion of the Wells Fargo app and request the funds back. 
I did this. Obviously very wrong of me to do it without taking a minute to think or check my account or verify the caller. They didnt ask for anything personal from me so I didnt think anything of it. I had had fraud on my account before and it didnt seem any different, except for the XXXX part but since I was adding myself, I didnt think it was an issue at first. 
Then when I got home and saw that the funds went out of my account, at total of {$4000.00}! I realized I had been duped and actually sent money somehow even though I was the one that was added. I dont understand how the fraudsters work but I realized I had let them in somehow. 
I called Wells Fargo, the number being one digit off from the number that called me, and reported the fraud. They denied my claim since I had been a part to it. 
I am looking for some recourse even though I know I dont have much information to go on. I was sick and deleted some of the texts. The first one was from XXXX and said Wells Fargo Bank : Did You Attempt to Use Your Card for {$860.00} at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX Today, Reply YES or NO."
2414,"I recently became a victim of a fraudulent scheme and already filed a dispute claim on my bank account "" Wells Fargo '' but my dispute claim got denied. So I called the claims department and asked if there's any other option or how they can help me as it is a big amount of money that my family needs to get back. So they transferred my claim to the "" High Dollar Fraud Department '' and the representative that I spoke to confirmed that the claim has been denied again ( XX/XX/2021 ). The representative then just advice me to file a police report as they can't do anything anymore. 

I already finished submitting a a file complaint to FTC and FBI 's XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I have all the evidence that I was in fact a victim of fraudulent scheme and I can send everything if needed. 

I'm begging that you help me and my family get our hard earned money back."
2415,"THE FACTS The XXXX XXXX  was established in XXXX, its object being the import, export, manufacture, process, completion and marketing, wholesale and / or retail, of plastic products, such as bags, envelopes, packaging, among others ; manufacture, elaborate, buy, import, distribute, commercialize, on commission or not, sell, export and in general, dispose of all kinds of goods or products related to the plastic sector, as well as accessories, machinery, spare parts and supplies for its production. 
In this context, it is that at the end of XXXX and the beginning of XXXX, the company had contact with the representative in XXXX of the XXXX XXXX company XXXX XXXX XXXX, Mr. XXXX XXXX, a supplier company in the plastic sector. 
In these negotiations, the sale of raw material was agreed, in price, quantities, forms of payment, etc. In this context, through the email XXXX, they were sent the contract Sales Contract XXXX XXXX for US {$130000.00}, with respect to which US {$26000.00} was paid through XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to the following checking account XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX  from the United States, XXXX : XXXX. 
Regarding said amount of US {$26000.00}, XXXX 's representative in XXXX confirmed its receipt. 
Given the success of the negotiations, a new contract was reached "" Sales Contract XXXX XXXX '' for US {$100000.00}, which was sent through the email XXXX, which indicated a new account to carry out the payment, namely Wells Fargo Bank, XXXX # XXXX : XXXX. 
Said payment was also made through XXXX XXXX  XXXX, transferring US {$20000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, noting that there was an error in the account numbers, a matter reported through the same email XXXX Therefore, this indication was reiterated on XX/XX/XXXX, under reference XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, under reference XXXX, a transfer was made through the XXXX  XXXX XXXX to the company XXXX XXXX XXXX For US {$50000.00}, in accordance with the provisions of the contract Sales Contract No. XXXX to the account reported through the email emanated by XXXX, however, Mr. XXXX XXXX, informed XXXX that they had not received any payment, so the background was reviewed, which was consistent in relation to what was previously reported, commenting that perhaps that could be addressed as a result of the change of current account to Wells Fargo Bank. 
XXXX was the surprise when Mr. XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX, informed us that they did not have a checking account in said bank, so he went to the offices of XXXX, who, when reviewing the situation with the general manager and the partners, warned that the XXXX email account had been "" hacked '' and that there would be no responsibility in the emails that reported the change in the checking account. At his turn, he told them that this had already happened with another client for a defrauded amount of US {$180000.00}. 
In this context, it is that he contacted the parent company in the United States of America, who indicated that there would be no responsibility on their part, under the same arguments indicated by the XXXX subsidiary. However, they informed the XXXX XXXX  in the United States of America of the facts, generating a fraud alert between said institution and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, in charge of transferring the payments made by XXXX. 
Thus, on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX, reporting what happened and requesting the management of the return of the defrauded funds, however, the response was not satisfactory, all the time, Wells Fargo bank had made the payment to the account that was ordered, by virtue of the indications received, so to restore the amounts, a guarantee had to be subscribed for the eventual legal expenses by virtue of the procedures for the recovery of the money defrauded. Despite this, XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX indicated that it was not in a position to assume said guarantee, therefore the amounts would not be returned."
2416,"XX/XX/2021 {$350.00} was sent from my banking app via Wells Fargo to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for a service animal. I am on XXXX XXXX and need the support of an animal during my daily life. As soon as XXXX confirmed the amount was deposited she refused to provide me with the animal aka what I had paid for. My bank is stating that it is not responsible for the fraudulant transaction and to contact XXXX and XXXX is not responding to my note sent via email. This is through my banking app but not protected by my bank of 14 years?!? This lack of attention is a HUGE concern! 
XXXX XXXX XXXX Thank you for helping me during this uncertain and fragile time we are going through."
2418,"On  XXXX / XXXX /   2017  I initiated a transfer of {$500.00} from  my Wells Fargo ac count using the SurePay system to my cousin who uses   XXXX    XXXX   XXXX . It generated a reference number #  XXXX  and my cousin also got a text message on her phone indicating that the funds were received. However, when she checked her account, the funds were not there. She immediately called  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  to inquire, but they told her I 'd have to submit a claim through my bank because they saw no record of the funds.     Since then, I have submitted two claims wit h Wells Fargo (  Claim #  XXXX  &  XXXX   ).   Wells Fargo has closed both claims, stating that the funds were posted to an account but can not rele ase any additional information. My cousin has tried to inquire with   XXXX    XXXX   XXXX  but they refuse to provide any in  formation either.
Wells Fargo h  as told me that it 's possible  I may have  entered the incorrect phone number when I initiated the transfer. However, she got a text message indicating the transfer took place.     After opening up a claim by phone, which got rejected, I decided to send a complaint to  Wells Fargo through my online banking but this was the response I got : "" ... The claim is closed beca use the transfer was sent as requested. '' The response we 're getting from both banks suggests I 'll have to absorb a loss of {$500.00} and no one can help me. I 'm very disappointed in my bank for not even attempting to help me recoup the funds."
2419,"On XX/XX/2021 i was notified by a text message that there were several transactions made on my card & withdrawals, later i got a call from a worker from Wells Fargo letting my know that my card was being charge in XXXX Texas & i let him know i was in XXXX at the time i was NOT out of state. Then he read a couple transactions saying that i had 4 withdrawals from an ATM from somewhere in california made with a XXXX XXXX phone, again i let him know it was not me. First withdraw was {$100.00} second one from the same ATM was {$380.00} then again for {$320.00} & lastly {$200.00}. All late, he removed my card from the persons XXXX XXXX & change the pin apparently. i later had to call again & ask if i was going to get a new card but i guess the person didnt file that so i had to wait & do that again. I let him know i had called earlier because of unauthorized transactions & he said i should file a claim & so i did & i waited almost 2 weeks ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to find out i wasnt going to get my money back because my card was in my possession."
2421,"Hi there my name is XXXX XXXX.

2427,"Money of {$2000.00} was transferred to wrong XXXX account on XX/XX/2021 from Wells Fargo. After numerous calls between Wells Fargo ( sending company ) and XXXX ( receiving company ), Wells Fargo will not retrieve funds and XXXX will not move money to correct account."
2429,"I bank with Wells Fargo On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Wells Fargo to advise that I was scammed out of {$3500.00} for a vehicle purchase. I sent a XXXX transfer on XX/XX/XXXX for this vehicle purchase not realizing I was being scammed. Wells Fargo promotes XXXX on their website so this made me feel comfortable using this service under my Wells Fargo account. I felt XXXX was a legit service and if anything went wrong my bank Wells Fargo would step in to help. After all I'm sending money to another bank so if anything went wrong, my bank would do everything possible to retrieve my money. I didn't expect anything to go wrong but little did I know it did. I explained on XX/XX/XXXX when I first filed my complaint under claim # XXXX {$3500.00} dispute. That I was dealing with a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX another name he goes by ) for my vehicle purchase who during the XXXX transaction put in himself the phone number and name of another individual i didn't know which was the name XXXX XXXX who I never met and do not know. I never received my purchase and once I discovered the money went to the wrong person I knew I was scammed and reached out to my bank Wells Fargo. My Wells Fargo confirmation # for the transaction is XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that a representative would call me for additional information about my claim and no one every called me back from Wells Fargo Online Claims Dept. I have been calling for over a month trying to get in touch with a Wells Fargo Supervisor and Manager to find out why my claim # XXXX was closed without giving me any real explanation. I'm being told they know it was a scam but unable to do a chargeback. They can only request my money back from XXXX and refuse to give me provisional credit until they get my refund. I had to call back to re open another claim # XXXX which was given on XX/XX/XXXX and I still have not received a follow up call from a supervisor or manager. I continue to get the run around with Wells Fargo and I'm becoming very impatient because I can't get the help that I need from my bank who I never had issues with until now."
2431,"On Monday XX/XX/2021, around XXXX XXXX Pacific Time I received a text message from Wells Fargo asking if I had made a charge at a XXXX for {$100.00}. I responded to the text with a NO. It is not unusual for me to get these texts from the bank as I am on a fraud alert system with them. I took my kids to school and was about to call the bank when my caller ID showed WELLS FARGO, so I answered. They were calling in regard to the fraudulent charge at XXXX. The person on the other end had my account details and we discussed the fraudulent charges. The person then asked me to read back an authorization code that they texted me, I read the code back to the person. They then told me that my online banking would be suspended for a day while they investigated this. 10 minuets later, I received an email from Wells Fargo saying that my wire transfer for {$24000.00} was initiated. I called the bank within 10 minuets of this email at XXXX XXXX  to report that this was not initiated by me, and that wire fraud had taken place. The banker sent me to the fraud department and a claim was filed ( I will provide claim numbers at the end ). I was very nervous with the bank and insisted that they get in touch with XXXX XXXX  ( where the wire was sent ) to stop the transfer since it was fraudulent. WF told me that the Fraud claim had been initiated. I then called XXXX XXXX  and was told that WF would be handling everything. I proceeded to call WF another 4 times and received several more claim numbers. 

Our account showed "" Pending '' on the wire transfer for about 30 hours. After spending roughly 2 days on the phone with WF claims and fraud departments, we were told that the money was gone, and that our claim was denied. We have continued to talk to WF on a daily basis and they continue to tell us that it is not their problem. We have a text and phone call trail that shows that it IS their problem, and that WF did not get into contact with the receiving bank for 30 HOURS,,,,, I called within 10 minuets in which time the fraud could have been stopped. WF then proceeded to imply that we ourselves were involved in this transfer which is completely bogus. 

We have filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and are still getting no answers from WF. They continue to deny our claim and essentially have stolen $ XXXX from us. Please see all claim numbers below for WF Expedited Claim # filed immediately after email regarding wire transfer # XXXX phone contact XXXX Separate wire fraud claim same day filed # XXXX I spoke with 4 separate bankers on the XXXX to stop the wire We continued on this path and were given several more case numbers # XXXX escalation to supervisor phone XXXX Another case manager was given to us # XXXX contact XXXX : XXXX WE also had another fraud person at WF supervisor who told us that WF should have stopped this wire as it was from a new device and IP address in Virginia, we live in California. Her name is XXXX XXXX We then get a message from the dispute resolution department saying : "" we have determined that the transaction was performed by someone who had your authorization '' My authorization was a code that was sent to my text/phone by WELLS FARGO XXXX 

This is absolutely criminal"
2433,"On Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX I was promised a product over the internet through XXXX XXXX for the amount of {$640.00} the person sending the product XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX sent detailed photos of it as well, we talked for a few hours and I sent the payment over through XXXX XXXX to the account of XXXX XXXX, after asking him if he had shipped the item constantly he finally blocked my number and stopped answering my messages on the phone number XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX, and the XXXX XXXX app, i kept messaging the person in hopes that hed respond and requested a refund on the XXXX  app I contacted Wells Fargo immediately that same night as I had just realized I had been scammed, I took 13 days for Wells Fargo to resolve my claim which ended in a denial, them claiming that it was denied because it was a authorized transaction .they did not provide a provisional credit or any support in the meantime the case was being solved, I am now lost of {$640.00} and in the process of appealing and escalating the claim through wells fargo, I just found out about the cfpb which is why I didnt reach out sooner."
2434,"Wells Fargo has 2 Cashiers Checks which were lost/stolen. Their Bank at XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX in XXXX, NV refused to cooperate to locate the funds as the Branch Manager asked me to leave the Branch and called building security. 

The check of {$1500.00} is serial number XXXX, Account XXXX payable XXXX to XXXX XXXX and {$7000.00} serial number XXXX, Account number XXXX issued XXXX payable to XXXX XXXX. 

The Bank needs to trace the funds to determine which Cashiers Checks are missing and re-issue them. 

The {$7000.00} Check is from the XXXX, NV Branch on XXXX XXXX. 

Both Branches have not re-issued the lost/stolen Checks. 

The accompanying checks were cashed by me and other checks were issued ; these are the checks lost/stolen."
2438,WE SOLD A VEHICLE ON XX/XX/2021 AND WERE GIVEN A CASHIERS CHECK FOR PAYMENT. WE DEPOSITED THE CHECK ON XXXX TO OUR BANK WELLS FARGO AND WERE GIVEN A DATE OF XX/XX/2021 FOR THOSE FUNDS TO BE RELEASED. THAT DATE CAME AND FUNDS WERE NOT RELEASED. WE IMMEDIATELY CALLED WELLS FARGO TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WERE GIVEN A MESSAGE TO CONTACT THE ISSUER OF THE CHECK. THIS WAS THE MESSAGE THAT WAS GIVEN TO WELLS FARGO. XXXX XXXX XXXX WAS WHO ISSUED THE CHECK.. THEY TOLD US THE FUNDS WERE RELEASED ON XX/XX/2021 AND THAT EVERYTHING WAS FINE. WELLS FARGO IS SAYING NOTHING OTHER THEN THEY HAVE NOT RELEASED THE FUNDS AND THE ISSUE IS WITH XXXX  XXXX XXXX. THE CHECK WAS FOR {$19000.00} DOLLARS AND WE HAVE YET TO RECIEVE A LOGICAL EXPLAINATION OF WHO HAS THE FUNDS AND WHERE THEY ARE. BOTH BANKS ARE BLAMING EACH OTHER AND NO ONE HAS A DIFINITIVE ANSWER. WELLS FARGO IS SAYING THAT XXXX  XXXX XXXX HAS NOT RELEASED THE FUNDS AND XXXX XXXX XXXX IS SAYING THAT WELLS FARGO HAS NOT RELEASED THE FUNDS.
2439,"I was purchasing something over XXXX of {$170.00}, turns out it was a scam and the person never returned my money. The money was sent on XXXX XXXX. I sent the case to Wells Fargo but they didnt approve of my claim on XXXX XXXX and my card was charged back of {$170.00}."
2441,"On XX/XX/2021 I received a cut off notice from XXXX XXXX informing me that I was behind on my bills and my electricity would be shut off within thirty minutes if I did not send an outstanding balance of {$490.00}. They walked me through my Wells Fargo account and finding the XXXX application. 
After wiring the money, I did not see the payment posted on my XXXX  account so I realized I was the victim of a scam. I called Wells Fargo immediately and filed a claim. They have not covered the amount even though they state they offer 100 % fraud protection. The only reason I used the XXXX app is because its on my Wells Fargo app which I did not ask for so it seemed as if it was safe and backed by my bank."
2442,"On XX/XX/XXXXI went out with my partner to a bar to celebrate a friends birthday. While at the bar my phone was stolen. I did not notice right away since i was out celebrating. I had use my bank account app earlier that day to send money to my partner. When i realized my phone was missing I alerted the security guards about it. They helped me look for it since my friend works at this place. While searching for it someone unknown to me came forward and said they had found it. They admit it to using it to call someone to pick them up which at the moment I didnt pay attention to it ; I was just happy that I had found the phone. Later that night I checked my account to make sure i had enough money for breakfast next morning. I then noticed {$1500.00} missing from my account. I immediately contacted the bank, Wells Fargo, and the representative did not help. They didnt even take my information to look my accounts up. They just told me XXXX could not be recall so there was nothing they could do. I called again the next morning and spoke with a different representative. They took my information and i told them {$1000.00} were sent from my savings to a person named XXXX XXXX, and another {$500.00} were taken from another of my savings and sent to another name XXXX XXXX. Both persons unknown to me. I told them i did not authorize those transactions. The representative did not ask me any details about what happened. They just marked the transactions. I was not even provided a claim number. I called that same day again in the afternoon to make sure the claim had been directed correctly since no details were asked. The representative told me that the claim had been filed as Non fraud. I informed her to please file it correctly because i had not authorize those transactions. She told me she had fix the issue and would give a solution promptly. On Friday XX/XX/XXXX i called Wells Fargo again to follow up with the investigation. I was informed by the representative that the claim was still showing as non fraud. I demanded the claim be escalated because things werent been filed correctly. She brought it to managers attention and corrected the issue. I called once more on Monday XX/XX/XXXX and the representative told me fraud had been confirmed. I was helped switch account numbers and log in credentials and given a new debit card. They told me the reimbursement was still in process. On XX/XX/XXXX i was informed the claimed had been forwarded to the wrong department and had been closed out. I explained how could they close it if i had not authorize those transactions. Not only i have never sent money to this people before. They were added the same night and {$1500.00} had been sent out without my consent. I only bank with Wells Fargo so they can see all of my transactions and they can see ive never sent this people money. I only send to my immediate family or friends. If they are questioning my convictions they also have access to see that. I had worked for Wells Fargo for almost 6 years. If they could not take my word on the situation happening, they could reach out to management or check my records as their employee to verify what kind of person i am. I know the rules and they are refusing to help me. The representative i was speaking to told me that the people looking over my claim dont know the back story of what happened to me. I was asked to submit a letter in regards to what happened so they could open my claim again. I submitted the letter to them on XX/XX/XXXX, i was told someone will contact me to further ask me questions. No one ever called me. I visited a branch on XX/XX/XXXX and explained my situation to the banker again. They put me on the phone and representative told me they could not help me unless the banker stayed with me throughout the whole interaction. No one was available so i had to visit a different branch. I finally got a banker to sit with me and try to file another claim. We were transferred to multiple departments and was finally told we could not file another claim since the previous one was already closed. We asked to escalate the complaint and the rep did no ask us any details on the issue. I wasnt even provided a reference number. I asked the banker in-front of me to escalate the complaint herself with details of my situation. She did that. On XX/XX/XXXX i was informed the Escalated complaint filed at the branch was declined since there was a duplicate of the rep on the phone. They declined my detailed complaint. Wells fargo sent me an email acknowledging the complaint escalated by the phone rep. I never heard anything else from them. I was just told I would get a resolution by XX/XX/XXXX. I called XX/XX/XXXX and was informed once again the complaint had been closed with no resolution at all. At this point Wells Fargo is clearly refusing to help me. They have refused to listen to my situation. They are not Only turning their back on a long time customer but to a once employee they told was the face of Wells Fargo. They clearly have access to all my records of my accounts and can see no transactions like those were made before and are still refusing to help me. They have given me the run around from day one."
2443,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted on XXXX by the user name XXXX. 
I thought this was the day trader willing to give me training and invest my money. 
This user then told me to text him. He told me about an investment process that he would show me to make a ROI of XXXX dollars. ( I have all screenshots attached ). I sent a total of XXXX dollars to the website XXXX XXXX XXXX using the bitcoin wallet address XXXX. I was told I will receive my money back in XXXX hours. I then came to the conclusion he was not the real "" XXXX ''."
2447,"On XX/XX/2022 I had seen a XXXX transfer from my bank account thats associated with Wells Fargo of XXXX to someone who registered my information on their XXXX account and also had changed my information that was on my XXXX XXXX, that transaction wasnt authorized by me or did I send that amount of money I filed a claim with Wells Fargo and weeks later my claim was denied I asked what further documents do I need to show just prove that it wasnt me I was then told I authorized the transaction which was not the case and they stated theres nothing more I can do on my end. when I closed out my account and when I received an email of my account being closed I noticed the name of my account that I had closed out was under XXXX XXXX which who I do not know of. A lot of money was taken out of my account which caused a hardship on me and Wells Fargo does not was replace the money that was taken from me its really frustrating that my bank doesnt want to help me out this is the first time something like this has ever happened to me."
2449,"On XX/XX/2021 I went to local Wells Fargo ( XXXX, UT ) to open savings account attached to checking acct. After account was opened I deposited a foreign check into that account for the amount of XXXX XXXX. This check was an interim check for a settelment offer from the XXXX Government for XXXX 's XXXX survivors. The branch converted the amount to USD in the amount of {$16000.00}. This amount was posted to account on XXXX, on XXXX I was informed by branch manager that now the check had came back as a stop payment. They informed me that not only an I paying returned check fee of XXXX I now owe XXXX because the conversation had changed, however statement shows XXXX was return payment. I contacted them and customer service could not give any information as to what had happened so I contacted the issuers of the check. XXXX has the undertaking to disburse checks to claimants, they stated that there should be no issue with the payment and the bank in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and perhaps there was a clerical, human or computer error and no stop payment was issued. They ( XXXX  ) stated they would contact Wells Fargo to inform them payment legitimate and to reprocess the payment. I then contacted wells fargo again to inform them that they would be receiving a call from XXXX to verify payment, I was told they would not do anything as they use a third party to deal with international checks and a new check would have to be issued also that they did not remove the fees for this transaction. If wells Fargo neglected to confirm check via wire or contacting bank any issues should fall on them not customer."
2451,"On XX/XX/17 I tried to transfer money from my Wells Fargo account to a cleaning service who had done sone work cleaning my home in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. My family and I have recently relocated to XXXX XXXX with my husbands job and I am preparing my home to be sold. The amount of my money that Wells Fargo has lost is {$750.00}. This a huge amount of money to me and was an unexpected expense as well. I desperately need to recover these funds, here is what happened. XX/XX/17, I went on the Wells Fargo website on my mobile device and was directed to their funds transfer service. I entered in the account information, routing and other information to the Wells Fargo funds transfer page exactly as the cleaning service had given me. The information given to Wells Fargo was confirmed several times before and since XX/XX/17 with my cleaning service. The directions for a non-Wells Fargo account were followed and it was clear that I was transferring funds to a Non Wells Fargo account from the information given ; account and routing. On XX/XX/17 the transfer appeared to have been completed but the next day my cleaning company claimed they had not received their funds. I called Wells Fargo and told them the fund transfer was not successful. I was told that I had to file a claim and it would take 10 days to research what happened. This was the beginning of daily calls to Wells Fargo where I was given conflicting information, misled, given various explanations and treated rudely and with no apparent concern for my situation. As I have pieced everything together it looks like Wells Fargo transferred the funds into another Wells Fargo client 's account, not the intended account which they were given the accurate information for. In speaking with Wells Fargo employees over the last week it seems that the funds were transferred immediately into the wrong account and were transferred using a phone number rather than the routing number and account number, designating the proper bank. I have bank and transfer statements electronically stored to back up the transaction. It also seems that Wells Fargo is well aware of where they misdirected my funds and to whom, as it is a Wells Fargo client. it looks like they do not want to admit their error and are as of today, absolutely unwilling to help me. Today, XX/XX/17 I was told abruptly by Wells Fargo that there was nothing they could do and that I had to take the problem up with the cleaning company. I have been in touch with the cleaning company consistently since this began. They are a small local mom and pop business who can not afford to loose {$750.00} either and they have confirmed the information for the transfer with me numerous times. They are as well, shocked at Wells Fargo for losing this money and using their phone number as an account number when they do not even have a Wells Fargo account. They went down to Wells Fargo today with all their information in an effort to try and find where this money went and to prove that they had never received these funds and as well, wether they have a security concern over their phone number and a Wells Fargo account. They were told by Wells Fargo that they would not be given any information on the case at all. I believe that in addition to loosing my funds, my Wells Fargo account is no longer safe and Wells Fargo 's funds transfer practices are dangerous for their customers and consumers in general. Finally, today, I was told by Wells Fargo that although the name on the recipient 's account did not match phone or account number they 'sent the funds anyway '.!! I am desperate to have this situation resolved and to have my funds returned to me. In good faith I have paid my cleaning crew, they did not deserve to suffer for the negligence of the bank and I am currently out of pocket {$1500.00}. Wells Fargo wasted 13 days telling me they were 'woking on my case ' until today just tuning their back on me. Wells Fargo knows exactly which account they put the money in and they also know full well where the funds should have gone. Their sloppy handling of my money is unacceptable and worse, their refusal to make good their mistake is in my opinion negligence. I relied on Wells Fargo to handle my money responsibly and they lost it and simply do n't care and can not be bothered to fix the problem. I am reaching out to CFPB for guidance and assistance in resolving this problem. I intend to file a police report if CFPB feels that is a good approach. I will pursue this until I have resolution."
2452,"I was called twice the evening of XX/XX/XXXX from what appeared to be a Wells Fargo number ( XXXX ). I picked up on the second call and the person said they were a Wells Fargo customer service representative ( he said his name was XXXX XXXX and that someone had accessed my Wells Fargo debit card and made a purchase. He asked me to confirm my name and my account number. I checked my account and saw that a purchase of {$0.00} had been made ( the merchant name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX merchant address : XXXX XXXX, PA, XXXX, category : government services not elsewhere classified ). He then said they had tried to make 3 additional transactions, but that I needed to XXXX myself in order to get those transactions back ( because they were pending ). They had me add myself as a XXXX XXXXecipient, and tell them the confirmation code I received from Wells Fargo when I added my phone number. I completed the first transaction ( the first was for {$1000.00} ). After this, I looked up the number they were calling from to make sure it was from Wells Fargo and it was so I completed the second transaction which was for {$700.00}. They told me I needed to complete all 3 ( the third was for {$2600.00} ) in order to have the money come out of holding from XXXX. That is when I began to grow suspicious. I looked up XXXX XXXX and saw that scammers could mask their phone calls to look like it was coming from a bank. At this point I had my sister record the rest of the phone call. I asked again when I would be getting my money back and he kept saying I needed to complete the third transaction ( he got very agitated ). He finally gave up his pretense ( he said XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and hung up. 
My sister called Wells Fargo customer service for me and I reported the scam. I filed official claims for the {$0.00} transaction, the {$1000.00} XXXX, and the {$700.00} XXXX The person I spoke with told me they were unable to stop or reverse the funds. I was told that they would follow up with me over the phone in XXXX business days, but I never received a call. 

After getting off the phone with Wells Fargo customer service, I filed a police report with XXXX XXXX Police Department ( XX/XX/XXXX ). An XXXX in the financial crimes unit followed up with me on XX/XX/XXXX saying that XXXX would not be able to recover my funds and suggested report it to XXXX and to follow up with my bank. They also suggested I report this to the FTC and the IC3 and to send any additional info I had. I told the officer that I already reported it to Wells Fargo and I sent them screenshots of the {$0.00} transaction and a scam text message I received on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX Fraud saying that they decline a {$2600.00} transaction on a card ending in a number I was unfamiliar with. 

I received an email on XX/XX/XXXX from Wells Fargo saying that their investigation was completed. I received 3 letters in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX from Wells Fargo. They reiterated that they were unable to stop/reverse the funds and that they determined that the payments were processed as requested. They also indicated that they contacted the receiving institution and XXXX to see if either of them would be able to do anything about the scam. 

I called Wells Fargo to follow up about the letters and they told me that Wells Fargo would not be able to return my funds and reiterated that they contacted the receiving institution and XXXX. I told them again that I was under the impression that I was sending the payment to myself, but they still said that I authorized payment ( to the unknown person ). They told me that they would follow up in the mail about the receiving institution and XXXX. I decided to report this here because Ive read that XXXX and most banks tend to try not to claim fault ( even if the scammer impersonated the victims bank and asked for personal information )."
2455,"I began communication with XXXX  in the XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2021. I was interested in the XXXX XXXX  Double Flap handbag. Initial conversation and any questions I proceeded to ask received a swift reply. After several email exchanges, I began making payments on XX/XX/2021 for the XXXX XXXX Double Flap. The first payment of {$500.00} was sent via XXXX. Due to XXXX having daily limits, I sent the remainder of the deposit via XXXX. I completed my final payment on XX/XX/2021. I continued to follow up on shipping, to no avail. XXXX informed me that the seller had yet to send them tracking, and that they thought it was best to just refund my money. Following which, I agreed and continuously requested a refund, as my emails began to go unanswered. The email associated with my XXXX account was requested several times, and I responded each time with the same email address, which was also the email I responded from the entirety of the conversation exchange. Several days went by with no response. XXXX then informed me they received a tracking number on XX/XX/2021. Once I received the bag, I realized it was a single flap, and not a double flap that was agreed upon, and which I paid for. I contacted XXXX once again and explained this. They attempted to explain it must have been a mix up, however they offered no refund. Since I was responding from the original communication chain, I scrolled up to screenshot the previous conversation exchanges and attached them to my request. After several emails, they agreed to a full refund. I then prepared the bag and shipped it back on XX/XX/2021. Once the bag was received, they explained they must now sell the bag in order to refund my money. I was then told I would receive a full refund by XX/XX/2021. I have emailed numerous times, and even had to be admitted to the hospital due to XXXX  To date of filing this complaint, I have not received a single cent from the {$4900.00} that I paid for the handbag. 

Because XXXX is a "" peer to peer '' platform, my bank Wells Fargo as well as XXXX indicated that they can not do anything for me. My bank also indicated that the XXXX transfers were initiated by me and not a mistake that the bank completed, thus once again, I have no solution to the {$4900.00} that was stolen from me."
2457,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was scammed through XXXX and had {$1000.00} sent to a recipient, claiming by the caller they were the bank and they were helping me reverse the transaction. The recipient email was entered as XXXX and my name was entered into recipient name area. XXXX XXXX was put into the memo line of the transfer. After the money was taken from my account I called my bank fraud department ( wells fargo ) and filed a claim within minutes of this happening, claim number XXXX. I was told the money would be returned to my account within 10 days. The bank provided a provisional credit while they looked into the case. On XX/XX/XXXX the bank took back the provisional credit of {$1000.00} stating the case was closed on XX/XX/XXXX and my claim was denied because I authorized the transaction and the money went to the designated recipient. I called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX and was told someone would call me back to assist me with reversing the denial. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX after not hearing from the bank and was told someone would be calling within XXXX hours. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email explaining that my claim was denied because the transaction processed correctly."
2459,"The scammer originally convinced me I was being sought after by the FBI, for an XXXX-related case. While they never identified me by my real name, they did seem legit because they were spoofing from XXXX, which is the General Washington DC Court for Criminal department. So what I did, I called the actual department back and they confirmed 2 things : the agent whom I spoke to does not exist in their database and second, that they would never ask for my identity let alone ask me for money over the phone. After putting this all together, I had already submitted {$5500.00} dollars to the scammer to "" avoid being part of the list of suspects ''. I was caught up in all of this from using a fake phone number app, and the scammer stated I would be traced back and arrested based on geolocation from the use of my number in that app. This scammer is out there doing this. I have the scammer 's email, their phone number, and also a receipt of one of the transactions to track this scammer."
2460,"On XX/XX/2021, I received an email from XXXX XXXX XXXX that I made a subscription of {$390.00} which I did not do. They left a XXXX number below the email to call for a refund which I did and spoke to XXXX who told me that I have been refunded and that I can check my account and see if I received the refund. I opened my online banking with Wells Fargo and noticed transfers to XXXX and XXXX on XXXX XXXX and XXXX which I did not do. XXXX told me that he was going to help me recover my money with a dummy money of {$10000.00} that I saw in my account which I need to transfer to one XXXX XXXX in XXXX who is responsible for the illegal transfers in my account. He said that I should not talk to bankers because they want to find out who they are who he said might be working along with the fraudsters. I was directed to go to my bank and make the transfer. I did that. They left a XXXX number to call the next day so that I can get a full report of those that stole my money. I called the number but there was no response. I was told it is not a working number. I ran back to Wells Fargo bank and narrated my experience with these suspected fraudsters. I was given a fraud claim number. 
Each time I called the number I was told that I would be given a new claim because they can not locate my number. After 4 different claims I was directed to the branch manager XXXX XXXX on XXXX 2021, who told me that she was going to escalate my case and that I will receive a response from them in 10-15 days. I waited. I received a protected email from Wells Fargo who told me that after careful investigation that trying to get back the fraudulent wire transfer of {$10000.00} from XXXX all was to no avail. So, for that very reason, I will not receive any claim from the bank."
2461,"XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, / 2021 I have received multi-text from XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX who is Wells Fargo clients. They have given me a death threat to myself, my kids, and my family. They have threatened me that if I don't give them money they will kill my kids and my family. Please someone help me and catch those scammers."
2462,"I was scammed into transferring money via a XXXX transfer. I never even heard of XXXX or asked the bank to place XXXX on my account. On Monday, XX/XX/2022, I received a text from a scammer who pretended to be from Wells Fargo ( please see below ) asking if I was intending to transfer {$3400.00} via XXXX and asked me to respond YES or NO. I responded NO and the scammer then phoned me and said he worked for Wells Fargo and I needed to log into my account to reverse the charges back into my savings account. I did as he said and had no idea, I was transferring money to him, not reversing the charges back to myself. As soon as I hung up, Wells Fargo called me and asked the same question. Was I transferring {$3400.00} out of my savings account? I said, no, however, I just spoke to someone from Wells Fargo and they fixed the issue. The woman from Wells Fargo then informed me that I was scammed. At that point, she was able to stop the {$1400.00} transaction, but was unable to stop the {$100.00} transaction. I filed a false transfer claim with Wells Fargo and was denied ( claim # XXXX ) as I was told that I have no protection with XXXX transfers. Banks should not be able to place anything on an individual 's account, such as XXXX, unless they get permission to do so especially if they do not protect the consumer from scams. I was never told anything about XXXX, therefore, was easily scammed because I was never educated about this transfer process by Wells Fargo. I work extremely hard for my money and can not afford to lose {$1000.00}! I hope you can help, however, if you are not, please let me know if this is something I can take to small claims court."
2463,"On XX/XX/2021 I received a Wells Fargo text message telling me someone was trying to XXXX XXXX dollars out of my account and do I authorize this yes or no I responded no within XXXX I received a phone call a rep. stating he was calling from Wells Fargo and he was calling to stop the transaction and that it was someone from XXXX bank trying to take money from my account they told me they put a hold on the transfer but in order for me to completely stop the transfer I would need to download the app and put the same amount to reverse the transfer and go through XXXX to do it, ( Now ) in the middle of rep talking to me I muted the call and called the number that he called me from XXXX just to make sure and the number connected me to a Wells Fargo branch and it did, so I believed the person. I did the first transfer in the amount of XXXX dollars but when I seen the money leave my account I became worried but the rep reassured me the money would go back into my account, but when my account wouldn't let me do the second transfer that's when my red flag went up the rep said it must be a system problem and he will put a hold on my account and call me back tomorrow same time. I called the bank immediately after the call from the number he called me from the rep told me it was a fraud call and she would have to write up a claim, Wells Fargo closed my case after 10 days but noted my file that it was fraud but since I did the transaction then I am responsible but they will try to get my money back from XXXX, but could not guarantee me anything. You gave advice to woman in XXXX who ended up on the news, I am asking for help XXXX dollars is a lot of money me, please help me."
2464,"I put in a hardship withdrawal request with Wells Fargo to withdraw much needed funds, XX/XX/2017 to consolidate debt and pay past due rent owed to my landlord to avoid eviction, to try and refinance my vehicle, and fix my credit issues. The bank was supposed to send me the paperwork with 2 to 3 business days, it took 10 days to receive the paperwork, i filled out all of the paperwork and submitted the necessary documents and I was told it would take 5 to 7 business days to process and receive a check, i called after 2 weeks wondering why i had not received the funds only to find out that it was direct deposited to a closed account at my bank ( XXXX XXXX ) XXXX XXXX is now holding the funds for 15 days pending a good funds approval. with all of the long drawn out processes, my vehicle has now been reposessed with threat of sale at auction, and i am now being threatened with eviction, Neither Wells Fargo or XXXX XXXX will give me exact answers as to when i will receive my money It is now XX/XX/2017 and i still do not have my money."
2465,"On XX/XX/21 I was contacted by Wells Fargo Fraud department via text about suspicious activity on my account. Given it was just past XXXX I thought maybe one of the retail stores I visited that possibly my card/account info was stolen. As this scenario has happened in the past but was swiftly resolved by closing the card and issuing a new one via my bank. In the midst of this thought process and starting to look into this on my end, I then received a call directly from Wells Fargo online customer service number XXXX. The agent went through a typical speil that I would typically hear from Wells Fargo. After a few minutes, I did hang up and call Wells Fargo number directly XXXX and waited going through the initial system as usual and ended up getting the same person that originally called me and at that time I assumed I was dealing directly with Wells Fargo. They told me there was suspicious activity on my account and they are working to resolve it. In this process I was manipulated into providing a code that I was told was a verification code ( now knowing it was not ). This allowed the scammers access to send an unauthorized fraudulent amount of {$1000.00} using zelle from my account to the scammer 's XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX account. They made it look like the payment was sent to myself and told me I should see a credit. When I logged in I only saw a debit and they said they were going to re-do it again at the same time I received an email with a different Wells Fargo number XXXX showing the XXXX transaction and if it was not made by me to call the number. At this time this didn't feel right so I changed my password on my account and I hung up the call. I called the number immediately after this happened. After speaking with a rep at Wells Fargo they indicated that I was initially dealing with someone not with Wells Fargo but a scammer and they would submit a claim. Claim number XXXX. Under this immediate distress call, I was trying to explain what happened not knowing at the time really what happened and hoping to find support from my bank and to have them contact XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to look into the account the funds were fraudulently sent to, to hopefully freeze or hold the account to investigate the account owner. The person did look at my account to ensure my password was changed and they re-adjusted the XXXX settings back to my account. I was told it takes about 10 days for the claims process and someone in the department would contact me to discuss the details. I called Wells Fargo 3 days later to follow up. I was told the claim has been submitted and they are in the process of reviewing and takes about 10 days and someone will be contacting me to discuss details. After not receiving a call on day 10 I called Wells Fargo and a rep told me that the claim was closed. I disagreed with this action and asked for it to be re-opened and re-considered and that someone that was working on my claim contact me as I was told they would discuss details of what happened. They said they couldn't re-submit the claim as it would just automatically be denied. I was then assigned a customer relations claim number ( XXXX ) and assigned to someone to help me further and told I would be contacted within 2-3 days. After not being contacted I stopped in at my local branch to speak with the banking manager. She looked into this issue and contacted the new claim person/department. She was told they were actively looking into it and I would receive a call within 24 hours. I did receive a call from my now appointed customer relations rep to only be told they couldn't do anything and to contact the initial fraud department with my original claim number. They transferred me over to this department only to be hung up on by the system. To this day XXXX, I never received a call from the fraud department that was assigned to my claim to discuss this case. In my exuberant amount of hours of dealing with this, I have been passed off to Wells Fargo reps who have been nice but have no authority to help in the situation. Not only was I a victim of fraud I now feel like a victim to Wells Fargo and exhausted with this situation. This is not how long time clients or any clients should be treated. Looking into this matter to understand what happened so it doesn't happen to me again or anyone I know I now understand that this specific situation is covered under regulation E per the CFPB Docket No. XXXX and funds should be restored which is the resolution I am seeking. Thank you"
2466,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from who I though was our XXXX XXXX ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ). They confirmed account numbers, service address and names on the billing statement. They stated there was a billing issue and they had changed platforms for billpay and our utility bill had been coming out on the old platform and not the new one so they were contacting me to see why I had not called them to set up payment through the new bill pay platform. This has happened with another utility company in the area - changing billing platforms. So this seemed legit and also because they had my account number, address and both my name and my husbands name on the account. 

The customer service rep stated that we could go through XXXX in order to use billpay through Wells Fargo and walked me through setting up the account - when they gave me the number for the transfer it popped up as XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and they gave me reference numbers and work order numbers. 
I had to complete two transactions - 1 to take care of the bill for XXXX and the second was an amount to initiate the billpay. They gave me a reference number and said to call the utility company tomorrow and confirm payment went through and they would refund the deposit amount back to my account. 

I called my utility company the next day and provided the information and they stated that they had multiple people calling about this issue and it was actually fraudulent and that they were not sure how the scammers had gotten all of the information they had but recommended I contact my bank Wells Fargo to report the fraudulent transaction I called and spoke with customer service for Fraud through XXXX. They took all this same information and said they would take up to 10 business days to check that it was fraudulent and refund the money back to me. They stated that misleading charges would be taken care of. 
I called twice to check on the status of the claim and they stated they needed more time to look into the issue. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that they were not able to refund any money because they actually do not stand behind the XXXX money transfer program through their app and bank. That they do not have a customer gurantee to back anything through this app and since they could not track the fraud through their app they wouldnt be able to get the money back for the bank so they were going to deny my claim. I asked why they didnt disclose this when I filed the claim and she said they only will support transactions they can get the money back from. 
I feel that this is very misleading. Other money transfer and pay options like XXXX will always stand behind their customer and I have had purchases that were fraudulent that XXXX has backed up 100 %. I have been a loyal customer of Wells Fargo for years and they are encouraging the use of a program that they do not stand behind.

He said we had to walk through some steps to avoid the funds from being transferred from my account. 
He said my phone number had been added to an account with XXXX XXXX and asked me to give him a code that was texted to me. After that he told me to go to the XXXX XXXX and put in my own name and phone number to avoid the money from being sent to anyone else. After I did that and hit send he hung up.

The cashiers check and letter are dated from XXXX, but I had just found the document on XX/XX/XXXX. I first tried to call to verify that it would be able to be cashed at a branch, I got no response from any customer service agent at Wells Fargo. I then tried to cash it at a local branch, they said they could not and told me to contact customer service. After many attempts to get this issues resolved, after several agents continuously transferring me to department after department within Wells Fargo customer service I still have no resolution to getting my funds which Im legally entitled to. I have the letter and the check number but yet anytime I speak with Wells Fargo over the phone I am either transferred to the incorrect departments or hung up on."

They stated they could not track where the money went being that XXXX is a 3rd party service, but I recently got a notice in the mail where they were able to track 1 of the claims. How is this possible when they could not track the other claims to verify which account they went into. Wells fargo is playing a game and stealing my money. Why can they not track all the other claims? They just pick one claim and now they can all of a sudden magically track where this one.went. Why can't they track the other claims? I ' ve been a wells fargo customer for over 15 years. I closed my account because of their horrible customer service and the unwillingness to due their due diligence and protect their customer.

This has previously happened to me and the money was compensated because they determined it was indeed fraud. I have been hacked thru two banks and XXXX credit.

I have never used the XXXX app but she talked me thru how to use it thru my Wells Fargo app. I was hesitant at first but she convinced me it was completely safe and necessary in order to not have my account hacked. She then hung up and I called the number back. It went straight to Wells Fargo and I talked to someone and they informed me that I was scammed out of XXXX.

I was in a bad service area at the time. I was under the impression at the time it was an urgent matter. Upon answering the man said he was with the Wells Fargo Fraud Dept. He then started asking me about XXXX transactions and if they were authorized in the amount of {$3500.00}. I said no so he said my account had been compromised and we needed to secure my account against any further transactions. I was driving home at the time from XXXX XXXX to XXXXXXXX XXXX I had taken my husband to pick up his semi-truck.

2483,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was the victim of a XXXX phishing scam via Wells Fargo Bank. Wells Fargo has denied my claim and closed the investigation. 

On afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX I received a text message indicating possible fraudulent activity on my account. I did not respond to the text but within a couple of minutes I received a call from a number in XXXX, Texas ( I live in XXXX, TX, a suburb of XXXX ) with someone telling me they were detecting fraudulent activity within our account. After doing a reverse phone number look-up, the number the caller was using appeared to be a Wells Fargo branch in Texas. 

They proceeded to tell me that the fraudulent activity was a XXXX transfer ( to the payee XXXX XXXX ) for {$3500.00} and was scheduled to go through tomorrow morning. Since I said I was not the person initiating the transfer they instructed me to hold on the line and soon a new call came though but this time the number was the XXXX Wells Fargo number. 

The person on the phone then informed me that since XXXX is a third party application that Wells Fargo could do nothing to stop the transfer and the only recourse was to pay myself the money to offset the impending XXXX transfer. 

I followed through and after the transaction was complete, I asked for a reference number for the case and they hung up. The XXXX transfer still shows in my account with myself as the payee. 

Immediately after that I knew that it had been fraudulent. I called Wells Fargo immediately and after several hours and speaking to three different people we filed a claim. I've attached all communication we have received from Wells Fargo regarding this. We do believe that we should be protected under XXXX XXXX and communicated that to Wells Fargo. We have gotten mixed messages from everyone we have spoken to, which at this point is 12+. I'm not sure what else I can do to dispute this claim and get my money back. I know this is a prevalent scam currently and am writing to file a complaint with the CFPB. If further details or additional information is needed, please contact me. I'm hopeful the people responsible for this will be help accountable and that no one else has to become a victim of this scam."
2485,"This morning ( XX/XX/2019 ) I went to my Bank here in XXXX XXXX XXXX, Az to deposit a cheque. 
My wife and I are XXXX snowbirds and I am currently down at our home for about four weeks before returning home to XXXX. 
Since purchasing our home here, we have done all our banking with Wells Fargo. 
Before I left for the bank this morning, I typed into XXXX "" What will {$1400.00} in XXXX dollars equate to in American dollars at Wells Fargo. I was then sent to a Wells Fargo website with a currency calculator. I entered the amount and it said I would get {$1100.00} in exchange. 
I then drove to my bank and proceeded to make the deposit. 
I asked the teller exactly what amount they were depositing in exchange for my {$1400.00}. XXXX. 
I was told it would be {$1000.00}. 
When I said that did not match the amount I had just been told less than half an hour earlier, the teller said she had no idea why the numbers were different and I would have to talk with one of their service agents. 
I then went to the appropriate area and was soon speaking with a young lady who upon hearing my question, pulled up the same website and got the same figure I had been provided. After checking various screens she said she had no idea why there was a {$91.00} difference in what Wells Fargo gave me for my deposit. She then said she would have to speak with the Branch Manager to try and get an answer. When she returned a couple of minute later, she said the difference was because I had deposited a cheque rather than cash. 
When I pointed out that was approximately a 8 % fee and that a {$91.00} dollar difference seemed to be unusually high, I was told she did not know the exact rates - just that her Manager had said the difference between what their website said and what they actually gave me was due solely because I deposited a cheque and not cash. 
As it was clear nothing further was going to be forthcoming, I thanked for her help and left. 
Could you please confirm for me if such a high fee for depositing a cheque written on one of my XXXX bank accounts is reasonable? 
And if this is so, should their website not distinguish between cash and cheques when providing a rate on their Currency Calculator, so a user is not left with the shock of losing an additional {$91.00} ( due to some fee even the banks own staff are not aware of ). 
Thank you for your help in clarifying this matter for me.

2486,"Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( XXXXFTA ), Regulation E. My occurrence is similar to XXXX XXXX 's occurrence yet she was provided her money back but I was not. Furthermore, Wellsfargo attempted to contact said scammers that took my money, which is a failed effort since the scammers would have absolutely no reason to refund me. Wells Fargo has failed to uphold the Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ), Regulation. I have made claims with the CFPB about this case on three other occasions ; XX/XX/2021, XX/XX/2021, and XX/XX/2021 all being provided with similar responses that I feel to be unjust. If the investigation was done properly, you would find that the recipients on XXXX are scammer accounts to which I fell victim to. Files are provided below. On XX/XX/2021, I was caught up in a check fraud scam and I was scammed out of {$4000.00} total from my checkings account. The check was written to me by the scammer and sent via XXXX, who had added me on XX/XX/2021, explaining how they wanted to take care of me financially, with the check bank being "" XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX '' with a total of {$4700.00} and I was told that {$700.00} would be compensation for doing menial tasks of transferring the majority of the money to the designated accounts instructed. The check was deposited by me on XX/XX/2021, and since {$400.00} was immediately present in my account I was under the impression that the check was legitimate. I discovered that the check was fake only after the money had been transferred because of how persistent and aggressive the scammer was. {$3400.00} was scammed from me via XXXX with four transactions : 1 transaction being {$400.00} on XX/XX/2021, and XXXX transactions being {$1000.00} each on XX/XX/2021. The other {$600.00} was scammed from me via XXXX on XX/XX/2021 ; this was only one transaction. On XX/XX/2021, I made a claim with Wells Fargo about the scam in an attempt to obtain my money back. The XXXX claim for {$3400.00} was made on XX/XX/2021, but I was instructed by a Wells Fargo representative to make another claim for XXXX since the transaction was not complete on my statement record until XX/XX/2021. On XX/XX/2021, XXXX was also contacted about the scam and my XXXX account was frozen. On XX/XX/2021, a claim for {$600.00} was made. On XX/XX/2021, I made a claim with "" CFPB '' to ensure that I would get my lump sum back. On XX/XX/2021, my "" CFPB '' complaint was closed since Wells Fargo responded. On XX/XX/2021, {$600.00} was returned to my account. On XX/XX/2021, I was called to ask the status of these two claims since I was never provided an update : the XXXX claim was deemed to be non-refundable since the transaction was made by me and not by someone else through hacking ; On XX/XX/2021, I was met with the same response meaning Wells Fargo is not complying with Regulation E of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and only contacted the scammer to get the money refunded rather than reimbursing me. I believe I am still owed my lump sum back because of the "" Electronic Fund Transfer Act ( EFTA ) specifically Regulation E '' since I was convinced thinking that this was a legitimate interaction and was "" promised '' a specific amount, but in reality, none of it was true. I would just like the remaining {$3400.00} provided back to me since it is such a large amount to me."
2488,on ( XX/XX/2021 around XXXX XXXX XXXX time ) I XXXX a search for XXXX customer service number to start a claim for some faulty product I purchased. When I got the result a number popped up.I dailies it. Ot knowing it was a hacker or scammer.I told this person what happened with XXXX.An unawareingly accepted his new policy of using my bank info to transfer a refund.He took me though alot of links and assured me that this is how they pay you back on XXXX.Since I had never been hacked and XXXX is such a trusted company.I followed all his instructions and proceeded to transfer {$500.00} to this crook because the way he explained it.I needed to transfer to this account to get my full refund.I never fall prey to this stuff but since he was skilled in rebuttles and it was XXXX I had used over 10 years.I did it.I kept asking him why do I need to transfer that amount.He assured me it wasn't really $ XXXX.Its to make sure I have money to send my refund.Then he told me to download this app on my phone.I since then learned it's a stalker spy app that let 's him see my entire phone.Now he's telling me my XXXX info so once again I was assured it was XXXX.He was smoothe. Eventually after sending the {$500.00} I got weary and demanded to speak with a supervisor and he said '' XXXX XXXX  '' twice..that 's when I realized I had to hurry off the phone an call Wells Fargo.I filed a aim that second and froze my accounts. The reason I am contacting you is as you know.Wells Fargo.The crooks that they are.Have a policy.They deny all claims of authorized transactions. No matter how elaborate or new the scam was.The claims rep told me that that identical scam had happened twice already that day to other customers.I waited 10 days and knowing they would deny me.I searched for another course of action.And found you all.Mamy people have gotten their hard earned money back because of the CFPB.I find it utterly offensive that Wells Fargo is the only bank that has this policy. Especially for special circumstances. In my case.a hacker hacked into XXXX  server or XXXX.i never met this person..they may be in XXXX..and I didn't recieve any merchandise. So it's clear as day this was a scam.I don't send random people.money ever.Now if this happened to me twice.I would understand but I think they should honor a valued customer. Please help.
2490,"I received a phone call on XX/XX/2021 from XXXX ( this is the WF fraud department ) as I was driving. The representative calling informed me my card ending in XXXX had been compromised and someone was trying to use this card in XXXX at a XXXX XXXX and asked if it was me. I quickly responded, No that was not me. She then asked about the last 5 or so transactions to ensure they were accurate. She advised to cut up the card and WF would send a new card in the mail. She then said, did you set up a wire transfer in the amount of {$5400.00} to which I said absolutely not. She said, o.k Im sending you a confirmation number to your phone number I need you to confirm your identity please read me that confirmation number. I glared at my phone, as Im driving to report the number in which I do. She asked if I had received an email confirming these details and I quickly glance in which I read the details and at the bottom it says if you feel this is fraudulent call XXXX. I stare at the phone number on my phone and the number to call from my email for WF fraud and the numbers are the same, so Im pretty confident Im being accurately helped. She then asked if I had initiated a wire in the amount of {$19000.00}. That absolutely wasnt me! She again asked for the confirmation code being sent to my phone and I report it back to her. At this point Im starting to become suspicious as to why I would have to confirm my identity again. I pull over to read the texts and the texts state do not share this number with anyone. I inquire with the representative and she states that all calls are monitored and recorded and she needed the numbers to confirm my identity. I inform her that I dont feel comfortable and that Im heading into the nearest branch. She responded by saying, absolutely head into the branch, any extra layer of protection for your account is better for you. I immediately head into the branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX. I frantically rush into the branch with her still on the phone and ask the seated representative for help. He asks me to wait in line at the teller and about 1 minute later she hangs up. About 8 minutes go by until I can be helped in the branch. When they pull up my account 2 pending wire transactions are on the screen and I advise they were not from me. The representative at the branch calls the fraud department and at that point I felt that everything would be o.k. Well here I am 2 weeks later out of {$24000.00}."

Even though it was my name and my phone number on the XXXX XXXX, the money was, of course, routed to the thief. I immediately called Wells Fargo and was issued a provisional refund of the {$2500.00} while they investigated. Yesterday I received two letters from Wells Fargo Fraud Department, one for each transaction, telling me that the provisional refund would be taken out of my account on XX/XX/XXXX as there was no evidence of fraud. I was completely taken in by this person, spoofing Wells Fargo, then spoofing my phone number and name to take {$2500.00} from me. Does Regulation E : Electronic Fund Transfers not protect me against this kind of fraud? 

Wells Fargo did take the provisional refund out of my account yesterday. I wrote a letter to the bank a week ago, included the police report but have not heard back from them."

2513,"I took specific instructions to my local  Wells Fargo office to conduct a wire transfer, at that time, I had n't noticed that the transfer was n't  exactly in accordance with the printed out instructions. When speaking with the recipient I was made aware of the importance that it be transmitted in exactly the manner of the instructions, which it was n't. I realize that it was a partnership between my bank and myself, of which I realize that a simple mistake made by my bank, I had not caught, and returned to my bank, to correct it. That is when I encountered "" issues '', starting with being h  eld hostage to Wells Fargo 's priorities pertaining to ( 1 ) Profits First, & then ( 2 ) protect Wells Fargo from any chances that the customer ( s ) may have unfettered access and full utilization of his/hers ( their ) funds, & ( 3 ) is constantly bombarded with "" notifications '' of the additionally added costs to ( a ) canceling the privious transfer, since, Wells Fargo 's system, in my sistuation, could not make an addendum & /or correction, in a timely fashion. All throughout this interaction, I kept expressing the "" timeliness '' of this transaction is crucial. Which appears to have fallen upon deft ears. After going around for about an hour, being repeatedly bombarded with the Bank 's notifying me with "" this is going to cost .... '' statements, & "" Wells Fargo 's procedures are ... '' statements predominating the conversation, we were finally able the get Wells Fargo 's agent ( s ) to respect, and initiate MY WISHES, with regards to MY MONEY & MY ACCOUNT! By this point tensions are high, nerves were a bit frayed, & professional interactions between myself and Wells Fargo 's agent was strained, since in all of this interaction ( A ) the agent wanted to leave early, ( B ) my insistence that we get the transact done that day, & ( C ) that this was a "" Time Sentive/Critical Issue. Once the cancellation was initiated the agent just sat ther waiting for me to leave, and I gave her some time, fully expecting her to get started on the second half of the corrective action, I.e. Initiate a Second Wire Transfer to correct the mistakes of the First Transfer, she had to be prompted. All throughout this transaction, my needs, that of the account holder, was disregarded and subjugated to the ensurance of Wells Fargo generating fees, and bending the account holders ' concerns and needs to the desire of Wells Fargo to generate fees & channel his business concerns through the desires of Wells Fargo, even IF it is to the detriment of the account holder. My desire to sent the correct amount, with the correct "" Special Instructions '', to the correct destination was Soo far off of either the local agent 's agenda, and those of the internal "" phone agents '', that post initiating the cancellation, I had to prompt the local agent to realize that they HAD NOT FIXED ANYTHING! The correct funds was not going to the correct account, with the correct special instructions. Then I had to motivate her to get started on that, of which, I was promptly bombarded with notifications about additional "" redundant '' charges. There was no acceptance of her/Wells Fargo 's culpability with regards to the error, nor as their and hint of her waiving any additional charges, even if it was her that did not follow the instructions as provided, only her telling me of more charges.
When I spoke to Wells Fargo 's customer services re  p, a  XXXX   XXXX , after being handed off from  XXXX   XXXX , there was essences of indifference, arrogance, contempt, condensation and passive aggressiveness but NEVER a direct interaction, addressing either my frustrations or my need to understand how training can rue out the "" customer "" in customer services, of address the need to meet the customers needs when they come in the bank, WHILE generating fees fo  r Wells Fargo. One would hope that if a bank is going to generate fees for services rendered, that they could at least RENDER SREVICES at some point. It appears that Wells Fargo will continue to attempt to generate within their customers a sense of helplessness and submission to whatever rules/regulations that put the customers at the disadvantage, with such contempt that the motivation for patronizeing their facilities is such a distance concern, that the agents are subject to forgetting or discarding it all together. I guess their attitude is that the customer exists to generate profits for Wells Fargo, the services that Wells Fargo market, and the customers come, fully expecting to utilize is purely the "" bait '' portion of the "" Bait- & -Switch ''.
One would hope that the very same training that taught the lower echelon employees to adhere to a tactic of churning accounts in the past, is still permeating throughout the ranks, because their was NO ONE demonstrating even the slightest concerns as to how they were coming off to me, the account holder, only their adherence to instructions, the fees that will, or must be generated, not even a hint of personal or professional culpability/responsibility to the customer for their errors, or even attempting to improve/restore the image of Wells Fargo, just "" quasi-justifications '' for additional fees, and still they ( initially ) forgot the "" services '' that the fees were to be charged for."

2523,"I used a tax preparer to file my income taxes for XXXX in XXXX of this year ( XXXX ). Once I sent him all of the pertinent information, he told me what my return amount would be.

My refund never showed up in the account that I authorized the XXXX preparer to send it to. 
I later found out that the preparer had my refund routed to a third-party service then known as XXXX ( now XXXX Bank ) , that he had allegedly taken his fee out via their bank, they had also taken out their fees, and then he allegedly sent the remainder of my refund to a completely different financial institution ( Wells Fargo ) than I had authorized him to. I reported this incident to the IRS and was told to contact the preparer ( who can no longer be reached... surprise surprise!!! ) and they also did an investigation ( if that's what you want to call it ) that took XXXX months. After those XXXX months, I still have no resolution. I have reached out multiple times to both XXXX Bank ( XXXX XXXX ) and Wells Fargo and they both continue to pass the buck and play games with my money/livelihood. XXXX Bank maintains that Wells Fargo is not cooperating with them, and Wells Fargo claims that they have no record of any wrongdoing, because they don't have the account information in order to investigate. However, XXXX Bank claims they have sent numerous faxes and e-mail to Wells Fargo requesting that they fill out an indemnity form, but Wells Fargo Execs and branch representatives continue to claim that they ( allegedly ) have never received anything from sender ( XXXX Bank ). So, here I am, months later, still without my refund because of an apparent scammer and ***hole who has inconvenienced me and my family ( of whom includes a XXXX XXXX ) beyond measure. Luckily, a taxpayer advocate did assist me recently and gave me some pretty valuable information/advice to proceed with things. I just want this situation resolved so I can move on with my life and continue to take care of my family. I'm a single parent ( not by choice ) after COVID hit, and enduring such an unplanned event is taking a toll on my health.

He then walked me thru, step by step of opening my banking app, to get me into the XXXX function on the wells fargo banking app. At this time {$1000.00} from my Wells Fargo Account was fraudulently transferred into a XXXX XXXX  account that I had no knowledge of. I never authorized any transaction other than to myself by the use of the XXXX App. I became suspicious of the call, after I didnt see the money reappear into my account like he said it would, I began asking questions to the caller, and then he hung up on me. Within seconds of this transaction, I called Wells Fargo main number ( the same number that called me ) to inform them of what just occurred and reported this unauthorized transaction. However, the wait time was so long, especially after waiting to speak to 2 different Wells Fargo representatives, it took over an hour to get a claim number, and they said they apologize but there is nothing they could do, that the money is gone. I had a lot of questions of what to do next, and the representative said she will connect me to someone who can answer all my questions, specifically about taking screen shots of certain things to send them. However, she did say that a police report was not necessary once I have a claim number, because they will investigate it. Well, she ended up transferring me to the wrong person at the conclusion of our conversation, and the new Wells Fargo representative I was connected to could not assist me, nor did she know who at Wells Fargo could help me since I already had a claim number from the fraud unit. I called back a few hours later hoping to be able to be connected to someone who can tell me what to do next, and again I was told the same thing, if I had a claim number, there is nothing left to do and someone will reach out to me. A week later they put a provisional credit of {$1000.00} in my bank account while they continued to investigate. Well, nobody ended up reaching out to me, and then they sent me another letter stating that that they were unable to retrieve the funds, they are closing my claim, and withdrawing the {$1000.00} provisional credit from my bank account in 3 business days, sorry for any inconvenience. While I was in total disbelief that this was their conclusion, I did some research and called them to appeal this decision. In my research I found that Wells Fargo is surprisingly a part owner of XXXX ( they really try to hide this ). Additionally, I found new directives to Regulation E in regards to the Federal Electronic Transfers Act were put out in XXXX and XXXX of 2021 by the Consumer Financial Protective Bureau, to address these exact scams and protect individuals like me. I also discovered that Wells Fargo and the XXXX XXXX  XXXX have inconsistently resolved these fraudulently transactions with their customers. Some have been reimbursed, but only usually after a news agency contacts them and exposes what they are doing. I dont understand why Wells Fargo is not adhering to the new directives that the Consumer Financial Protect Bureau put out in XXXX and XXXX of 2021. Furthermore, they were not even willing to extend the {$1000.00} provisional credit withdrawal for more than the 3 business day notice that I received. They said if the funds were not in the account, that they will overdraft my account into the negative, regardless of whatever automated electronic debits I have set up to pay my other creditors, and they did exactly that. I have been a Wells Fargo customer for 22 years, and I can not believe they are treating me like this. It is so unacceptable, especially because of the new directive changes to federal regulation E to address these exact fraudulent transactions. Moreover, their untimely handling of the this situation when it was unfolding certainly must have contributed in not being able to reverse this unauthorized transaction. I also feel that I was purposely informed not to file a police report to give them an advantage to not have to reimburse me. Also, the same mishandling goes for me never getting connected to, or having someone reach out to me ( like they said would happen ) to walk me thru what my next steps were suppose to be. Such as, taking screen shots of fraudulent text messages, phone calls and account transactions that would of demonstrated timelines for evidence, especially for a police report."
2534,"On XX/XX/2022 At approximately XXXX pm I get a call from ( XXXX ) XXXX which caller I.D . says Wells Fargo. The voice on the other line was a man who identified himself as Wells Fargo Fraud dept. He informed me that they flagged someone trying to send money from my account to another account using XXXX in the amount of {$3500.00}. In order to put funds back into your account you must login to your online banking and add myself to my XXXX account and wire the money to a XXXX XXXX. He explained that this will be the person handling my claim. Next he says I would receive a text from Wells Fargo a six digit code in which he will need to verify and authorize the transfer. He gave me the XXXX number to call if I hadn't heard from XXXX XXXX in a couple of days. This process went very fast because at XXXX pm I called the Wells Fargo Fraud Department and told them what just happened and the agent said I had just been scammed. 

He filed a claim, closed my old account, assigned me a new one and said since money left my account I should get that back. He said it would be about 5 to 10 working days for them to resolve this issue. 
XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I call Fraud Dept . and was put on hold for 46 min. and got frustrated and hung up! 
XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX pm I call fraud dept. asked this agent about my claim, she transfer me to another dept. and in the process I get disconnected! 
XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX to XXXX I call 9 different times because the wait was 30 minutes or more, I never spoke to anyone. People have things to do from day to day like work and take care of their families! 
XX/XX/XXXX starting at XXXX am I was left on hold for 21 minutes, XXXX am left on hold for 29 minutes, XXXX pm called twice and hung up when I find out the wait will be an excessive 30 min., XXXX pm on hold for 6 min. hung up the wait was another 30 min. 
XXXX XXXX at XXXX am waited 38 min. hung up, XXXX pm on hold for 14 min. hung up, XXXX pm waited 2 min. hung up the wait was 30 min. 

XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX am left on hold for 45 min. hung up, XXXX am on hold for 18 min, hung up, XX/XX/XXXX28 on hold for 7 min. hung up, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX pm on hold 2 min. hung up, XXXX am on hold 2 min. hung up, XXXX am Finally spoke to an agent he says the claim has been closed by the fraud dept. because they do not see it as fraud so they sent the case to another dept. and proceeds to tell me to call back again when someone that handles this type of case is working. He tells me the times to call between XXXX am to XXXX am Eastern time. I am beside myself with the lack of communication and the fact that I have to spend most of my days calling about my case. 

I check my mail at around XXXX am and find several letters from Wells Fargo dated for the XXXX and XXXX. The final letter states that the case has been closed in the online fraud dept. because they find that there was no fraud and they will send it to another dept. to investigate and that they would like to return my money but it is not guaranteed. If I have any questions please call ( XXXX ) XXXX so I call this person right of way and she gives me the fraud number to call which is the number I've been calling all along!!! This was the last straw I will look for legal help, close my accounts and go to a bank that has their priorities in order!"
2535,XX/XX/2021 at XXXX I received a called from a person claiming to be a Wells Fargo fraud specialist and detected unusual activity. During the call the person on the phone broke into my Wells Fargo online banking and initiated a wire transfer of {$9800.00}. I immediately went to the bank and told them someone is pretending to be me and to stop them. My pin and online account info was changed immediately. During that the time I received a call from an actual Wells Fargo wire transfer team asking me about this and verifying it was me. The bank teller told me not to answer my phone. I feel had I answered my phone I could have prevented this wire from being completed. I was also assured by different bankers that my money would be returned to me. The claim was eventually denied and this person that the bank has knowledge on is still on the streets.
2536,"Involved in scam with XXXX through Wells Fargo. Spoofed number called from sisters phone number stating that they had my sister at gunpoint and would kill her unless {$500.00} was transferred using XXXX. XXXX owns her own dental practice and this situation seemed all too real for a robbery, especially since the call was coming from her number. Money was sent due to fraud/scam and threat to life. Date of loss occurred XX/XX/XXXX. Caller stated their name was XXXX and used number on XXXX of XXXX. Immediately called and filed claim with XXXX XXXX and XXXX fraud/scam. Also filed police report and reported to FBI. Received denial of claim letter XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo refuses to refund {$500.00} even though this was clearly a scam/fraud and was reported within XXXX minutes of the occurrence."
2538,On XX/XX/XXXX my unemployment account was compromised and my direct deposit got changed to a individual that I don't know. Who account number I received from the originator. XXXX. I called wells Fargo since it was one of there accounts. They were not trying to help even after I got a hold of the account numbers. My money is being deposited into another person account and is causing me finicial harm. The customer service was very rude and will protect the fraud person. Saying they are the only bank that lets people deposit checks thats not in that persons name.
2541,"On XX/XX/21 I received an email from XXXX alerts saying my card was declined at XXXX PM at XXXX & XXXX landscaping. 

I called XXXX customer service at XXXX PM and spoke to an agent named XXXX. I spoke to him about the card decline email I received and the fraudulent XXXX transaction attempt that I got at XXXX PM text saying a {$3500.00} XXXX transfer was attempted and he confirmed that my account was compromised, so he would put a replacement on my card. He asked me to confirm my mailing address and I did. He asked if I had my card on hand or if I lost it somewhere. I told him that I did not lose my card and had it on hand, which is why I was confused about how someone could try to use it. 

The employee confirmed that there was suspicious activity and said he would close my card and send a new one. I asked what they might have access to and if I should change my online info and he recommended that I should and offered to do it with me on the phone. He said he would help me update my username and password over the phone. I proceeded to give him a very new and unique username over 6 times, but he continuously told me that no mam these arent available- which I find very hard to believe. After I attempted to try again with a new username the real XXXX employee abruptly hung up the phone at XXXX PM. It is highly unusual that this real Wells Fargo employee offered to update my username and password over the phone - even more so when he kept me on the line saying that these unique usernames were all taken, then to suddenly hang up while I was speaking. I attempted to call back at XXXX PM but I was unable to get a real person so I hung up. At XXXX PM I got a missed call back from Wells Fargo with the spoofed number ( XXXX ) XXXX -- I did not realize this was a spoofed number at the time, as the number matched Wells Fargo 's real number and I was waiting on a call back from the Wells Fargo agent because the last one hung up on me. 

The caller said his name was XXXX XXXX with the Wells Fargo Fraud department. He asked if I have recently been in IL or NC and I said no ( this is where XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is located, which further made me believe he was a real employee and saw the card attempt ). He said they were notified of fraudulent activities on my account and would help me secure my account by updating my username/password, as well as process the XXXX reversal. He said that he was going to help me set up my new username and psw but first he would take care of the fraudulent XXXX  transfer. He said although I cant see the XXXX  attempt in my bank activity it was pending in the system and he could view that it went through. 

He asked me to confirm my mailing address- which I did. Several times throughout our interaction he assured me my information was secure and that he understands my concerns. He said that because XXXX is a third party he would have to process the refund manually with me over the phone. He sent a verification number to my email and had me repeat it back to him. 

I asked why it said XXXX  XXXX XXXX and he said thats how the fraud department secures my account because the Wells Fargo account was compromised. He told me to confirm and add my email as a XXXX  contact to start the reversal process ( XXXX which I also thought would be the email linked/ associated with my XXXX account. He told me to add the new contact with the first initial of my first name and then the two beginning letters of my last name ( X Xx ). 

After I added my email address as a contact, the name XXXX appeared above my personal email. 

I asked why that name popped up and he proceeded to tell me that was the account manager 's name which I spoke to someone by the name of XXXX. I asked him to verify that he works with Wells Fargo and he told me that the number hes calling from should match the number on the back of my debit card- which it did. He walked me through the XXXX  steps and asked me to confirm the amount of money in my checkings account. I sent the payment and he said I will be receiving my new username and password link via email to secure my account. After we continued to question him he began to taunt me, laughing, saying "" gotcha '' etc. 

After this I immediately hung up and attempted to call back XXXX 3 times ( XXXX PM, XXXX PM, XXXX PM ) but I was unable to reach an operator. My mother called and we got in contact with XXXX in the fraud department. I provided her my last four ssn and she proceeded to explain that she cant file fraud bc I was the one who sent the money -- even though it was a person impersonating a XXXX employee just 6 minutes after we spoke with a real employee. She said that scammers are now able to spoof the XXXX number and it has been an ongoing problem that executives have been made aware of. She said a money movement claim resolution will be disclosed in 10 business days. I told her about the former employee XXXX hanging up and she proceeded to apologize and said Im not sure why. I asked if she could see if I actually have a card coming to me and she confirmed that the first person I talked to was a real employee, and that I do have a new card coming. 

I find it extremely alarming that just 6 minutes after I was speaking to a real agent, a scammer claiming to be with Wells Fargo with a spoofed Wells Fargo number called me ( as I was currently waiting on a call back from the real employee ). The XXXX  name that appeared above my email address was XXXX, which I find even more suspicious because that was the name of the real employee I spoke to. I also find it unsettling that after sending my replacement card, the real Wells Fargo employee offered to reset my username and password on the phone. I gave him multiple usernames and each time he would respond with sorry that is not available- which I dont believe is true. Any other time I spoke to an agent and needed my user/psw reset I would receive an email with a link to do so - not get baited by the employee to give a new user and psw to them over the phone. Then the phone call suddenly ended with him hanging up or disconnecting the call. The phone call with the scammer seemingly picked up where my first Wells Fargo call ended by starting with Hi my name is XXXX XXXX with the Wells Fargo fraud department, Im going to help you secure your account by updating your username and psw and also process the XXXX reversal for the fraudulent transaction. '' Thank you for your help with this matter"
2542,WELLS FARGO- owes us {$55.00} x 24 months Plus {$280.00} ( for annual PCI fees ) = {$1600.00} total.

Then they said we were being billed {$55.00} because we did not have a PCI compliance with them. We sent them a cancellation letter almost two years ago and we do have a PCI compliance with our new company. They will not give us our money back.

2547,On XX/XX/XXXX I fell victim to a scam and lost all of the money in my checking and savings account and made a max cash advance on a credit card. I called Wells Fargo immediately once I realized and the person who picked up claimed that they were filing numerous claims for me for each of the transactions that occurred due to the scam. I received an email saying that only one claim has been addressed and have heard absolutely nothing about the others. The one that they addressed was worth {$35.00} while all of the others combined equal {$2400.00}.

I was told the keys would be mailed to me. I had been corresponding through the scammer ( who I thought would be my landlord ) via text and e-mail. I followed his directions to make this cash deposit into the account number that he gave to me XXXX. A few hours later, my dad told me I had been scammed. I went back to the branch to explain the situation and they looked up the account number and told me that it had been flagged for fraud ; no money could enter or leave the account. The banker told me there were several other cash deposits made in the same amount into that same account from other locations. I filed a police report with the XXXX XXXX PD. For the past month I have been in correspondence with the Branch Manager. ( Wells Fargo Bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX ).

2552,"I had made two transfers of XXXX $ and XXXX $ Through XXXX and XXXX  using my checking and savings accounts on XXXX XXXX to put a security deposit on a single family home. It turned out to be a scam and I called Wells Fargo XX/XX/2021 as soon as I realized. I filed two claims for these two charges and was told that would be refunded. When I just called XX/XX/2021 to get an update on my claims, I was told they were not going to refund that money. I was on the phone with Wells Fargo for an hour being transferred every 5 minutes with not one person being able to come to a resolution. I also filed a police report to report the scam with my local authorities on XX/XX/XXXX. I also do have the case number if needed. This report also had an identity theft scam as well. In regards to the home that was being listed was also a homeowners legitimate home and the scammer was using his property and full name to "" rent '' me the property."
2555,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I used an online resale app to advertise dining furniture in XXXX XXXX. I am a student and because I was in financial peril due to the pandemic, I needed funds to pay upcoming school fees. I listed the furniture for {$500.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX user responded to listing saying he was interested in the furniture and would like to send money in advance to reserve the items. We shifted communication off the app to text message ( buyer 's number : XXXX ). XXXX He sent {$1000.00} via e-check ( attached below ) from his financial officer  XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and claimed the additional {$500.00} was to pay movers who would be picking up the furniture. I deposited the check via Wells Fargo mobile ( XXXX ) and confirmed the check was received into my bank account. The next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I received confirmation that the funds from the check were available in my account. At XXXX the buyer requested I pay the moving company ( {$500.00} ) via a zelle account XXXX belonging to a XXXX XXXX . XXXX is a payment option offered through WellsFargo 's online banking service so I was led to believe it was safe. Per are agreement, he was to tell me the pickup time and come get the furniture. After I sent the payment, the purchaser began taking more time to respond and sending sporadic texts. The movers never arrived for the furniture. At XXXX I messaged him for an update on pickup time and he said he was no longer able to get the furniture. He requested I return the remaining balance through XXXX XXXX, bitcoin or a XXXX wallet card to XXXX. I didnt feel comfortable using these methods as I had heard they were commonly used by scammers so I googled the owner on the e-check and it looked to be a shell company. I contacted my bank ( WellsFargo ) immediately and while on the phone with them, saw that the e-check Id deposited was being returned and my bank charged an additional {$12.00} for a counterfeit check. WellsFargo withdrew the funds from the bounced check on XX/XX/XXXX. I am now missing {$510.00} because of the money sent to the movers + the charge for the counterfeit check. While on the phone, the Wells Fargo Banker said that since the transaction happened through Wells-Fargo 's linked account to XXXX, they should be able to help me. She also recommended filing a police report as it would help my case. I filed the police report ( Report # XXXX ) that same evening. I have attached the counterfeit check as well as my text messages with the scammer to prove the check cleared initially. I also attached emails from the seller 's "" finance officer '' as well as WellsFargo when they received the check and when it later bounced. 

I contacted Wells Fargo again on XX/XX/XXXX to submit the police report and request an update. They said my claim was still processing and they would call me with an update. After not receiving said update I contacted them again on XXXX, but I was informed the claim was closed on Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX. They said they attempted to call me via phone but did not leave a voicemail. I have gone through my call history and email and have not received a single call from Wells Fargo or XXXX. The only calls I received that day were from my family and my phone was with me the entire time. I explained this to Wells Fargo and they said there is nothing they can do because it was a XXXX transaction. XXXX is not offering restitution either because they say it has to be addressed with my Bank. I have been contacting Wells Fargo since XXXX when I first filed the claim and they keep re-routing me through different departments only to not give me an answer or offer to reopen my account claim. All I want is to be able to pay my school fees and every representative I've spoken to has been callous towards my situation and unhelpful. I called Wells Fargo again for their XXXX Claims Dept number and they routed me through different departments only to drop the call 3 times. As of now I've been in contact with their bankers from Online  customer service, Debit Card Claims, ACH check claims. I finally got re-routed back to Online Customer Service on XXXX and they said there is no recourse and refused to escalate my claim. The banker 's reasoning was that that XXXX is valid considered a cash/ATM transaction so they can't help me. I am aware that I am at fault for falling for a scam but the transaction was made under the guise that the check the person sent was valid. I only sent the {$500.00} because I received an email from wellsfargo confirming receipt of the deposit and a notification from their app confirming the availability of the funds. It clearly wasn't a valid transaction given that I have explained the situation countless times and even went as far as to file a police report and inform all parties that it was fraudulent. Now no one from Wells Fargo is attempting to help me or offer recourse."

2560,"On XX/XX/2022 ( at XXXX XXXX ), someone called me from Wells Fargos customer service number XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX. The person said they represented Wells Fargo and was investigating fraudulent activity on my account. In sum, by using the same number as Wells Fargo 's Customer Service "" XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX '', by claiming to be an agent of Wells Fargo who was working on resolving/investigating the fraudulent activity on our account, this person was able to trick me into sharing my usemame and access codes. While I never gave the person my password, he was able to access and take over my account within minutes. I also believe the person also simultaneously called Wells Fargo, and was able to convincingly pose, as myself to Wells Fargo. This way, the person was able to trigger Wells Fargo to text access codes to my account while intercepting and misdirect any verbal messages communicated between myself and Wells Fargo discussing what the codes were actually for. The man took a {$19000.00} cash advance from my credit account, transferred it to my checking account, and then subsequently wired {$20000.00} to a person by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX ( at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank ) who I don't know, and conduct other smaller transactions. In sum, all available credit and any available money was drained from our accounts on XX/XX/2022. 

We call the Wells Fargo bank right away, ( w/i 30 minutes of the transactions being initiated ), and after being disconnected with the man who I though was Wells Fargo XXXX I was told that a fraud claim was opened on my account ( # XXXX ), and I would now need to verify my ID in person in a branch due to the flagged activity. At this time, I requested confirmation that all transactions from XX/XX/2022. But, Wells Fargo continued with the transactions anyway without waiting until I verified my ID in person like I was informed I must do. Likewise, I also later discovered Wells Fargo 's online fraud team left a message on my cell that fraudulent activity had been flagged while I was on the phone with the fraudster posing to be from Wells Fargo. 

After working with wells fargo non-stop since XX/XX/2022, their resolution was to reimburse all claims, except for the {$20000.00} wire transaction. Wells Fargo states based on the online access and other agreements the transactions I am responsible for the transactions because I provided the man information ( i.e. username and access codes ) regardless if the man gained the information fraudulently and the transaction weren't actually authorized by me ( or my wife ). 

Worse still, Wells Fargo made several errors in the investigations, and including also deducting {$19000.00} from our checking without reimbursing the money to our credit card. Specifically, in addition to the man stealing $ XXXX from our account, Wells Fargo took about an additional {$19000.00} from our account after concluding the {$19000.00} cash advance should be reimbursed. So, our account is now a negative balance and our credit card balance still remains maxed out."

2563,"From XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX i sent XXXX via Wells Fargo payments to a person who claimed to be looking for a roommate. I sent money to them under the impression i would be living there aswell. As soon as they recieved the full amount of money they didn't not give me a key to the place and refused me entering the property. There were multiple people involved in this scam. They also refused to give any of the funds back. I sent a total of XXXX to this person. Another company who has also been made aware of the issue is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX since they added my name to a rental agreement as an occupant even though i didn't not live there nor signed any official documents. They just accepted the payment. 


XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX only agreed to removing my name.from the rental agreement Wells Fargo has offered to investigate these transactions and filed a claim"
2565,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted by someone claiming to be XXXX XXXX a hiring from XXXX XXXX XXXX. They told me about a job offer and that we could schedule the interview over XXXX. We then had a text interview where I was eventually hired and told I would be receiving a check to pay for my work supplies. I received a check on XX/XX/XXXX totaling {$3400.00}. I was then told to deposit the check and send what was available which totaled {$400.00}. I then was left with a negative account balance. I filed a complaint and claims with Wells Fargo # XXXX and a reference number # XXXX. I also filed a police report, XXXX."
2569,"On XX/XX/21 I received a phone call from the Wells Fargo XXXX number from someone claiming to be a banking representative asking if I authorized several charges on my checking account. At the time my debit card had been misplaced so I believed someone had my card and was using it to make charges. The so-called banking representative said he would take care of it by having me accept the XXXX transfer he initiated, and those funds would then be put back into my account. At the same time, I received text messages asking if I had authorized those charges to which I replied no. He asked me to open my Wells Fargo app to approve the {$2000.00} XXXX transfer and when I questioned it, he said he was with the Wells Fargo office in XXXX XXXX and read off a badge number and reiterated that he called me from the XXXX Wells Fargo phone number. I've been banking with them for almost 30 years and know that is the phone number so that is why I trusted the legitimacy of the phone call and because my card at the time was missing. I approved the transfer and then immediately hung up because my friend entered my car at the time and told me it was a scam because the same thing happened to her a few weeks prior with XXXX XXXX XXXX. After I hung up, I called Wells Fargo back to ask if they had placed the call and talked to 2 different bankers that would not answer my question. At this point I thought my phone number had been flagged and did not trust the legitimacy of who I was speaking with, so I called Wells Fargo again from my friends phone number and was able to file a complaint. This all took place on XX/XX/XXXX and my complaint was filed within 1 hour of this happening. Since then, Wells Fargo has said they researched my complaint and there was nothing they can do to refund the {$2000.00} because I authorized the charges. I have gone into a branch to discuss the circumstances around what happened and was told it was escalated only to receive another letter telling me they were closing the case. I have called several times since and been told that they were turning the case over to management and someone would call me within 24 hours never to receive a phone call. Their stance is that I authorized the charges and I have no protection since it was a XXXX transaction. My friend who had the same thing happen was able to receive her funds back from XXXX XXXX XXXX within a few weeks. I don't see how it is possible that I have no protection from Wells Fargo. I have researched this scam online as well and know it has happened to other consumers in other cities and they have also been refunded their money. 

I work in media and have reached out to several media outlets to get help advocating for consumers about this scam and ultimately, get a refund from my financial partner who I have trusted with my bank accounts and mortgage for nearly 30 years. I have learned that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is owned by Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The XXXX app is linked to a persons bank account. While its true that the fine print says XXXX offers no protection, how is it reasonable that the banks who own XXXX take no responsibility when their app is repeatedly used to scam their own customers? In fact, despite knowing this is a widespread problem, they continue to encourage their customers via email and TV marketing to use XXXX, thereby perpetuating harm to customers who should be able to trust them. Just because something is legal doesnt make it ethical. If these banks had to stand behind the company they own, this app would have been either fixed or recalled long ago."
2570,"At XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call from what I believed to be Wells Fargo XXXX I called the Wells Fargo customer service department using the number listed on their website to verify I was being called from a legitimate number, and a Wells Fargo employee told me that the number was legitimate. 

I was told there was suspicious activity on my account and that they needed to confirm some information. They sent me a one-time-use passcode to my phone to confirm my identity. After relaying the passcode to them they told me that my account had been compromised, and that they would start a claim. They claimed due to the high call volume they would call me back, but that my account would be locked and I would not be able to log into it. 

They called me back several more times in regards to the supposed claim they were filing. During this time I grew suspicious as to whether or not this was in fact Wells Fargo. I called Wells Fargo directly using a number on their website ( number ), and confirmed I was being called by their fraud prevention number. I still felt suspicious, so at XXXX I called Wells Fargo directly and told them I believed that I may have been a victim of identity theft/fraudulent activity ; it was at this point where I began being perpetually transferred back and forth between different departments with long hold times. 

At the same time I was receiving emails of activity happening on my online account ; I tried logging in but was unable as it said my username did not exist. At this point I was using both mine and my boyfriend 's phone to try to get a hold of someone at Wells Fargo who would actually do something about what was happening. My longest phone call with Wells Fargo started at XXXX and lasted 108 minutes. I told someone about the emails I was receiving telling me that a recipient had been added to a wire transfer ( this was at XXXX ) I was transferred/put on hold. XXXX I received an email that I signed up for Wells Fargo Online Wires, still on hold. XXXX I received an email that a wire transfer in the total of {$10000.00} was being processed. Still on hold. While all this was happening I was also getting emails telling me that my card was also being used and that some purchases had failed while others succeeded. 

If any of the Wells Fargo Employees I spoke to over the course of the day had taken my problem seriously they could have easily stopped these transactions from happening. Their continued inaction allowed this fraudulent wire transfer to occur while I was on the phone with their fraud department. 

Over the next several days I spoke to at least 8 people from different departments from Wells Fargo. Again, every time I explained the situation I was sent somewhere else because "" Oh, that's wire transfer department '' or "" Oh, you need business accounts '' no one could give me a straight answer, or help in any way. I went into a branch the XXXX and spoke to someone. I was told I would have to wait to see what the investigator said, but based on what I'd told them and my timeline/phone calls they said it sounded promising that this would result in my favor. 

I received a letter dated XXXX - two days after the incident that my case had been denied ; that "" after reviewing all the information available to us regarding the disputed transactions, we've determined that the transaction was performed by you or someone who had your authorization '' They refused to acknowledge the timeline of events, and are refusing to let me speak to an investigator. 

I have attached the emails and their time stamps showing the activity on my account and my call log showing at the time of said events I was on the phone/on hold with Wells Fargo trying to stop the theft."
2571,"On XX/XX/2021 around XXXXXXXX XXXX EST, I received a phone call from someone posing as a Wells Fargo Bank representative. The person identified himself and called from the Wells Fargo customer service number ( XXXX ). The person informed me that someone in XXXX, Florida by the name of XXXX XXXX was trying to wire {$3500.00} via XXXX from my Wells Fargo debit card that ended in XXXX. The person told me I needed to log onto the Wells Fargo website. He informed me that the money in my account ( he knew the nickname on my bank account ) was froze. He told me I needed to wire {$3500.00} via XXXX back into my account. Initially I was unsure if the person was an actual Wells Fargo representative, but since he called from the Wells Fargo phone number, had my cell number, and knew the nickname on my bank account, I thought he was a real representative. In addition, I am unfamiliar with XXXX. So I followed his instructions and completed four transactions that totaled {$3500.00}. Unfortunately, I provided him the verification code I received via text message. After I completed the transactions, the person immediately hung up the phone. I immediately re-dial the number he called from, which was the number to Wells Fargo customer service. I spoke to a Wells Fargo representative and filed four claims. Just fyi, prior to this incident I lost my wallet at a restaurant in XXXX, VA. Therefore, I believe this person had my old debit card number and go access to my personal information and bank account information. The person sent me a message alert via text from XXXX. 

I received a status update from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2021. Wells Fargo informed me that the bank contacted XXXX to try to get refund on three of the four claims. Wells refuses to accept one of my complaints, although I did not knowingly nor intentionally transfer my money to scammer. Wells Fargo also informed me that the bank is at XXXX mercy and XXXX does not have a specific time frame ( and perhaps obligation ) to respond. 

This complaint is against Wells Fargo."
2572,"In good faith I sent a wire transfer from my XXXX XXXX  to a Wells Fargo account to pay a builder in Florida on Monday XX/XX/21. On Thursday XX/XX/21 my builder called to inquire about where was the wire transfer. I told him that I wired the funds to the new account at Wells Fargo sent to me by his office. He informed me that he did not have a new account at Wells Fargo. On closer inspection the email instructions with attachments were sent to me by an email address from his company and modified at the end by adding XXXX. I was sent a fraudulent email with fraudulent wire instructions to a Wells Fargo account. My Bank contacted Wells Fargo and they would not provide my bank with any information concerning the account due to "" privacy issues with their client ''. Each day the trail gets colder and Wells Fargo told my bank they would get back to them in 90 days.

It gave me a small slip telling me "" Sorry for the inconvenience '' and there had been a deposit of {$0.00} cents as a place holder until I made a claim and told them the amount I had deposited. I made a claim to Wells Fargo the next day and they told me because it was cash I might not get it back. They also told me I'd have to wait well over a week and a half. I will be evicted if I do not have that money soon.

2574,"I was seeking to rent an apartment on listed on XXXX and XXXX. I found an apartment that I like and requested more info through the sites. I was contacted via email by a person who identified as XXXX XXXX. The person claimed to be the owner of the property. He contacted me and advised that there were several people that inquired about the apartment and in order to hold the apartment for me, Id have to make a deposit, pay first months rent, and a {$300.00} cleaning fee all totaling to {$3200.00}. He advised me that he had a death in his family and was unable to show the apartment as hed be out of town attending a funeral. He also advised that I wire transfer the payment to the following ( via wire transfer ) : Full Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank name : XXXX XXXX Teacher 's XXXX XXXX Bank address. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NY XXXX Account number : XXXX Routing number : XXXX Type of account : Checking Reference No : XXXX I sent the payment of {$3200.00} to the person. He confirmed and acknowledged receipt. I also signed the lease electronically. 

I felt that this communication was suspicious when he later changed his narrative and advised that the apartment would not be viewed until the day before move in day ( scheduled for XX/XX/2022 ). I immediately requested a refund. The person stated that the refund can not be wired back to me and hed send me an overnight check in the mail. 

I received an email from the person on XX/XX/2022. He claimed that he advised his bank account XXXX to send me a check for my refund and send him a check for his traveling expenses. He claimed that the bank account officer mistakenly sent one check that included my refunded along with his traveling expenses. He requested that I deposit the check as soon as I receive it and collect my refund and immediately forward him the remaining balance of the check. 

I received a check the following day in the amount of {$10000.00}. It did not look legitimate. The check was from XXXX. I contacted XXXX to make sure it was legit. I was advised that they did not have the said claim number or draft number. The was a fake XXXX check. 

I contacted the person back via email and text stating : Good afternoon XXXX, I am in receipt of your email ; as well as the check. Please be advised that I have reported this check as a fraudulent check. This matter is currently under further investigation and legal action has been set forth. Thank you. 

I received no further response.

XXXX XXXX XXXX is stating that Wells Fargo refused to provide the funds back or freeze the funds even after Wells Fargo was informed that they were scam funds. As this is scam and the kitten was not shipped, Wells Fargo should have provided the funds back to XXXX XXXX XXXX or at least frozen them until such time as an investigation could be done. They were notified before I told the breeder I had figured out this was a scam and so the chance of recovery was lost when Wells Fargo declined to freeze or investigate. Due to Wells Fargos lack of action, the funds at this point will not be recoverable."

I called Wells Fargo immediately and reported the unauthorized transaction. They set up claim # XXXX and told me they will investigate what happened and asked what time of day I was available so that they could call me for questions. Wells Fargo never contacted me after this. I also had to ask Wells Fargo to change my user ID and password to prevent anymore theft from the hackers.

I ignored their calls and texts. I also filed a police report XXXX with officer XXXX of the XXXX XXXX, IA police department. Today I received an email from Wells Fargo stating that the payment was processed as requested. I did not request nor authorize this or do it myself. There was no request from me. The only people that requested it our the criminals that stole the funds. Regulation E states they must return my funds for this unauthorized withdrawal. XXXX even states this on their website. Wells Fargo is incorrect stating that I authorized people to steal from me. 

Wells Fargo 's response to my first complain was that the transaction was an XXXX sale. 
What sale? What was purchased? Where is the information from XXXX? I have no information about any transaction sale with XXXX. I don't think it is even possible to pay with XXXX on XXXX. They only offer XXXX and credit cards. What does this have to do with them gaining access to my wells fargo account? A XXXX transfer to XXXX XXXX was done directly through my Wells Fargo bank account. There was no involvement by XXXX. XXXX was the email my money was sent to. That is not XXXX.

On XX/XX/2021, a wire transfer in the amount of {$26000.00} was debited from the deposit account ending in XXXX and sent to the beneficiary XXXX XXXX. On the same business day, a {$30.00} wire transfer fee was assessed.

As a result, claim number XXXX was opened on your behalf in effort to recover the funds on your behalf. On XX/XX/2021, after receiving your fraud statement, XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX made a recall request to the beneficiary bank Wells Fargo to return the funds. On XX/XX/2021, as a courtesy, a second recall request was made to Wells Fargo as they never responded to the initial request to return the funds. Wire transfers are considered guaranteed funds. Once a wire has been sent and the initiator attempts to recall it, the approval of the recipient is required to have the wired funds returned. Without this approval, a recall can not be completed. Our Deposit Agreement and Disclosures publication ( the Agreement ), which forms part of the contract between our clients and the bank, states that clients may not amend or cancel a payment order after we receive it. If you ask us to do this, we may make a reasonable effort to act on your request. However, we are not liable to you if, for any reason, a payment order is not amended or canceled. Please refer to the section titled Amending or Canceling Payment Orders for further information. The Agreement is available to all clients on our website at bankofamerica.com/deposits/resources/deposit-agreements.go. On XX/XX/2021, claim number XXXX was denied, as we made multiple attempts to recover the funds and we have not received a response from the beneficiary bank Wells Fargo XXXX After reviewing the circumstances of the wire, we have concluded that XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX handled the wire in accordance with the law that governs payment orders by crediting the account bearing number that we were directed to credit. In order to debit the funds from an account that was not deposited in error by the bank, we must receive a debit authorization from that account owner. While we are sensitive to the effect this matter has had on you, our review has not identified any bank error in the handling of the wire transfer. As a result, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX respectfully declines your request to return the funds in the amount of {$26000.00}. We regret learning that you may have been the victim of a scam. Although no one expects to be victimized, it is important for consumers to be aware of the circumstances under which they transact business. We recommend that you file a police report if you have not already done so. We encourage you to continue to work with law enforcement to recover any losses from the transaction. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX will fully cooperate with any law enforcement agency if we are contacted about a fraud investigation. XXXX XXXX, thank you for sharing the details of your experience. We regret any inconvenience you may have encountered as a result of this matter and apologize for any service provided that did not meet your expectations."
2589,"At the beginning of XXXX, I applied for a checking and savings account with Wells Fargo. 

On XX/XX/2021, I received an email stating my accounts have been approved and welcoming me to Wells Fargo. 

On XX/XX/2021, I received an email from Wells Fargo for each account, stating that they have made a business decision to close each of the XXXX accounts. 

Unfortunately for me, this was after my XXXX funding transfer from my previous bank ( XXXX ) had already been withdrawn from my account and my old accounts closed. 

After trying to work with XXXX and Wells Fargo, both have been unable to help me get my {$360.00} back. 

XXXX says Wells Fargo has withdrawn it and should have it ; Wells Fargo says it should have been returned to XXXX when the accounts were closed. The XXXX case number was XXXX. The XXXX case number was : XXXX. 

The money never credited to either of the new accounts ; the {$330.00} to the new XXXX savings and {$25.00} to the new XXXX checking."

The representative told me a hold had been put in place and ended the call. 2 days later on XX/XX/XXXX {$5000.00} is transferred out of my account into XXXX by the fraudster. I contacted Wells Fargo again on XX/XX/XXXX regarding the hold and was told a hold was never put in place. When seeking resolution from Wells Fargo I was told through a letter that a hold takes 3 days to be put in place. I have requested to speak to a manager several times but none have ever gotten back to me in order to explain why the request for a hold I made on XX/XX/XXXX was never put in place and why I was never read a disclaimer informing me that it would take 3 days for a hold to be put in place but was instead told it had already been done. Any request for review of or copy of the original XX/XX/XXXX phone call has been ignored even after contacting the XXXX.

I told them that I had not, and requested that the wire transfer be stopped and/or reversed immediately. 
Mr. XXXX asked for my online account password and Social Security number. I provided the former but not the later. He texted me several security codes to my cell phone and asked me to confirm them, which I did. 
Several hours after the above conversation, I received emails from Wells Fargo documenting each of the unauthorized actions Mr. XXXX reported : Tuesday, XX/XX/2021, XXXX XXXX  EDT : Your Transfer is Being Processed - {$7000.00} from savings account ( XXXX ) to checking account ( XXXX ) Tuesday, XX/XX/2021, XXXX XXXX  EDT : You signed up for Wells Fargo Online Wires Tuesday, XX/XX/2021, XXXX XXXX EDT : Your Wire Transfer Recipient has been added ( XXXX XXXX ) Tuesday, XX/XX/2021, XXXX XXXX  EDT : Your Wire Transfer is Being Processed - {$23000.00} moved to account XXXX from my checking account XXXX.

On XX/XX/2021, I called Wells Fargos Online Claim Office ( XXXX ) and was told that a fraudulent transfer claim had been initiated on XX/XX/2021, but they were unable to provide any information. On XX/XX/2021 Wells Fargo sent an unsigned letter to me denying my claim ( # XXXX ), asserting that after investigation weve determined that the transaction was performed by you or someone who had your authorization. A copy of that letter is enclosed. On XX/XX/2021 I called the Wells Fargos Online Claim Office ( XXXX ) and spoke with an agent named XXXX. I asked why my claim was denied. He provided the following information : XXXX said according to the notes in my claim record the claim was denied because the beneficiary bank had not responded to Wells Fargos request to return funds. Note that my letter from Wells Fargo ( attached ) states the beneficiary bank did respond to Wells Fargo saying there were no funds available to return. 
XXXX said he would re-request that Wells Fargo contact the beneficiary bank. I requested that I be informed of any outcome. 
XXXX indicated there was no record of Wells Fargo attempting to obtain the computer IP address from where the bank transactions were made. 

I believe Wells Fargo was negligent in their investigation and they should re-credit my account in the amount of {$23000.00}."

This wire transfer was supposed to be credited into my trading account with XXXX XXXX, to cover a margin call. My money was not transferred till end of day and when I called Wells Fargo for status, they stated that wire transfer can take 3-5 business days. I even spoke to a supervisor who repeated the same thing. I reminded them this is not a ACH or online transfer and is wire transfer and also pointed them to bank policy. After waiting for over 32 minutes, my call was hung up on and bank never contacted me back or returned my wire fee or money. 

I have attached screen shots showing : 1. Wire transfer confirmation at XXXX XXXX 2. Phone screen shot with times and waiting time of 32+ minutes. After this, I was hung up on. This should be in the Wells Fargo 's call logs. 
3. XXXX shot showing wire transfer policy."
2600,"The name and account number listed in my text is not mine. 


On XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX  eastern, I got a call saying I won a major prize to call XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX eastern time, I called the toll free number and the recording said XXXX XXXX and I selected option 2 for suspected fraud. I used this option because someone I don't know named XXXX XXXX has been giving my phone number out as if it's her own. 

Spoke with XXXX XXXX his cell phone is XXXX and said his badge # is XXXX, he saw a name of XXXX XXXX and saw my name and my submissions. Told me I just won {$18.00} XXXX, {$500000.00} of this will be in cash the other in cashiers check. Plus {$10000.00} a week for life and a XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  car. On XX/XX/XXXX, I first went to my bank and withdrew {$3700.00}. Then, I went to Wells Fargo and sent a direct deposit to XXXX XXXX, checking account number XXXX, XXXX, FL XXXX. XXXX assured me this is tax for the car which will be repaid to me when the car is delivered with the prize patrol. He named XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and added XXXX XXXX. 

Later in the day, he says the verification process couldn't be completed on XX/XX/XXXX for delivery that day. Also said, someone from the "" main office '' would call me in a few minutes. I then got a call from XXXX XXXX saying my confirmation number was XXXX. I then gave it to XXXX, and later that day said all is verified the prizes will be delivered XX/XX/XXXX. He also asked if I had over {$5000.00} in a checking/saving account. I told him I didn't know and asked why he wanted to know. He then said in case their check bounces which puzzled me. My understanding was cashier checks are guaranteed funds. Lastly, he stated they will leave XXXX XXXX  and arrive around XXXX on Monday XX/XX/XXXX. When he gave me his cell number on XX/XX/XXXX he gave me the local main office number as XXXX. 

Please note, on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX, a police officer came to my door around XXXX  A call was received ( name withheld ) to say I might be a fraud victim. I told him at that time I was still unsure. He said if the person delays the prize to contact you. Today, I called him ( XXXX ) around XXXX XXXX and asked can I get cash in lieu of the car? He said yes, theyll hold the car and give me a waiver to sign so Ill get {$55000.00} for it. He said he was waiting on corp confirmation and called me back an hour later. He then came up with a clearly bogus reason for {$8800.00}. I said, what if I dont have it? He said Id have to go thru government approval for a sponsor and that will delay the prize. I said, I just gave you {$3700.00} and you want more for GOLD STAMP approval? I told him that doesnt sound reasonable. Then the call went silent and was dropped. Per XXXX XXXX XXXX/I immediately called XXXX fraud department at For Sweepstakes Scams misusing the XXXX XXXX XXXX name call : XXXX and spoke to XXXX. She filled her report, linking to FTC and police nationwide database and said to call local police. Since there was already a report filed, I emailed the chief of police on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I met with Wells Fargo who filed a report about this situation. On XX/XX/XXXX I met with XXXX who said we can only wait to see if the stop payment is timely. On XX/XX/XXXX Detective XXXX of XXXX Police gave me case number XXXX. Since then, they have not been able to have Wells Fargo release/ refund me the money. On XX/XX/XXXX my bank XXXX said the check cleared prior to my stop payment. Ive exhausted all known methods for a refund."
2601,"On XXXX XXXX I became the victim of a complex and elaborate fraud scheme. 

The details are as follows : At XXXX XXXX  mountain time, I received a Wells Fargo Fraud Alert text message. The message asked me if I had attempted a payment at XXXX # XXXX in the amount of {$100.00} and to respond with YES or NO. I did not authorize this transaction so I answered NO. Within minutes I received a telephone call from an individual. The caller ID said that the call was coming from Wells Fargo Customer Service at XXXX. I verified that this is the actual telephone number of Wells Fargo Customer Service. I asked the individual which of my two Wells Fargo checking accounts the transaction had occurred on and he gave me my COMPLETE and VALID Wells Fargo Checking account number. He told me that a number of wires had been performed on the account and asked me if I had done any wire transfers. I advised him that I hadnt. He told me that he would cancel them but he first needed to verify me by sending me an authorization code. He said that I would need to log in to online banking and enter the code. I signed on to online banking and told him that it didnt ask for the code so he just told me to give it to him. At that point he said he would cancel the wire transfers that had been performed. He said that I would be receiving a separate reference number for each cancelled transfer. I got several reference numbers. He then came back to the phone and said that he had successfully stopped all of the transfers. I had to leave for an appointment so that is where the conversation ended. During my appointment, I became suspicious and contacted Wells Fargo Customer Service. My phone records show that I made this call at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I feel that this contact is more than timely. I was advised that the funds in my deposit accounts had been concentrated to a single account along with the entire amount available on my line of credit. They advised me that {$19000.00} had been transferred by wire transfer to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX At that time I was told that they would attempt to recall the wire and would advise me. About 10 days later I was notified that the wire could not be recalled and that I had lost all of my money. I have discussed this decision with several people at Wells Fargo but have been told that this decision is final. 

I feel that Wells Fargo should never have allowed this wire to be completed. If they had Implemented the proper controls and had exercised proper due diligence, they would have discovered that the transactions performed on my account by the perpetrators were totally out of character for my account. 

This is evidenced by the following. 

In the entire 45+ years that I have been a customer of Wells Fargo and its predecessor banks, I have never performed even a single wire transfer .In the entire history of my accounts I have never done transfers between accounts in the numbers and for the amounts of those made to concentrate my funds as part of this fraud. I have never used my line of credit. In fact, I was notified by Wells Fargo that this product was being discontinued and the account would be closed. Additionally, this account does not appear on my online banking screen. How were the perpetrators able to access it?"
2602,"While abroad in XXXX, on XX/XX/2021, I received a text message from XXXX at Wells Fargo Bank Alarm Fraud Detection. I returned the call on XX/XX/2021 due to the time difference and was told that there was suspicious activity on my business accounts that needed to be verified. 
I was informed that someone had accessed my online banking accounts, transferred {$59000.00} from my various accounts into my Accounts Payable account, created online Payees and then paid themselves all the funds from my accounts. I confirmed that these transfers were not made by me, explained that I was in XXXX and that I had not done any on-line banking transfers. I also explained that I was alone and that no one had access to my device or my passwords. I was told that Wells Fargo had put a hard hold on my accounts due to "" suspected fraudulent activity inconsistent with my usual business banking ''. Because of this, I had no access to see what had happened or who did it. 
The Wells Fargo Rep gave me the names of the Payees and I verified that I did not know these people, or have invoices or contracts with any of them. The amounts total {$59000.00}. 
I filed a Fraud Claim with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2021 and was told to wait 10 days while it was investigated. 
On XX/XX/2021, I called Wells Fargo Claim department to find the status of the report and when I might expect the return of my funds and have the Hold taken off the access to my accounts. I was told that my claim was denied because they said the transactions happened from my device on my secure online access. I explained that I was alone and I had my device with me. There is no one who has my passwords. I stated clearly that I did not make these transfers and I do not know the people who were paid. I asked them to review my accounts to see that in my long-time banking with Well Fargo, I have never paid anyone the kinds of amounts that were paid out the days the fraudulent payments were made. These payments are in fact, "" suspected fraudulent activity inconsistent with my usual business banking ''. I faxed a rebuttal to the fraud claim department for the "" denied claim '' to explain that I was a victim of theft by some kind of online hacker or internet fraud. I spoke with both customer service and someone at customer advocacy. I was told that there was nothing they could do. They said they were sorry for my loss and any inconvenience, but it happens all the time. The Consumer Advocate suggested that if I was unhappy with Wells Fargos decision that implied that I committed the fraudulent transfers myself, I could file a police report and submit further documents. I did. I faxed the details, ( which included proving that I was actually in XXXX because it was suggested that I should offer proof ) to the Fraud Dept. and I also reported the theft of {$59000.00}, transferred by online banking to people I do not know in a Crime Report to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, in California. 
These transfers are criminal and I am victim of these events. It is hard to imagine that Wells Fargo would contact me to say fraud was happening on my accounts and then blame me for the fraudulent activity. I want to be very clear : I DID NOT TRANSFER ALL MY FUNDS TO UNKNOWN PAYEES. A crime has been committed, and Wells Fargo has shifted the blame to me."
2604,Entered wrong account number for wire transfer. Immediately called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2021 to initiate dispute and pull the funds back. Received claim number called today XX/XX/2021 to follow up. I was transferred XXXX trying to get someone to assist with the claim. Nobody will take accountability on who is responsible for handing the dispute.
2605,"On XX/XX/XXXX I initiated a XXXX transfer from my Wells Fargo account for goods and services to another XXXX member using their provided email address. Because I was using XXXX directly from my Wells Fargo app I assumed they would provide some sort of buyer protection for members using the service to complete legal and normal purchases and transactions. 
Wells Fargo includes the XXXX service directly from their website and app but is unwilling to reimburse banking members for money lost due to scams or unrecoverable goods."
2609,"On XX/XX/21, the same day my grandmother died, there were two {$140.00}, one {$500.00}, and two {$80.00} ATM withdrawals taken out of my account. When this happened I received a phone call from a person pretending to be from Wells Fargo. The man told me my account was hacked, and wanted to sign me up for a new secure service through Wells Fargo, where at that exact time I gave him my information, the money was taken out of my account. Most of this money was apart of a federal grant from XXXX for my education. These withdrawals happened at XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX in XXXX XXXX CA at an ATM with the ID XXXX when I was at my home in Northern, CA, nearly 10 hours north. These withdrawals were fraudulent and I was scammed. I am a struggling XXXX  XXXX  and I expressed all of this to Wells Fargo, where I filed a claim about these fraudulent charges. At the same time I also filed a police report with the XXXX County Sheriffs department. Wells Fargo denied my claim, even though the sheriff department classified the case as fraudulent, because I authorized the charges on my phone. I did not know what was happening when I received the scam phone call, my grandmother died on that day, I have the death certificate, and I did not understand what I was authorizing. I also received {$410.00} in overdraft charges, which I had to pay, even though I did not make the transactions that caused the overdraft fee. Wells Fargo told me that I originally would not have to pay those, but in the end I did. I have been completely scammed out off nearly {$1300.00}, and that is a lot of money for a broke XXXX  XXXX."
2610,"XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I payed XXXX $ for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX but didnt get it. I made a police Report in XXXX to get a fraud service at XXXX XXXX  in XXXX. XXXX XXXX  took contact with Wells Fargo bank to get result. Wells Fargo bank did not get me any result of : ar the account correct for the seller, are the money still on the sellers account, has he money on the account."
2611,"On XXXX I received a call from Wells Fargo stating that someone in Texas tried to use my debit card info to buy {$650.00} worth of things on XXXX and they stopped it but did not stop a {$1000.00} transaction made with XXXX, they proceeded to tell me the steps to reverse the funds by going into my Wells Fargo app and going to XXXX to refund the money, "" note I have never used XXXX before and did not know what it done '' they then told me to put my email address in and the amount that the people took and write refund so they knew it was a refund I did so and then immediately knew I just got scammed for real, they lady I talked to used wells fargos phone number and lingo and stole money from me, I immediately called wells fargo and they said there's nothing they can do I have exhausted all resources to get my money back. Wells Fargo has been disrespectful the entire time and won't give me any answers"
2613,"On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo defrauded me for {$3500.00}. I was heading to my doctor 's appointment and received a text at XXXXXXXX XXXX from Wells Fargo, identical to all alert text messages sent to my cell phone. It stated, "" Did you attempt a XXXX payment for the amount of {$3500.00}? Reply YES or NO or XXXX to STOP Fraud Alerts. I was driving and unable to respond to the message. At XXXX XXXX I received another text message from the Wells Fargo text alert, "" An Online Fraud Representative will be giving you a call shortly REPLY 1 To Proceeds With Placing The Call. At XXXXXXXX XXXX, a representative from Wells Fargo, using the following # - XXXX, My appointment was at XXXX XXXX, and being pressed for time. So I pulled over and went to my online banking for Wells Fargo under Menu and to the Security Center to double-check the number. It was one of several Wells Fargo numbers used for identifying reporting Fraud. Being short on time, I followed the instructions of the Wells Fargo employee on obtaining a refund for {$3500.00}. After ensuring it was a Wells Fargo number, I followed the instructions provided by the Wells Fargo representative. Finally, I went to my doctor 's appointment assured that Wells Fargo Bank is working to refund {$3500.00}. 

I was not feeling well after the doctor 's appointment and checked back online for a refund. After not receiving a refund, I contacted Wells Fargo Bank on XX/XX/XXXX using the same XXXX and spent an hour on hold. Finally, I advised the Wells Fargo representative of the situation and that Wells Fargo Representative defrauded me out of {$3500.00}. The representative on a recorded line advised me this was not the first call he had received with the same Fraud issue. I believe he said I was the sixth call about XXXX. That was concerning because I had not received any texts or e-mails alerting me of XXXX Fraud. 

I asked the following questions of the Wells Fargo Fraud Specialist 1. How did they contact me and know I was a Wells Fargo customer? They were unsure how they got my number and knew I was a Wells Fargo customer 2. How is a Wells Fargo number being used? The representative was surprised when I read the number back to them, and it was a Wells Fargo number. The representative expressed how the Fraudsters were getting more sophisticated.

3. How was an ordinary person without Fraud/Security knowledge to know the alerts and number representing Wells Fargo was a fraud? 
The reply was it was difficult because they were XXXX  a Wells Fargo number and using legitimate Wells Fargo alert text messages. I asked how Wells Fargo is not protecting their text messages and numbers? There was not a response to this question. 

After being shuffled around to various departments, I was able to get a fraud case opened for {$3500.00}. I sent the documentation showing the text messages and my call log showing the Wells Fargo incoming call using a verifiable Wells Fargo Number to the report phishing e-mail address as advised by the Fraud Representative. I took security a step further by ordering a new atm card, added a security question to my online account, and reviewed all of my XXXX contacts and transactions. I ended the call expecting a refund of {$3500.00} to my account. Still concerned, I contacted Wells Fargo again on XX/XX/XXXX, asking how could the Fraudster know my Wells Fargo information. The representative advised that the case was not entered correctly during that conversation, and I had ( 2 ) new cases numbers. I asked about the documentation I used with the old case number they assured me it was all moved to the new file. After being misled to believe it was still a Fraud case opened incorrectly. I did not know until I received the letter there was a difference. 
The representative then explained that Wells Fargo would investigate and get back to me in 10 days with an outcome, but still did not provide a difference in policy or that it was not a Fraud case anymore. 
I received a lackluster letter explaining how Wells Fargo ( paraphrasing ) could not reverse the funds and advised XXXX and submitted a request to the receiving Financial Institution to have the funds returned ; however, there was no guarantee of the return of the funds. Therefore, my claim was closed at this time. However, that is a misrepresentation because Wells Fargo and the receiving Financial institution was not intending on refunded the {$3500.00}. Then the letter was a standard letter where someone changed the date. It ended with a bunch of double talk about how I could obtain a copy of the research and further questions and get a copy of the documentation. 
I contacted Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX and connected with XXXX. He contradicted the letter by saying the receiving institution was not returning the funds defrauded by a Wells Fargo representative ( recorded line ). I asked about the steps taken to refund the {$3500.00} and, then he advised me of Wells Fargo Policy. I questioned the representative on the last update to the XXXX online and how was I notified about the new update? Did Wells Fargo send me an e-mail, text message, a document in the mail? XXXX shared how Wells Fargo advised him of the policy update. I reiterated how Wells Fargo notified me of the updated policy change. Unfortunately, XXXX was not able to answer that question. 
Next, I asked for all the research and documentation regarding my claim. What was insulting XXXX told me it would take XXXX calendar days to receive the research documentation regarding the fraud claim ; it took ten days to investigate, conclude no refund, and the claim closed. Not one of the previous representatives from Wells Fargo mentioned the policy on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and I believe XXXX. XXXX explained that he was not involved with that department and could not explain the lengthy timeline. I told XXXX, per my understanding, I was not the only Wells Fargo customer that this happened to, and Well Fargo retained the same number, and there was not an update to the message alerts. The letter did not even share how Wells Fargo is addressing the issue. 
My next question to XXXX was who was in charge of Wells Fargo Bank to file a formal complaint. XXXX advised he did not know but could get me to an Escalation manager who would address all my questions regarding my fraud on my account. 
Next, I talked with XXXX, the Escalation Manager, at XXXXXXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX on a recorded line. I asked her the same questions I asked XXXX. How am I notified about the XXXX updated process? XXXX proceeded to tell me how Wells Fargo advised her as a customer. I explained it was great she shared her experience, but how did Wells Fargo inform me. XXXX could not tell me how Wells Fargo notified me of the XXXX policies changes. I asked her who I could contact about filing a formal complaint against Wells Fargo ; again, she did not know. XXXX advised I could reach out to the Wells Fargo Board. I explained my confusion. XXXX told me the escalation manager  would address my questions regarding my fraud claim. Everything I asked, XXXX she did not have the answer. When I asked her about removing XXXX from my account, her advice was to go online, and I would find that information. I had to probe further to get an answer on removing XXXX from my account. 
Most importantly, I asked, XXXX how as an ordinary person would I be able to tell it was not Wells Fargo contacting me through message alerts and a Wells Fargo telephone number. I appreciated her honesty when she stated, "" I would not know she's trained to spot fraud, and as an ordinary person with text messages alert and actual Wells Fargo telephone number, I would not know. Then, realizing XXXX could not answer any of the questions regarding my fraud claim, I asked for a copy of all of the transcripts from my calls with Wells Fargo ; again, she did not know how to provide me with this information or how I could obtain these copies. 
XXXX could open a complaint with the Executive Office to provide answers and further assist me regarding my fraud claim, and someone would reach out to me within two days. I confirmed with XXXX, no later than XX/XX/XXXX, I would receive an e-mail Complaint # XXXX. 
I have stood by Wells Fargo through all the issues with fraudulent practice against their customers and because I felt this is one bank that will do right by their customers. To find out that XXXX banks, including Wells Fargo, call it scam vs. fraud because there are no laws, processes, or policies set up to ensure the security of their customers. I used XXXX because it is on my Wells Fargo site and trustworthy. After doing some research discovered what happened to me was not an isolated incident. 

I asked the board to reverse the decision made and return the {$3500.00} that Wells Fargo defrauded ; it was a deliberate misrepresentation that caused me to suffer damages in the form of a loss of money. The representatives and escalation manager I spoke to all agreed an ordinary person like myself would not have known it wasn't Wells Fargo. Due to this incident, I have lost trust in all forms of communication by Wells Fargo and Wells Fargo because the number that was compromised and used to defraud me is still on the website. The text messaging alerts have not changed. I tested it by sending money on separate occasions to see if Wells Fargo attempted to help their customers. What would have been helpful in the standard letter sent to me denying the return of my money is to offer advice on how Wells Fargo would protect this from happening in the future and how I could appeal this decision. 
Nor did this letter point me to the policies and procedures used to make this decision or the latest updated XXXX policy with Wells Fargo. I had asked how to find this information. When was I notified, and none of the Wells Fargo representatives could tell me how to find this information or inform me of any changes. It is my fault, and by Wells Fargo interchanging the word Scam for Fraud, my money is at the mercy or discretion of the Banks who know what is happening. Still, by using scam, my money is no longer covered by Fraud rules and governance afforded to me under Fraud laws. 
I also want the board to provide me with a copy of all the research sets and documented measures Wells Fargo took to return my money and the transcripts from each of the conversations I had with the Wells Fargo representatives, including the escalation manager. I want to know why Wells Fargo can not use Chargeback or the Electronic Funds Transfer file - Regulation E ( I was induced by a WELLS FARGO representative ) in my case it is appropriate to use it. I would appreciate a copy of XXXX and Wells Fargo 's most current policies ( per the representative is XXXX of XXXX ). Finally, I want to know Wells Fargo 's steps to educate their customer. I advised the initial representative that they had received at least six other calls for the same concern and fraud. 

An ordinary person uses fraud and scams to have the same meaning. Wells Fargo, at a minimum, should educate their customers about the difference and train their representatives on the location of pertinent information about policies and notification dates. At the very least, show concern for your customers by adding a pop-up alert so when customers open an online app advising about the FRAUD, hang up and contact Wells Fargo and send out a TEXT Alert and identify the Wells Fargo numbers used. 

More importantly, I was induced to XXXX my funds by WELLS FARGO- This falls under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act - Regulation E. Please see the attached documents showing the Wells Fargo Text and call log showing an active number still being used by WELLS FARGO. What is confusing some people get their money back and others don't? How is that not discrimination what are these people submitting her sending into Wells Fargo and their claim is approved and money refunded?"
2614,"I sent a wire transfer over on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX to purchase a house. XXXX XXXX the real estate agent and she works for XXXX XXXX.

Yes but XXXX XXXX XXXX is different. XXXX would have to mail it like she did the {$10000.00} down payment I gave her in a cashier 's check for the deposit.

2615,"I was mailing a check to the XXXX XXXX, I put it in the mail box on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I checked my balance on the 1st. and found out that someone has cashed it with the amount of XXXX XXXX The mail box was broken into."
2616,"While we were out of town at a wedding, we had an issue with our HVAC. The condenser in the attic flooded the office and guest bathroom and hallway. 

Luckily, we were insured by XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  # XXXX. There are mediation specialist told us there was at least {$10000.00} worth of damage, unfortunately after our {$2000.00} deductible, we were issued a check for {$1600.00} ( after over a month, with ceilings ripped out and insulation blowing around ).

Honestly, we were just thrilled to get anything so we could afford to make the house habitable again. I belong to XXXX  XXXX  XXXX XXXX, and they somehow manage to hold off the checks I deposit for 10 days, business days. 

As the check was written on Wells Fargo, I went there to cash it on XX/XX/XXXX. They refused. In the interest of full disclosure, the check was written out to my partner and I, who are co-owners of the house. The teller told me I would have to come back in on Monday with my partner. I suspect if we were a straight couple, it wouldve been less of an issue. 

Nevertheless, on Monday XX/XX/XXXX, my partner and I arranged for lunch times to go over to Wells Fargo. They again refused to cash the check that was drawn on them!!! 

They went on to tell us that even if they were willing to cash it, there would be a XXXX dollar check cashing fee. When did banks XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX hold our money hostage? 

There is nothing about the situation that I am OK with. If I couldnt cash the check, which the teller had on Saturday, she should not have told me I had to come in on Monday with my partner. And when my partner and I went into cash the check, they shouldve cashed it. Also the insurance company pays for that account, they should not be extorting more money out of me."
2617,"My daughter and I have a joint account in XXXX with XXXX. She requested a transfer of XXXX euros at a XXXX XXXX branch location to my account at XXXX XXXX XXXX  in the United States. After a couple days I went to a XXXX branch location to inquire if my money was transferred. I was told at the XXXX XXXX  that they had rejected the transfer ( without notifying me first ) because my account was dormant ( they had not notified me that my account was dormant ). My daughter went to the XXXX bank in XXXX again and asked where the money was and was told by XXXX that they would automatically try to transfer the money again even if it was rejected the first time. If unsuccessful, they would return the money to the original account. After I still did not receive the money a week later, my daighter for the 3rd time asked at a XXXX branch where the money was. She was told that the money is currently at an intermediate bank in the U.S, ( Wells Fargo ) and the transit was in progress. Money was sent by XXXX on XX/XX/2021, today is XX/XX/2021. I have still not received an answer from XXXX or Wells Fargo about where the money is and when I will receive it."
2620,"I was scammed out of {$12000.00} from a man/company that promised me {$50000.00} after an initial {$3000.00} fee that I needed to pay. I was told it was a US Customs fee. I was informed by them that because I took long, that fee was up to {$15000.00}. I cashed out three checks totaling {$12000.00} through Wells Fargo. I checks were in increments of {$3500.00} ( XXXX ), {$5000.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and {$4000.00} ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I realized it was a scam on XX/XX/XXXX, did not send anymore money, and contacted the bank immediately to report the scam. They informed me that they were not able to return me the money because it was removed from the account. They did not assist me any further."
2621,"I received a letter from Wells Fargo informing me of unclaimed property ( on or around XX/XX/2021 ). In this letter, WF states that I have 30 days to collect the funds from them, or else it will be sent to the state of MN unclaimed property division. I have spent the last month + trying everything to collect this property ( a cashiers check ) from Wells Fargo, who seems to be choosing to not staff their unclaimed property department. Efforts include, calling number as directed to on letter ( no one staffs it ), emailing ( no one responds ), calls to executive complaint department ( lots of promises, followed by ignoring calls/attempts to reach out ), and visiting a branch with passport and drivers license ( to verify my identity ), all efforts seem to be ignored or super slow walked by Wells Fargo.

Attaching a photo of the initial letter to me, as well as screenshots and emails showing that Wells Fargo is ignoring my requests. I Simply want what is mine, and am unsure how to collect it at this point. If you call the number in the initial notiffying letter, you will encounter a pre-recorded message that states that they are not staffing this phone line, and directs callers to email ( that was sent over a month ago, still unanswered ). I have spoken to numerous case managers and executives, each one passes me to the next and starts the process over, allegedly extending the window for which Wells Fargo can keep my money, accruing interest for them, while ensuring I have no ability to do so ( against my wishes, without my consent ).

I know that Wells Fargo has no problem staffing their collections department, yet when it comes to returning property to their customers, we take the back burner .It 's further enraging that despite all efforts to resolve this issue, I continue to be promised dates/times that pass without any contract from WF , and believe they are intentionally withholding these funds from me. I simply want my property returned to me in a timely fashion. If that's not possible, they should follow the guidance they spelled out in the letter, which includes turning over the funds to the state after 30 days.

2624,"I was involved in the XXXX  bank scam it has been on the news. I have XXXX though Wells Fargo. On Friday XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call from the online fraud department. The phone number the person was calling from was a legitimate number from Wells Fargo. Because when I called the number back the next day I was talking to the real Wells Fargo. So they called me on the phone claiming to be the online wells Fargo fraud department saying "" did I attempt to XXXX ( send money ) to someone in the amount of XXXX dollars '' I then said "" NO ''. Then they said "" Ok let me help you '' Lets send the money back to yourself before it gets to the other recipient. First we are going to add yourself as a recipient by using your phone number. so I did that. Then he said lets send the money back to yourself now. So that's what I did. But the money did not go back to myself it was GONE it went to somebody else that I do not even know. They went into my online banking session and hacked it.t They linked my phone number to someone elses account. Just like that the money was gone. I have been making numerous claims to wells fargo and reached the higher escalations department hours and hours on the phone and I just keep getting denied. Its just horrible I just want my money back."
2625,"I received an email about a job offering. 
I followed the prompt and got in touch with a lady name XXXX XXXX. We communicated via XXXX. I had the interview by XXXX. Once the interview was done I was told to wait 35 minutes and I would have an answer. After that 35 minutes I checked in with her and they offered me the job. I was emailed the offer letter. I signed and scanned it back to the email I had originally received the offer letter from. After that I was emailed a check with the amount of {$2400.00} on XX/XX/21. I deposited it into my account. And after a few days on XX/XX/21 I had full access to the funds. I then sent different amounts to 2 different emails via XXXX from me online banking app. They said I would get all of my work materials shipped to me after I sent the full amount to he vendor. After that I was told that I was a test to see how well I follow protocol. And they sent me another check for {$2300.00} on XX/XX/21. And said that check would be the second half that is needed to be paid to the vendor for my work materials. But, once I deposited that check the next morning ofXXXX the check was frozen and flagged. My account is now overdrawn by {$2300.00}. And it will not be fully processed until the XXXX of XXXX. After I saw that my account was overdrawn I started to investigate what was going on. I went to the ladys XXXX account, got her email and sent her an email saying that I believe that someone has been using her identity to offer job positions. She emailed me back within about 10 minutes and said that her and her company are aware of a phishing scam happening with offers of employment. 
And my bank ( Wells Fargo ) said they were unable to help me due to me being the one to authorize the payment."
2627,"Hello, I fell victim to a scam housing rental in the city of XXXX XXXX via a spoofed XXXX advertisement and leasing agreement. The end result was a loss of {$3500.00} in wire transfers believed to be designated for first months rent and deposit. My bank is Wells Fargo and the receiving bank was XXXX. 

This incident was initiated by a XXXX posting ( expired link - https : /XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ), that was intended to be a month to month rental following my move from XXXX, XXXX. 
After vetting the location and posting, reached out via email to confirm details and try to confirm legitimacy of the landlord and posting. This was best represented by the leasing agreement I requested and carefully audited. This can be sent as a digital attachment when ready for review. 
The leasing agreement for XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, called for the total {$3500.00} to be provided by wire transfer prior to move in on the date of XX/XX/22. The landlord, XXXX XXXX, requested that this be sent one month in advance to secure booking as many other rental sites do. The money was sent first on XX/XX/22 to cover the {$1000.00} deposit and finalized on XX/XX/22 to cover the {$2500.00} for first months rent. 

Fast forward to the date of move in, XXXX I drive down from XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  to find the residence is occupied by another renter. I ask the renter if the posting I had was valid, and they confirmed it was a scam under the same address. 
I attempt to contact the landlord in any way possible from the duped leasing agreement with no luck, my funds are now permanently gone. 

This was a huge financial and time loss, not to mention making me immediately XXXX  living out of a car until I could find an apartment. 

Despite the above, I managed to initiate a claim to review the fraudulent wire transfer of {$3500.00} with my bank, Wells Fargo. The banker in office told me I should expect at least a credit or full amount returned given my experience. 

Two months later ( and after several calls ) I finally get a decision from the bank via mail. They informed me that the claim was denied due to the receiving banks inability to pay back the funds. This was hugely unfair by the receiving bank with fraudulent funds and even more disappointing by my own bank not to take action for a customer. I am now placing a report with XXXX per XXXX XXXX XXXX  direction and following up here at CFPB in hopes of recouping some or all taken funds."
2632,"Back in XX/XX/2021 with Wells Fargo, I was told there was only a {$35.00} fee to wire transfer money to XXXX and those were the only fees I would incur. Well I came to find out, it cost me about {$700.00} more to wire transfer the amount of money as Wells Fargo had what I consider XXXXhidden fees '. A the time they said the exchange rate I was bring charged was the 'going rate '. After I made a complaint, they did respond stating they had a different rate to cover risks, cover costs they incur, etc. In all of the paperwork they gave me at the end, it might have been in the fine print but what they tell you verbally is completely different. I complained that these are hidden fees and they are basically lying. 

Today, I called a local branch and asked about exchanging US dollars to Euros for my trip with Wells Fargo and was told that a local branch could handle and there was no fee at all. Not even the {$35.00} fee. Just the current foreign exchange rate. Once again, this cost me an extra {$260.00} to exchange the money due to their exchange rate being so much higher. On their marketing document at the bank in very small print it states 'The exchange rate applied to a transaction includes a mark-up, which is an amount over and above the costs of funds to Wells Fargo and it is designed to compensate Wells Fargo for several considerations, including without limitation, risks taken, costs incurred, services rendered, as well as a return for the Wells Fargo on the transaction. ' Nothing I signed stated that I acknowledge this 'mark-up '. This is merely on the marketing brochure in the branch. Nothing on the receipt I received states this information. 

I just feel this is a deceptive practice being run by Wells Fargo and that their employees need to advise all customers making a foreign exchange transaction that there is a 'mark-up ' fee and be very clear on the disclosure, with customer signature, of what fees they are paying above and beyond. 

Why is the CFPB allowing this type of deceptive practices to happen?"
2634,"XX/XX/XXXX Consumer Finance Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Washington, DC XXXX To Whom it may concern : I would like to file a formal complaint against Wells Fargo Bank because of their unrealistic limitations on when and how much money I am allowed to transfer for investment purposes. 
Wells Fargo also violated my rights and discriminates against me under the Consumer Protection Laws by having my accounts listed as an Unqualified account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I created an electronic computer link between Wells Fargo Bank and XXXX Securities to transfer money to invest in the stock market. Once the link was completed Wells Fargo deposited XXXX cents into my XXXX account and withdrew that same amount and XXXX deposited XXXX cents into my Wells Fargo checking account and withdrew that same amount. 
At this point in time both Banks have successfully transferred money in and out of both accounts. 

XX/XX/XXXX I successfully transferred {$5000.00} dollars from my Wells Fargo checking account into my XXXX account to purchase stock. 

XX/XX/XXXX I needed to transfer another {$5000.00} dollars into my XXXX account in order to have enough funds available to purchase the stock I wanted. 
At this point in time Wells Fargo would not allow me to complete the transfer because I would exceed the limits, they had set at only allowing {$6000.00} dollars transfer in a rolling 30-day time period. 
I drove to the XXXX, Pennsylvania Branch of Wells Fargo and met with a Banker, XXXX XXXX and showed him the screen print I had copied when trying to complete my transfer. 
XXXX informed me of the limitations and that he could not help me and offered to file a complaint on my behalf. This was the first time I learned about these limitations and asked him to file the complaint and then left. 


( Pleas review the screen print. ) The screen print shows that I am trying to transfer {$5000.00} dollars from my checking account, which has ample funds for the transfer, to my XXXX XXXX account. The Frequency is once, Date is XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$5000.00} dollars. It would not allow me to complete the transaction because of the message at the bottom of the screen stating that I was only allowed to send {$1000.00} dollars Transfer Limits. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX and notified them that Wells Fargo had limitations and that I would not be able to transfer any more funds for the next 30 days to buy stock. XXXX informed me that they could make the transfer from their side. I placed the order for the {$5000.00} dollars to be transfer and that took place on XX/XX/XXXX. Allowing for one day settlement on the XX/XX/XXXX, I was then able to purchase XXXX XXXX stock on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Humen shareholders record date was XX/XX/XXXX, because I was not able to buy their stock on XX/XX/XXXX my shareholders record date was XX/XX/XXXX therefore, I did not receive the dividends that were paid out on XX/XX/XXXX. I lost {$75.00} dollars. I hold Wells Fargo accountable for those loses by stopping me from conducting personal business on XX/XX/XXXX due to their unreasonable transfer limits. 

Since most Banks use the Automated Clearing House network ( ACH ) for doing electronic payments without the use of paper checks, wire transfers, credit cards or cash, ACH will allow up to {$25000.00} dollar per day for transfers. 
Most Banks that use ACH have daily limits on amounts transferred, Wells Fargo is the only Bank that uses a rolling 30 day for max limits. 
XXXX XXXX is the only Bank that allows daily transfers of {$25000.00} dollars. 

I received 2 written complaint resolutions letters, one from XXXX XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX, and one from XXXX XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX. Both letters have mistakes and flaws with them. The first big problem is that neither XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX called me to discuss my complaint and to take the time to understand the event that took place on XX/XX/XXXX. The second problem with the letters is that neither of the letters show or reference the event that took place on XX/XX/XXXX. The third problem is the both letters give contact information, but when trying to get in touch with either one it never happens because you get a call taker that does not have the ability to transfer your call. The reference in both letters on transfer of funds from my account are stated incorrectly. Since I had reached my limit of transfers on XX/XX/XXXX, that as last transfer made by me from Wells Fargo. The 5 other transfer from my checking account were made by XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX. 

In XXXX XXXX, letter Dated XX/XX/XXXX he writes about Transfer Limitations and states To protect the security of your accounts and help prevent potential losses and online fraud, we place limits on the frequency and amounts of certain bank-to-Bank transfers to credit accounts. 
That statement does not work as XXXX made 5 large withdraws from my checking account and there were no red flags, no e-mails or text messages sent to me advising me of the withdraws. 

On page 2 at the top, it states the I can do an E-Bill payment up to {$50000.00} dollars a day, but can not do more than a {$6000.00} dollar transfer in 30 days to do personal business. Makes no sense! 

On page 2, it shows the limitations for Unqualified accounts and Qualified accounts. When asking a Banker why I was not a Qualified account, the answer was that only the Executive Branch makes that determination. On page 2 it suggests reading Online Access Agreement pages 20 to 25 which I did after receiving the letter. It does not show the limits, time periods or give any information about Unqualified accounts and Qualified accounts. 

After Speaking with a Banker, I was offered the opportunity to use Wells-Trade to do my buying and selling of stock and its Wells Fargo in house financial group. 

Am I to understand that by using Wells-Trade instead of XXXX that I would not have all these limits? Being a customer of Wells Fargo since XXXX, why am I not a Qualified account user? Why am I limited to only {$6000.00} dollars transfer in a 30-day period when ACH will allow {$25000.00} dollars transfer per day. 

A person that deals with the XXXX XXXX on a regular bases can not buy and sell stock with these types of limitations. I need the flexibility of buying and selling stock at a moments notes. When an IPO is posted by a company in order to buy that stock at a low price, I need to move quickly. Over the years I have seen as many as 3 IPOs offered in the same day. 

Wells Fargo is unfair and unrealistic with all these limits.

2635,"Wells Fargo has terminated our credit card merchant services because of an error they made. The error involved Wells Fargo divulging information to an unknown party over the phone. Wells Fargo assumed the caller was from our company but failed to ask for a verbal password. This resulted in the unknown caller being able to hack into our accounts and apply fraudulent charges. These charges amounted to over XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars. As a result, Wells Fargo terminated our merchant services and we are unable to process credits cards which is a mainstay of our business. This began last XX/XX/2020 and Wells Fargo has yet to rectify and reactivate our credit card merchant services. We have been working with them since this began and they are being of no help what's so ever. The biggest problem is they have placed us on the TMF list and we can not obtain services from anyone.

2642,"I recently filed a complaint, number XXXX, against XXXX XXXX  regarding the return of funds that XXXX XXXX was holding after diverting money from a fraudulent account that I had wired {$23000.00} to. The transaction was stopped by XXXX XXXX  because they saw the funds were going into a fraudulent account. They want to give the money back but Wells Fargo Bank, my bank, the account that the funds came from, won't cooperate with the process that XXXX XXXX  wants to use. XXXX XXXX wants a Hold Harmless Letter from Wells Fargo to release the funds but Wells Fargo doesn't recognize a Hold Harmless Letter and offers no alternative to resolve the situation.

The bank states that $ XXXX was credited to my new checking account on XX/XX/2021. However, the ( scam ) transfer was posted on XX/XX/2021 from my new checking account. The transfer description indicates the funds are transferred to me via XXXX!!!! 

This indicates two things. First, this is proof that someone hacked into my checking account to make it appear as though I transferred funds via XXXX to myself ( I followed a Wells Fargo representative impostor directions on XX/XX/2021 ). How do I transfer funds via XXXX to myself ( the funds were removed from my checking account )? Second, if the transaction description indicates the funds were transferred to my, WHERE DID IT GO? 

WHY DOES THE TRANSACTION DESCRIPTION INDICATE THE FUNDS WERE TRANSFERRED TO ME??? I DONT HAVE AN ACCOUNT WITH XXXX XXXX!! 

GIVE ME ALL OF MY MONEY BACK NOW!"
2645,"My email was hacked and I received fraudulent wire instructions to wire money to my title company for the purchase of a home. I sent two wires, both to fraudulent accounts at Wells Fargo Bank. The first wire was for {$150000.00} and I received only {$140000.00} back. The second wire was for {$220000.00} and I received only {$210000.00} back. I 'm short {$13000.00}.
The second wire was red flagged by Wells Fargo 's wire department as a mis-match of beneficiary name and name on the account. They did n't match. I received a call from the Wells Fargo Fraud Transaction Support team indicating they had found this problem and that they would "" block '' the funds and the recipient would not be able to use the funds. I was instructed to work with my bank that sent the funds to them recalled. I did as instructed and the funds were returned about a week later {$10000.00} short. When that happened I contacted Wells Fargo immediately and they said they could not tell me anything and that I needed to go to my bank because Wells Fargo would be giving them information. My bank said that had not received any information from Wells Fargo.
I want my funds returned to me. It 's a lot of money."

The  market exchange rate that day was  XXXX , which would have resulted in a conversion to {$12000.00}. I expected somewhere near the amount of  XXXX  afte r the exchange.      Instead , Wells Fargo  performed the conversion with its own rate of  XXXX . The amount I received at the end was {$11000.00}, which is about about a {$450.00} loss due t o Wells Fargo 's pre ferential rate.      Wells Fargo  abuses a preferential exchange rate and applies predatory practices. It charged me an unexpected and hidden exchange fee of 4 %. Furthermore, the information available o n Wells Fargo 's   website abou t the exchange rate f or that day by the bank is misleading and is not the amount the bank charged me. (   XXXX   XXXX  ,  a Wells Fargo operated  forex service. ) Furthermore, information on w hat Wells Fargo i s charging is not available online -- I was told I should 've called the bank prior to making the transaction.

Then I received a phone call from a number that is a wells fargo branch in XXXX XXXX, fl, and they knew my name, username and other personal information and asked me about this fraud transaction. In the past I have received fraud alerts from Wells Fargo. They also said there was a pending wire transfer, and I said no it was not me. They proceeded to gain access to my online account by sending me codes to my phone and having me read them to them to verify my identity to reset my password. These codes were sent by Wells Fargo. After that, they added a fraudulent email address to my account and somehow proceeded to make this {$5600.00} wire transfer without my knowledge or prior notification. That afternoon I noticed the funds were gone from my account, and then proceeded to call the wells fargo fraud claim line to open a claim and to explain what happened. They told me to go into the local branch as soon as possible to prove my identity. It was after XXXX on Tuesday so it was closed but I went first thing on Wednesday XX/XX/2021 and I talked to the banker about what happened. She ensured me this fraudulent transaction would be taken care of and I would get my money back. The banker and I called the fraud claim to ensure this was escalated and to reset my username and passwords. I left feeling better about the situation. 
I proceeded to call the fraud claims line of wells fargo and I finally got an update on Thursday XX/XX/2021. They said my claim was denied because the scammer had they information they needed to approve this wire transfer and since it was wired the money is gone. They recommended I go to the authorities and theres nothing else they can do."

On XX/XX/XXXX, the amount of the check was fully deposited to my account without any alert, email, or message from Wells Fargo. I sent the {$2800.00} to someone else as the scammer told me, and I was confident because I had the full amount of money deposited to my account.After XXXX hours, Wells Fargo retook the check money saying that it's a bad check!! 
I called them on that day, and they forwarded me to the Client Escalating employee. She told me, after a 40 minutes call, that Wells Fargo will give me the amount of the check back within XXXX business days. Nothing happened after 7 days, so I recalled them. A new Client Escalating employee answered, saying that we will not do anything for you and he hung out without listening to me."

I sent {$500.00} seven times, I was caught off card, But within 20 minutes I realize what I did and called Wells Fargo I also attempted to call XXXX, but they said I had to go through my institution. No one can seem to stop this transfer although it just had happened. 
They have been in contact with a third-party institution where my money went. They are claiming because I did it myself that I am not covered by FDIC. 
This is heartbreaking & devastating, I am a single mother and I am working extremely hard for my money to provide for my kids, and this is a huge loss for me.

On XX/XX/2022, I noticed 2 unauthorized, fraudulent transactions on my XXXX XXXX screen, along with several names on my XXXX page of people that I do not recognize as contacts : On XX/XX/2022 there was a XXXX unauthorized money transfer out of my Wells Fargo checking account, that is linked to XXXX, of {$65.00} ( case # XXXX ). 
On XX/XX/2022 there was another XXXX unauthorized transaction out of my Wells Fargo checking account, that is linked to XXXX, of {$600.00} ( case # XXXX ) On XX/XX/2022 upon noticing these 2 unauthorized, fraudulent transfers, I filed an online complaint thru Wells Fargo. 

On XX/XX/2022, without anyone contacting me to gather any information about these transactions, they told me today that the {$600.00} XXXX transfer was DENIED by Wells Fargo after their investigation. 

I've been reading that there are several complaints against XXXX for this and other type of illegal transfers with the same resolution : denied. 

Since Wells Fargo is not willing to assist me further with these illegal transfers, I'm filing a complaint here to see if further assistance could be rendered or to at least, make this known."
2661,"The following is a cursory narrative and chronology of wire fraud committed against my wife and me. Very specific detail is available upon request. 

The attached files will provide evidence of the movement of monies via wire between XXXX XXXX  and Wells Fargo Bank. The monies were wired to complete a closing of the purchase of a house to replace the home we had sold just a few days earlier the same week. 

In the XXXX  to WFC file, the first page is the original wire transfer request with all detail of the transaction on XX/XX/2021. The first email and wiring instructions were fraudulent, and the second email and wiring instructions were authentic, sent one day later. 

The Letterhead Detective file is evidence that the XXXX Sheriffs office ( Detective XXXX XXXX ) is involved, as well as the U.S. Secret Service XXXX office ( Special Agent XXXX XXXX ). 

The Complaint resolution file from Wells Fargo shows their final response to our complaint to them to return the wired funds to XXXX XXXX. 

The XXXX Account file is a line item accounting of the outgoing and incoming wire transfers. 

The Real Estate Docs file is the cover page of the purchase contract of the original house we were going to buy on XX/XX/2021, the cancellation doc of that house purchase due to Wells Fargo reluctance to return our funds and, finally, the cover page of the contract for the house we had to buy in another city ( after 40 years in XXXX XXXX XXXX!! ) after our original house deal was cancelled for undue delays by Wells Fargo. 
The second house purchase price exceeded the first by {$43000.00}. 

The Moving Storage file has receipts for excessive moving and storage activity required after cancellation of the first house contract due to delay by Wells Fargo. 


Chronology : After sale of our original house on XX/XX/2021, monies were transferred into the XXXX checking acct in my wife 's name. 

We were to close on XX/XX/2021 on the house to replace our sold home. 

On XX/XX/2021, we received the fraudulent email with fraudulent wiring instructions. 

On XX/XX/2021, my wife XXXX went to XXXX XXXX and wired {$180000.00} to Wells Fargo for the closing ... ..so we thought. 

On XX/XX/2021, in the afternoon, I called XXXX XXXX to confirm receipt of the funds for closing on XX/XX/2021. I was told that XXXX XXXX does NOT use Wells Fargo for closings. I immediately called the local branch of Wells Fargo and instructed them to freeze the account the funds were wired into ... .at that point, they confirmed the funds were there and that the account had a "" hard hold '' placed on it to secure the funds. 

As I was calling Wells Fargo, XXXX went to XXXX XXXX  and they issued a recall of the wire at that moment. Within a few days, they responded to Wells Fargo and issued Hold Harmless letters to them to facilitate the return of the wired funds. 

From XX/XX/2021 through the end of XXXX, I spent 8-10 hours per day calling every department at Wells Fargo only to be blocked and sand-bagged by dozens of clerks, supervisors, and essentially every person I spoke with at the bank. These people were strewn from the XXXX XXXX, to XXXX XXXX, to XXXX, to California, to Idaho, and on to Montana. 

Only one person was honest and forthcoming about this episode. He confirmed the hard hold on the account on XX/XX/2021, and several subsequent withdrawals by the person ( California female ) to whom the account was registered long after the hold was placed on the account. The withdrawals ended after her debit card was revoked on XX/XX/2021. 

For the next two weeks, our complaint received many case numbers which were continually closed and passed on to the next "" brick wall ''. When I happened upon the honest fellow, amazingly Wells Fargo wired {$170000.00} back to XXXX XXXX  the next day, XX/XX/2021. 



So after 26 days of stalling and shoving us off to the next purveyor of nonsense, we had lost our new house, been forced to remove furnishings and stored boxes from that house into another storage facility, give up some of the earnest money, search for another house in a ridiculous real estate market ( cost another {$43000.00} above the price of the first house, and in another city across the state ), not to mention being shorted {$5900.00} of the original wired funds ... ... .what a nightmare!!!! 

This is the first time I've had to sit down and figure the damage caused by the ongoing mismanagement and absolute heartless nonsense that came out of Wells Fargo : Let 's see : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ... ... ... ... ... {$1900.00} Earnest money lost ... ... ... ... ... ... .. XXXX Add'l cost of new house ... ... ... ... .. XXXX Shortage of returned funds ... ... .... XXXX TOTAL ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... XXXX ... .and that's just so far, not to mention two months of sleepless nights. 

I am XXXX years old, and my wife just turned XXXX ... ..at this point it's going to be difficult to gain back the money lost due to the damages of this action by Wells Fargo XXXX 

Any assistance you can provide will be greatly appreciated.

2664,"On XX/XX/2022, I was a victim of a Scam. Someone hacked my XXXX account and posed as XXXX customer service to help me purchase a sculpture. They were able to recite personal XXXX correspondence between the seller and myself, thus signifying to me they were indeed from XXXX. 

In an email ( from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) this phony XXXX customer service confirmed they would return my money if I didn't receive the sculpture and asked me to transfer {$360.00} via. XXXX to them. After I did so, when they immediately asked me for more money, I became suspicious and asked for my money back. When they refused to return my money, I hung up and immediately issued a fraud case with Wells Fargo XXXX customer service with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX opened a fraud case # XXXX and said I would be hearing from a fraud examiner in XXXX days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX when I didn't hear back, I called Wells Fargo Fraud customer service. XXXX XXXX confirmed they had my case, but I needed to speak with another department because "" it wasn't fraud but a scam ''. I was transferred to XXXX XXXX who said I needed XXXX claim, and I was transferred to XXXX XXXX who said she would transfer me to the Fraud department I was first speaking with. At this point I thought it best to go to the bank. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at the Wells Fargo 's XXXX NJ XXXX, I met with banker XXXX XXXX XXXX. he called the fraud department I was speaking with and confirmed they had my case, and I should be hearing from them soon. 

Today XX/XX/XXXX when I still had heard from no one, I called Wells Fargo 's fraud department. XXXX XXXX saw my complaint in their system, but said she needed to transfer me to the XXXX XXXX department. She said she would remain on the line, but didn't, and I was transferred XXXX to XXXX XXXX in the general customer department. At this point I gave up and decided to open this complaint. 

Additionally, I contacted XXXX and discussed this and they said basically they could not help me."

We were sent an application to fill out, and were told to send them money through XXXX. Around XX/XX/2022 I began to be suspicious when I searched the address and found the real property owners website. I called and they confirmed we had been scammed. I called Wells Fargo immediately and reported the fraud. They did not offer much help or guidance during the call. I never heard from Wells Fargo about it, but soon my account would be negative. Losing {$500.00} in a scam while I also lost my housing and job I spent what money I had left to survive hoping Wells Fargo would return my money. I turned to high interest loans but eventually it wasnt enough and my account was negative. I eventually realized Wells Fargo was not going to help me, I couldnt fill out the complaint form through XXXX cause I needed numbers from Wells Fargo they never provided me. My account eventually closed around - {$220.00}. Im disappointed because if I had the money returned it wouldve covered the balance and maybe my account would not have closed. Now I owe Wells Fargo even more money and they wouldnt do anything when I lost {$500.00}."

On Thursday, XXXX/XXXX/17 The local branch of Wells Fargo faxed the papers and on Friday they said they received them but it would take 3-5 business days for them to stop payment and another 90 days for them to re-issue a new check. Given that XXXX never received the funds in the first place and Wells Fargo claims they never received the stop payment papers delivered by XXXX XXXX, the 90 day waiting period, I am concerned I will never receive my funds."

2681,"Wells Fargo XXXX was used to transfer money purportedly to XXXX XXXX. 
I was informed that my electric service would be cut off if I did not pay on the day XX/XX/2022. 
Two payments ( {$360.00} and {$370.00} ) were made in what was a scam and were thus fraudulent and I was forced to do this under threat. 
I submitted this to Wells Fargo and they refused to credit these monies back to my checking account even though they were fraudulent and made under threat."
2682,"From my checking and savings account, I sent a wire transfer to a bank in XXXX ( where I live ) to pay for my rent XXXX of 2020. The transfer was flagged, so Wells Fargo kept the money at the branch. Even though they claimed to investigate the transaction issue and said that I should get the money within the next month, they did not return to money back to my account. 

In the correspondence letter from Wells Fargo Representative, it states that the wire transfer was recalled "" as per my request. '' This is wholly inaccurate. Please take close note of the following language sent by the Wells Fargo representative : Whenever payments are made through or to Wells Fargo, the payments may go through a sanctions screening process of the wire transfer instructions. The wire transfer in question was held by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC ) pending the verification of the full name, full address, and date of birth for the wire recipient. In order for the wire to be processed, the needed information had to be provided and a failure to do so would result in the funds to be blocked or seized. 

Now, given this information, nowhere does it state that the funds would be returned to my account if the wire did not go through. And, for the record, NOT ONCE has Wells Fargo indicated to me verbally or in writing that the wire transfer was ever made. 

Despite numerous attempts to merely locate where the money was, in XX/XX/2020 Wells Fargo notified me that I would need to pay an additional fee to receive the wired money back into my account. However, when I called Wells Fargo services in XXXX, I was informed that the money was still being held at the branch, and had NOT been wired. 

I have never received confirmation nor documentation nor notification that the wire transfer was sent to the intended recipient. I did not request that the wire be retracted, I requested that my money not be blocked or seized by Wells Fargo or the OFAC. 

If the money was sent to the correct recipient, that would be acceptable. However, given the nature of this situation, it is reasonable that I ask for confirmation and documentation that this has occurred. 

Further, there are conflicting statements being made by the Wells Fargo Representatives : 1 ) The Wells Fargo representative clearly states that the funds will be blocked or seized if the adequate documentation for the recipient is not received. However, it is clear that it was not received. 

2 ) The Wells Fargo representative states that a recall request was made on XX/XX/2020. However, I paid for a wire recall in XXXX, 2020, a full 8 months later. 

3 ) The Wells representative states that unsuccessful attempts were made by the branch to contact me to gather information. This is false, the branch did reach me numerous times in XXXX when I first learned that the wire had been blocked, and they were told that they would continue to work on resolving the issue on their end. I also have documentation that I called the branch on numerous occasions and corresponded regularly with XXXX XXXX from the branch during that period of time which is well documented. 

4 ) The Wells Fargo representative states that the case was closed on XX/XX/2020, and that the wire had been issued to the beneficiary bank. However, I received a call from the branch in XXXX saying that they were still diligently trying to work on the case, but that the OFAC was still withholding the funds. 

5 ) Allow me to reiterate, there hasn't been a shred of evidence supplied by the Wells Fargo representative that the funds were ever cleared by the OFAC, and by his own admission, they did not have the proper information to do so as stated in the second paragraph of his response regarding this issue. 

6 ) Wells Fargo called me in XXXX of 2020, telling me that there was a way that I could get my money back, but would need to credit my account to cover the cost. It was not indicated that this was a recall from the beneficiary 's bank, or that Wells Fargo had successfully made the transfer. If this had been indicated to me, I would have indicated that it was not necessary as I still live in the house of the deceased beneficiary, and would have simply paid an additional month of rent. Which would be fine. 

7 ) All other attempts to allegedly recall the funds that this Wells Fargo representative claims were not "" per my request '' as this was done neither in writing nor payment. The only time I paid a fee to have my money returned to me was in XXXX, which is documented, and at no juncture was it ever indicated that this was to recall a successful wire transfer. 

I believe that the Wells Fargo representative should be required to show documentation that the wire transfer was successful. If the representative can show documentation that the wire transfer was successfully made to the intended account in XXXX on the dates that were described, I will consider this case completely closed. If not, another representative of XXXX XXXX XXXX will surely file another claim. 

Please do NOT close this case until this matter is resolved satisfactorily, and that Wells Fargo representatives have provided documentation for their claims, as I have. 


Wire transfer total : XXXX USD Wire transfer fee : XXXX USD ( REIMBURSED ) Additional fee to have the money returned : XXXX USD"
2683,"ON XX/XX/XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX Fraduently took {$53000.00} out of my business account under the guise of providing XXXX-year business mentorship and consulting by the international business coach XXXX XXXX XXXX However, NO contract was ever sent as promised and NO services have been received to date, and my multiple attempts to get a refund since XX/XX/XXXX have gone unanswered. After finally recovering from XXXX and being able to seek & obtain counsel my lawyer said this wire was taken under false and fraudulent pretenses. She said it was "" Theft By Deception '' thus also it was "" FRAUD '' and I am legally able to request a Swift Recall for the full {$53000.00} Wire Transfer. 

To be clear this is NOT A CIVIL MATTER because there is NO LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT between MYSELF, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. Thus this was a FRAUDULENT WIRE sent under FRAUDULENT PRETENSES and should be handled per FRAUDULENT WIRE PROCEDURE. 

I filed the fraud complaint with Wells Fargo XXXX Department on XX/XX/XXXX Case # XXXX And was expecting the SAME PROCESS I experienced when someone filed a wire fraud claim against me which was for them to Freeze the account and initiate the "" Swift Recall '' of the funds. I was told on XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX in the XXXX XXXX Department that the wire fraud case was still open and that I needed to submit additional documents such as the FTC complaint filed and the FBI Fraud Complaint filed against the individual of the company directly to the wire department as she was closing out my previous CFPB complaint. She mentioned she was closing all matters on HER SIDE but that it remained open on the wire department side. Also, I have a recording of what XXXX said would be in the letter closing out her case and it is contradictory to what was actually put into the letter and erodes the good faith I believed she was acting in. It is clear when she closed the case on XX/XX/XXXX they had no intentions of pursuing the matter of the fraud claim I submitted against XXXX XXXX XXXX, however that was NEVER communicated to me in the numerous conversations I had with XXXX from XXXX. Also, She said she had until XXXX to resolve all my complaints however it was clear the wiring claim against XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX was rushed if at all actually pursued per the notes shared with me, which I have on Recording. 

To date I have NEVER had any investigators call me regarding the matter, nor did they ask or want the offered copies of the FRAUD complaints filed with the FTC and FBI. 

Furthermore today XX/XX/XXXX I was told the case was officially closed by the XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX due to the account holder "" not being reachable by phone. '' However, let 's be clear I was not reachable by phone prior to Wells Fargo FREEZING MY ACCOUNT and initiating a recall of the funds, AND threatening to close my account all over the $ 10K fraud claim in question against me. There was NO consideration for me not answering my phone or more importantly my innocence until I pursued the matter via CFPB and fought vigorously and tirelessly day in and day out for over XXXX weeks, only then I was finally interviewed regarding the claim and allowed to submit documentation proving that the fraud claim against me was FALSE. However, the burden of proof to keep my $ XXXX from being recalled and my account from being closed solely fell on me filing a complaint to get a fair investigation and providing substantial documentation showing that there was NO FRAUD and it was truly a civil matter. 

XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX has NO CONTRACT with me for services and has PROVIDED NO SERVICES. This is Theft by Deception. I was tricked and scammed into wiring my $ XXXX to XXXX 's Wells Fargo account and IF they choose to willingly aide and abet him in his fraudulent behavior I will have to take up a legal grievance against Wells Fargo as well. The burden of proof should rest with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX to prove they did not fraudulently take my money. 

It is clear and apparent Wells Fargo has different rules for different account holders. Because XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX is holding more money at Wells Fargo it is being given preferential treatment AND I only believe the $ XXXX was closed in my favor to give precedence to Wells Fargo is able to close the $ XXXX Not in my Favor. However, I fought to prove the claim was false and XXXX XXXX simply does not have to "" answer his phone '' and Wells Fargo is willing to forego their fiduciary responsible In addition, Regulation E, protects individual consumers engaging in electronic fund transfers and carries out the purposes of the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which establishes the basic rights, liabilities, and responsibilities of EFT consumers of financial institutions that offer these services. I do not believe from the pattern of behavior Wells Fargo has exhibited that they have honored their responsibilities under Regulation E. 

Whether I have {$30000.00} or {>= $1,000,000} in my account at Wells Fargo the treatment and the procedures used in Wire Fraud Claims should be uniform. Anything else is discriminatory at best and at the very least malfeasance on the part of Wells Fargo. 

This is the last attempt I will give Wells Fargo to rectify their wrongs but If this matter can not be rightfully resolved with my $ XXXX wire being recalled and refunded to me I will be suing Wells Fargo for the discriminatory behavior, as well as the pain and suffering it has inflicted on me from the moment it froze ALL OF MY BUSINESS ASSETS in my XXXX XXXX account back on XX/XX/XXXX."
2685,"On XX/XX/2022 I initiated a wire transfer from my Wells Fargo account to my bank account at XXXX in XXXX. My identity was confirmed via text message to the phone number associated with my account. The same day I received XXXX messages from Wells Fargo stating that my wire transfer was confirmed and initiated. Later I received a message stating that I no longer have online access to my account and must call a 1 800 number that can not be called from outside the XXXX. The loss of online access is the subject of a separate complaint pending with CFPB, and although I have communicated to Wells Fargo that I can not call the designated number, both through my account designated phone number, and by calling and emailing various other international numbers and emails. 

The new complaint concerns the belated cancellation of my wire transfer several days after it had been confirmed. ( The previous complaint concerns the loss of online access and refusal to provide any way for me to do as required to rectify that situation. ) On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email stating that my wire transfer was cancelled. I now have essentially no funds in my XXXX account and pending direct debits will not be paid. I will no doubt lose related phone, utility and other services, and probably my XXXX account itself. I was led to believe that although I lost online access my previously approved wire transfer had been made. 

This is my 4th complaint this year. One thing they all have in common is Wells Fargo making it impossible to communicate to them in the required manner and thus providing no recourse other than CFPB."

The person gave me instruction to firstly download an app named XXXX Remote Desktop, and asked me to turned on the app, read to number on the screen to him, then follow his order to go to my XXXX account, do steps that I didnt understand ( a day later, I realized that the stepped allow him to scam {$100.00} XXXX XXXX from me ). After quite many steps, the scammer asked me to go to my orders, and showed him the amount of money for my items, and told me that he needed to send me a refund, but my XXXX account were frozen for 30 minutes due to the activity having been done before. Then, he asked me whether used any money apps like XXXX, XXXX, I told him that I used XXXX. Then, he scammer told me to open my bank account, and follow his steps to verify my ownership to both my XXXX account and banking account by going to XXXX, and sending out codes for verification purposes. I trusted him to be an XXXX employee and follow his steps, adding in new recipient : XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) and ending up sending out four codes : XXXX ( {$740.00} ), XXXX ( {$670.00} ), XXXX ( {$540.00} ), XXXX ( {$540.00} ) to this recipient. During this whole time ( 3 hours ), the scammer hung up on me after I sent out the first two codes, and called me back using a different phone number : ( XXXX ) XXXX, and kept on reassuring me that the XXXX XXXX was not a real person, but just a dummy account created by XXXX, which couldnt receive any money even if I wanted to send money to it, and the digit I sent out was simply verification codes in the process. The scammer even provided me with his supposedly personal employee information : XXXX, XXXX XXXX to reassure me and gain my trust to keep follow the steps. He even transferred my call to his supervisor because I broke down many times throughout the process, and was crying out loud on the phone for the feelings of being scammed. But, with the trust that it was a real employee, I tried to put faith in humanity and followed the steps trusting their words that my money would appear back because the transactions were pending, and that after I finished the next step, all money would be back on my account. Eventually, when he asked me about my XXXX limit, and about sending my codes to another recipient : XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) with the codes of XXXX ( {$980.00} ). I couldnt take it anymore and used another phone to call another number supposedly for XXXX. I asked the person on the line to help me check the number ( XXXX ) XXXX, the person told me that that number didnt belong to XXXX and it came from XXXX XXXX I froze, broke down, and cried even louder that I just lost {$2500.00} from scam caller. The scammer heard that and hang up, then I immediately called my bank Wellsfargo to try to stop the XXXX transactions. I filed 4 XXXX claims, and called to Wellsfargo for so many times ( one time every two days ) because I was so scared and that as a student, {$2500.00} meant a lot to me. It was a part of my tuition. Wellsfargo gave me 4 claim numbers : XXXX ( {$740.00} ), XXXX ( {$670.00} ), XXXX ( {$540.00} ), XXXX ( {$540.00} ). After waiting and calling back and forth to Wellsfargo to check. They simply closed my claims and provided no way for me to pursue my case ( {$2500.00} loss due to scam caller ) except to contact them and request copies of the document they used to complete their research. I am so devastated and disappointed in the customer protection system of Wellsfargo, and wanted justice to be done to the scam caller. But, apparently, I could do nothing against this type of scam when I was responsible for authorizing my own transactions. I found this fact ridiculous and extremely unbearable."
2689,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was approached online by a man named "" XXXX XXXX '' ( video attached ) who positioned themselves as an artist that was commissioned for an art project that they wanted to use my likeness in. I was told that their client would send me a {$3000.00} check from which I was to send {$2500.00} to the artist to complete the project. I was sent the first check on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX and XXXX ) via email from a XXXX and was advised to submit via my mobile app. I did so and my bank prompted me that a portion, the majority, of the funds would be held for investigation until XX/XX/XXXX. I told the person I was on contact with and they then sent me a second check on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX and XXXX ) that I submitted the same way, and was given the same message, that the bank would hold a portion until XX/XX/XXXX, and I was told via email from the bank to refrain from using funds until it shows in my balance. The initial {$3000.00} check had never shown in my balance up that that point ( in image XXXX it'll show as if it was added to my balance, but my available balance at the time did not reflect the + {$3000.00} shown, I only had {$200.00} showing ), but on XX/XX/XXXX the second check was apparently "" cashed '' onto my account leading me to believe my bank had done their due diligence and that the check was valid Initially for this check I also got a notification that it would be held until the XXXX ( XXXX ) leading me believe that if the money was to show up in my account on or before then I am safe to use it as the whole reason it's held din the first place is to confirm it's a good check. That same day, XX/XX/XXXX, despite the hold notice, the money was made available to me in my balance. 

So in turn believing I was a the clear to complete my portion of what I thought was a legitimate professional deal, I sent XXXX XXXX payments out to people the person claims to be him team of artists. The first was {$220.00} and then two payments of {$1000.00} each was sent, totaling {$2200.00} sent via XXXX. At the time these transactions were only made possible because of the money made available on my account. I initially only had about {$700.00} in my checking account. Image XXXX is how much I had in my account after sending the first {$220.00}, that + {$3000.00} that was shown in XXXX from the second check and was the only money made available i.e. my balance never read XXXX. In addition the mobile adjustments and check return unpaid, despite showing thee the screenshots as carried out on the XXXX before the XXXX 's were sent, those were actually carried out on my account after the XXXX payments had gone through and back-dated by the bank to make it look like I willingly made an overdraft to my account which would have been impossible as I would have been given a warning of insufficient funds ( the proof I have of this is the upper left time stamps in the XXXX confirmation screenshots attached that I took as soon as each payment was sent show times 2 hours prior to when the notification of the returned check was sent ( XXXX ). 

So after these checks were returned as bad checks it became obvious I was scammed. My bank reflected the overdraft on my account and moved to close each account shown in these screenshots but after making my case they chose to retain me as a client. The reason my account had shown a - {$6600.00} balance on the XXXX was in backdating these transactions the bank had reflected the initial {$3000.00} as also a returned check but once communicated it never reached my account, to was corrected to read - {$3800.00} which was then taken from my saving account from my bank to correct the overdraft. The reason that reads so much is because the scammer initially requested I make the payment through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX so I had sent {$2200.00} from my bank between those apps, but when that method failed I made an immediate transfer back too my account of {$2200.00} ( XXXX ) that reflected immediately. Just stressing here that there was never a time before I made these XXXX transactions that my balance did no reflect that I had enough to make the payment as my banks email would claim ( XXXX ). However that transaction was also delayed until the XXXX after my bank make adjustments to my transaction timeline ( XXXX ). 


So after all this of course I called my bank, put in a claim, go the initial - {$6600.00} corrected to read - {$3800.00} but from there essentially I was told I was liable for all my transactions despite the fraud/scam and also despite my bank not protecting me and not doing the due diligence that holding the money was supposed to protect me from. In the midst of this the scammer is continuing to communicate with me that the checks were real and trying to appeal that they'd work with me to solve this, all while not revealing the identities of who I supposedly sent my money to via XXXX XXXX eventually they tried too promise repayment via XXXX  which I refused ). MY case was that I should not be held liable for he overdraft due to Wells fargo 's lack of due diligence in making the funds seemingly available to me to use and leading m to commit an overdraft that they only made visible after the fact. In their own correspondence ( XXXX ) it reads "" To help avoid overdrafts or returned item ( non-sufficient funds/NSF ) fees, make sure the money you deposited is available in your account to cover your transactions. Overdraft fees do not apply to prepaid cards. '' I tried to emphasize that since they made the money "" available '' in my account to cover my transactions and gave no additional warning of waiting X days to see if the check is returned, that I shouldn't be liable for the backdated returned check or the overdraft. As a user I had done my part and waited for the hold to be lifted, and them lifting the hold showed me that they had done their due diligence, which after the fact it showed they did not and still they made it seem as though it was all my fault when all signs pointed that I was in the clear. 

In talking to my bank I submitted a claim and was even transferred to the executive office to talk to those who denied my claim and was told that the fact that they retained my accounts was their only resolution and essentially i was just our {$2200.00} and they were not going to correct it. I also submitted another claim to hopefully reverse the XXXX transactions and again the bank said they done their part correctly and that they will not issue a refund, only request that the bank to which it was sent will issue a refund, for which the agent told me that chance unlikely."

The complaint was logged, but the deposit remained frozen. On XX/XX/22 I called Wells Fargo again asking to release my funds. I was connected to the escalated service department, to the agent by the name of XXXX. That said XXXX refused to provide his identification number and said that this is the bank 's usual practice to hold money for the so called "" new account ' for more than 6 business days and hung up on me!

Please take into consideration that the officer who opened my account did NOT say anything about these restrictions of a "" new account ''.

2694,Wells Fargo bank is withholding emergency financial expenses due to the the bank monthly fees charge the check account The account isnt eligible for overdraft protection The reason the hold is on the account is because of the overdraft being caused by the monthly fees for the account I have evidence to support the fact I am not able to overdraft due to Account agreement disclosure I also been discriminated against by the banks customer service bankers negligence and placement of the delay causing server complications I been receiving different advertisement and information regarding resolution of this issue

2703,"Wells Fargo cut off my XXXX payments before the 36 months the policy promised. My start date of XXXX benefits was XX/XX/XXXX. My payments for 36 months should originally have terminated at the end of XXXX. Because of my age ( XXXX when benefits started ) and another special criteria, XXXX XXXX, the policy allows an additional 12 months of benefits beyond the regular ( due to my age and XXXX XXXX  ) I should have been paid through XX/XX/XXXX. See attachments for Plan criteria. 

Although my treating doctor asserted that I was still XXXX a separate unqualified doctor hired by Wells Fargo, stated that I was not impaired. My doctor was a specialist and their doctor was not. They paid her {$840.00} to write two paragraphs to the banks benefit to deny the benefits.

This summary contains information about major changes to the plan and must be sent to plan participants within 210 days after the end of the plan year when the changes were made. I did not receive the summary of material modifications and spent months attempting to just get a copy of the original Plan. 

The XX/XX/XXXX version of the Plan document ( WF Policy ) eliminated the reference to special mental health conditions that allotted for an additional 12 month of benefits. I was qualified for that special consideration. But the copy of the Plan sent to me in XX/XX/XXXX did not contain the paragraph referencing the special conditions and its removal was not documented in the amendment section at the back of the document. It seemed that the material had just disappeared. I looked up the employee copy of the XXXX in the employee handbook in XX/XX/XXXX and the section was not remove in that document which is supposed to mirror the Plan, ( the document in the employees handbook ) The XX/XX/XXXX official copy of the Plan did not document the removal of the special circumstances section. The amendment section in the Plan is required to document all additions, changes and deletions when changes are implemented. Wells Fargo failed to do so.

2704,"On XX/XX/2022 I received a text asking me if I had tried to send XXXX via XXXX to XXXXXXXX XXXX. I responded No but immediately called Wells Fargo Bank to see what was going on. They told me it was a scam and had me to send a screen shot of the text to their phishing department. Less than 10 minutes from sending the email I received a phone call from the Wells Fargo number and put it on speakerphone. The gentleman told me he was an employee of Wells Fargo and was calling to save my money. He proceeded to tell me to transfer my money in savings to my checking account. He even knew how much I had in my accounts. He gave me an email address of XXXX. He had me go to XXXX on my WF app and had me to start sending my money to this email on XXXX. I told him I didnt feel right about this but he said he would never jeopardize his job with WF and gave me a badge number of XXXX I had a witness, my roommate, XXXX XXXX who was hearing the conversation so she can attest to what was said. I begrudgingly sent my money telling him the whole time I didnt feel good but he just kept reassuring me everything was legitimate. He then told me he would send me an email to change my username and password but didnt receive in 5 minutes and called WF to find out why and she said I had been scammed. She filled out disputes for me and told me how to change my username and password. I am in a XXXX home and have no way to replace my money. This was for me to go to my daughters wedding and if I dont get the money back I will not be able to go to her wedding."
2705,"Recently I was in touch with a potential buyer of a couch I was selling through XXXX XXXX. The scammer messaged me on my XXXX XXXX saying they wanted to buy the couch but said they needed my information first. After multiple conversations about the transaction, I received emails from XXXX, which ended up being a fake email account, that said I needed to send the buyer money so I could be reimbursed the money sent plus the money for the couch ( {$500.00} ). After sending the buyer {$1500.00} total, the account I was messaging was deleted and I did not receive any money back in return for the couch or from what I had sent them after many emails from XXXX saying that I would. I have been in touch with Wells Fargo about this but they have declined to give back any of the money after the investigation was completed. Wells Fargo did not ask for any information about the fake account or emails they just got my verbal explanation and claimed it was a consensual agreement to send the money which it was not."
2706,"I file a Complaint with Wells Fargo related to a XXXX transaction for {$600.00}. The transaction date was XX/XX/22. The transaction was sent to the wrong email address.

Wells Fargo sent a a letter on XX/XX/22 that they were still investigating and would follow up, but they have not. On XX/XX/22 I called to request that Wells Fargo send me information they are using in their "" research ''. I was told this could take longer than 30 days, but I may hear from Wells Fargo on their own initiative at some point."
2710,"Below is a letter I sent Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX- it is a comprehensive description of my case. I'm happy to provide more details securely upon request i.e. check images, confirmation numbers and case numbers : I have been a Wells Fargo customer for almost XXXX years. We are escalating this to your office since we have tried to resolve this issue with multiple people without success at Wells Fargo. Please review the below information on Case Number ( will provide if needed ) and help resolve my issue with Wells Fargo not returning my {$55000.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was instructed by a Wells Fargo teller at the XXXX, XXXX  XXXX that the best way to transfer funds would be via a cashiers check. I deposited the check for {$55000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX via the XXXX mobile app and I received a confirmation from XXXX ( confirmation # provided if needed ) the same day. On XX/XX/XXXX a check image was posted to my XXXX account as Accepted. 

After purchasing {$55000.00} of investments, 10 days later, on a XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX, our financial adviser received a call from XXXX XXXX that Wells Fargo was not accepting the check due to poor image quality. Furthermore, I didnt receive any written or phone notification from Wells Fargo that the check was declined. Due to commissions and market fluctuations, Wells Fargo not accepting the check was forcing me to lose significantly more than my initial investment. 

First thing Monday morning XX/XX/XXXX I went to the XXXX Wells Fargo branch to try to resolve the issue. I provided legible images of the check to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Banker at Wells Fargo. After XXXX hours of speaking with various customer service reps, they claimed it was simply the "" automated system '' declining the check. I was told I was responsible for an {$820.00} surety bond fee or to wait 6 months for the check to void while my entire lifes savings just sits with Wells Fargo. 

Neither of the above recommended options is acceptable. I did nothing wrong, followed the appropriate directions and should not be responsible for any fees or withholding. I want my money returned to me immediately. 

Having missed hours of work, on XX/XX/XXXX my dad had to take time from his busy schedule to personally go to the branch and try and get this resolved. He did his best to try to resolve the situation with numerous executives and branch managers that were seemingly nowhere to be found. Apparently, the XXXX Wells Fargo doesnt have a branch manager. Later, we found out that the acting Branch Manager was XXXX XXXX from the XXXX XXXX. My dad also worked with XXXX, XXXX XXXX at the XXXX branch. After many hours, numerous calls, many emails, and meetings over multiple days our issue was finally escalated to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Case Specialist ). That team said they would take 10 days to get back to us. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, our financial advisor spoke with XXXX XXXX again. They offered a simple solution, asking Well Fargo to provide a letter saying Wells Fargo would be willing to accept the check. After multiple days and discussions, Wells Fargo finally sent a letter with limited information over a week later, on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX explained that they had escalated the situation to the Deposits group to find a solution but was informed that they could not credit the account and re-present the cashiers check. The solution was to re-issue the check which Wells Fargo was not willing to do without me purchasing an {$820.00} XXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I left another message for XXXX XXXX since we had still not heard back after 10 days. I also emailed XXXX letting her know I had not heard back from XXXX. We were informed the case was escalated to XXXX XXXX, Senior Escalations Representative at the Consumer and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX called my dad, XXXX, the next day XX/XX/XXXX on a recorded line. It was apparent that XXXX had not done any research on the situation after it being escalated to him over a week prior. After both of us ( on speakerphone ) having to explain the entire situation to him again, even though he had the case number and should have researched it before calling us, he told us he couldnt do anything without further researching the case. 
I called XXXX several times by Tuesday on a Wells Fargo recorded line XX/XX/XXXX to follow up and was only able to get his voicemail. I called XXXX to try and get some information and he attempted to reach XXXX while keeping me on hold for quite some time. XXXX informed me XXXX was not available and after I made a fuss and insisted this situation be resolved, I was put on hold again while XXXX reached out to XXXX. Somehow XXXX was magically available after XXXX reached out the second time. XXXX answered the phone by telling me he was leaving for the day and had to make a personal appointment. He informed me that he sent a letter to my dad explaining once again, that Wells Fargo will not offer any solution other that having me pay the {$820.00} surety bond or waiting 90 days while they sit on my money. I was very upset that after all this waiting for an executive, taking time off work to deal with this matter in person, hours of email exchanges and phone calls, I was in the exact same position I started in. I requested numerous times to be given an email address or contact number for XXXX superior and he refused to give me any further details or make even the bare minimum effort to connect me with another person. He repeatedly told me he had to make a personal appointment and finally hung up on me. 

We later received said letter from XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX. We then received another letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX, stating Wells Fargo is looking into this and theyd respond within XXXX days. The fact that we received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX reinforcing XXXX XXXX decision and then a letter dated XXXX  days later claiming Wells Fargo is looking into it, offers written proof of the incompetency with which this case has been handled and the subsequent confusion it has created. 

On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I looked up contact information for the executive offices of Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX and sent them this letter. By XX/XX/XXXX I heard back via email from XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Office Case XXXX ), with Wells Fargo once again stating Thank you for sharing your concerns with us. We know this needs our attention, and were looking into it for you. On XX/XX/XXXX I got a call from XXXX with no information other than she will research my case. By XX/XX/XXXX I got an email and call from XXXX which was essentially the same template used by XXXX and XXXX While its disheartening to learn of concerns such as yours, we also appreciate your comments because they enable us to identify areas of training and process improvement for our employees. Each customer truly has the ability to help shape our strategy in providing the service you expect and deserve. We will communicate any possible coaching opportunities to our team members ; however, we are unable to share outcomes of employee investigations. On behalf of Wells Fargo, we would like you to know that its our goal to provide superior customer service. Were sorry your experience didnt reflect our standards. 

There is no excuse that a Wells Fargo customer of nearly 10 years should be treated with such disregard and lack of transparency. I felt completely insignificant and neglected. 

This entire email is just a base representation of the work my dad, XXXX XXXX XXXX and myself have put into getting this matter resolved. I have a comprehensive email trail, documentation of check images, a confirmation number that the check was received and cashed. I will happily provide any of this information upon request via encrypted email or alternative secure methods. At this point I have done everything possible to get this situation resolved with Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX directly and my patience has been exhausted so : Please consider this my final demand, as I have begun or am doing the following : As of XX/XX/XXXX I have filed a civil lawsuit against defendants Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX ( Case Number : XXXX XXXX ) I have spoken with my Congressman XXXX XXXX  and initiated an investigation via a Constituent Service XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted a poor review with the XXXX and filed a case I submitted a poor review with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and will continue writing poor reviews on various social media platforms. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed this document after doing my own research to find executive contact info. I have also mailed this certified mail to your headquarters per your attention. 
If this is not resolved quickly both my father and I will be closing our Wells Fargo accounts that we have had for over 10 years, one of which is a substantial business account. 

Your help would be very much appreciated to amiably resolve this matter to avoid further escalation. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"

The phone number was the legit Wells Fargo number as I had double-checked the back of my debit card. They said I'd have to XXXX  myself the funds that were compromised, since the daily limit is {$1000.00} they set up an appointment the following day to finish it. The next day on the XXXX the scammer who impersonated the bank did call me on time and asked me to wire transfer the funds to myself. I figured it was legit since as stated they masked their real number with the Wells Fargo customer service number and followed the exact same procedures the bank does. The scammer however had access to my mobile login info and was able to use my information to send the money to his own account which I found out is a XXXX account. I called the XXXX to ask for a follow-up explanation and they informed me it was a scam. Immediately the lady who answered me made me feel ridiculous and said this fraud was all over the news. I had no idea this was happening as Wells Fargo didn't address this mass fraud problem in an official letter until the XXXX of XXXX. I have been going back and forth with the bank trying to get my money back but they are saying it's my problem as I ultimately sent the money. It's insane that it's been nearly 3 months of me being sent back and forth to different departments with representatives not even knowing how to handle it, and me spending nearly 2 hours on the phone with them. I have no clear answer as to how or if I will be able to get my money back, as the claims have been opened and closed multiple times.

2724,"Since my report to XXXX Base on : refer XXXX can XXXX XXXX advocate for the payment of the permit fee for the presidential office?, as wells fargo argues that he has received orders from president joe biden to immediately complete the transfer of funds to my bank account in the name of my fund benefeciary. 

this relates to the payment of a permit fee for the process of sending my funds to the presidential office, according to him, with a permit fee of XXXX . and since my condition is bankrupt and i don't have the funds to pay, so i made an agreement and agreement with wells fargo according to the maximum that i can try to pay XXXX  , and they agreed that my XXXX $ shortfall will be completed by wells fargo bank, after my 2nd payment amounted to XXXX . and it is the responsibility of wells fargo to process and finalize it. 

I'm worried about this if wells fargo stops sending my funds and delays it in the process of completing my transfer of funds as a benefeciary of funds, because I can't afford to pay again up to XXXX , or because wells fargo forgets and breaks the promise we made. 

It is with this concern that I submit a submission to submit an advocacy to XXXX XXXX for the payment of a processing permit at the US presidential office, based on information from the wells fargo bank. at least I'm free from paying again after my last agreed cancellation. this is to emphasize and clarify the state of my position and request legal assistance on the laws in force in the federal us for the relief of my tax burden. And I at the same time apply for President Joe Biden 's prerogative to release my funds which have become my rights, for immediate delivery to my bank account, this is based on information from Wells Fargo Bank itself. 


Can the XXXX XXXX  advocate for me about the {$400.00} presidential office permit fee for the process of sending my international funds, if there is a case of delay or termination of sending my funds transfer process by wells fargo bank, because because I can't afford to pay anymore.??? 

and I don't want to talk about this to my friends, because my friends don't know as a sender what is the total amount that I will receive from this wells fargo bank? About this information from wells fargo bank. for not wanting to discuss this matter with her either. 

That's why I'm very worried about the behavior of Wells Fargo Bank, which broke the promise we had agreed on my inability to pay, namely that in this case they asked for another payment, after I paid the last one yesterday, which was approved and agreed yesterday. 

and I'm confused and don't know for sure how much will be transferred to my bank account? Even though I have been informed by the Wells Fargo Bank that XXXX XXXX dollars USD I will receive, but I am in doubt and ask, what is the real money? is it possible that my friend lied with the transfer of XXXX $??? Does she know or not? and I forgot the money that I sent to her and I don't remember the amount. 

and I don't want to talk about this to my friends, because my friends don't know as a sender what is the total amount that I will receive from this wells fargo bank? About this information from wells fargo bank. for not wanting to discuss this matter with her either. 

So how could my friend As the sender not know the amount of transfers she sent to me changed from the amount of XXXX $ changed in nominal to XXXX $ XXXX dollars Uad that I will receive. This makes me confused also to the sender.??? 

what if the attitude of wells fargo is not committed and consistent as we agreed, regarding my payment of administrative fees, this shows evidence that they are coercing me, for showing froud 's actions in the banking world. 

This is really weird and makes no sense to me. I can't stop thinking about this matter the amount of transfers, this is really beyond my expectations, and beyond the logic of the banking system around the world what is happening at wells fargo bank at this time that I'm experiencing. 

If there is a cost reduction this makes sense. with deducted transfer and administrative costs. What is even more unreasonable is when the bank asks for continuous payments without settlement and a final settlement to properly realize the transfer of funds. 

At least I asked for my money back from my payment to all of them, either wells fargo bank or irs department. I'm really dizzy with all of them, like a subtle blackmail that makes my savings also used up for payments to all of them. 

I ask for help from the XXXX XXXX  and analysts, to verify they are also correct about the funds I receive, and protect me from all of them, in case of fraud and froud that makes my life even more difficult here."

Wells Fargo couldn't apply the fund due to my account 's limitation that I wasn't aware of at the time - wrong account type ( XXXX  doesn't allow international wires )- so it was returned to the originating bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/2022. Confirmation ( from Wells Fargo ) is required for the availability of this fund. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX claimed they have submitted several confirmation requests ( including follow ups ) but Wells Fargo isn't responding."
2730,"On XXXX XXXX, 2021 I was scammed into taking {$13000.00} in cash out of my XXXX  checking account ( money which I didn't realize was actually mine because a fraudster had added it to my computer screen, on top of the money that was already in the account ) and, at the direction of the scammer, advised to take it to a Wells Fargo branch and deposit it in the following account, which the scammer intimated was an XXXX account : XXXX XXXX XXXX Acct. # : XXXX Transaction # : XXXX I took it to the Wells Fargo branch in XXXX, NJ, and deposited the cash in the account, which the teller recognized and acknowledged as a business checking account. 
Clearly, the account was fraudulent, or the owner had no idea perhaps that money was being laundered through his or her account. 
The XXXX XXXX police informed me that they had frozen the account ( whatever that means ) on XXXX XXXX. Since then, my phone calls to Detective XXXX XXXX have gone unanswered. 
I'm trying to recover the money. 
To my astonishment, the account still appears to be open! This I learned through the first level of the fraud department at Wells Fargo who was observing it on his computer screen. He was not at liberty to tell me what name was on the account or how much money was in there. 
So I submitted a complaint to Wells Fargo, and the response I got was : "" We understand you believe you initiated a deposit because of a fraud scheme ; however, your request to reclaim the cash you deposited into your account ( my account? It was an account I had no knowledge of, nor had I ever heard of XXXX XXXX XXXX ) is an example of an adverse claim against a deposit. This means that after funds are in a depositor 's bank account ( hey, it was NOT my bank account -- duhhhhhh! ), a third party does not have the right to receive the cash back simply by making a demand for the funds. We regret we are not in a position to be more helpful at this time. '' The account was and clearly is a fraudulent account. ( It occurred to me that Wells Fargo was at the heart of a massive fraud scandal that made the headlines several years back. ) If the account is still viable, as I believe it is, then surely Wells Fargo must be aware that either 1 ) it's fraudulent and possibly a money laundering account, or 2 ) not fraudulent, but being USED by someone as a money laundering account without the account owner 's knowledge. 
In any case, I had lodged a complaint against XXXX ( from whom I had withdrawn the money ) earlier, but I was foolishly pointing in the wrong direction. XXXX 's attitude was, well you took the money out and benefited from it ( I didn't benefit from it, I lost it ), so too bad for you. 
Anyway, perhaps you can investigate this. It has a very bad smell to it. 
The account was clearly fraudulent on XXXX XXXX, and if it has been open all the while, that would suggest the likelihood that it's fraudulent now. 
Perhaps you can look into this for me. 
Thanks in advance for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX"
2736,"On XXXX XXXX, 2022 I got a text that my son ( who also has a Wells Fargo checking, savings and credit card account ) had sent me {$3500.00} via XXXX. I immediately called him, and he said he had just received a text from "" Wells Fargo '' asking if he authorized a {$200.00} transaction at XXXX XXXX. He replied "" XXXX '' and right after received a phone call that came up as "" Wells Fargo '' on his phone. He answered and the person on the phone said he was a Wells Fargo representative and my son confirmed he did not authorize a Home Depot transaction OR a {$3500.00} XXXX transfer from his Wells Fargo credit card to my checking account. The "" representative '' ( scammer ) said he would help him fix this. They contacted me on a 3 way call. The man said he was a Wells Fargo representative and that in order to fix my sons account, I needed to send that money back thru XXXX to my sons checking account and they would credit it back to his Wells Fargo credit card. I told him I could only send {$1000.00} a day on XXXX, so he told me to send {$1000.00} a day until I had paid back the {$3500.00} to my son 's account. He said once the funds were all received, it could take up to XXXX business days to get back into the right account.

I have cried over the phone, and in the branch, and become hysterical and been snickered atm blocked from my account because I refused to give MORE personal information over the phone to Wells Fargo and I still have recevied NO resolve for almost 3 weeks now. The Branch manager at one of the branches says he filed a complaint for the way I have been treated and forwarded my case to Escalation, but nothing has been done. Wells Fargo has taken my last 2 paychecks and I still owe over {$400.00}. I keep being told to give them 10 days but it keeps getting stretched out! I can not get answers to exactly what happened but they way my son and I have gathered is that this scammer somehow took posession of his accounts and stole the initial {$3500.00} I sent to MY SON.

XX/XX/2022 Dear XXXX, In response to your investigation conducted over the past couple of weeks regarding the international wire fraud of {$60000.00}, my comments are as follows : -I reported this wire fraud within an hour of the occurrence by calling the Wells Fargo XXXX branch manager and requesting a Swift recall. 
-I was told that a recall had been initiated and that Wells Fargo would involve the FBI as part of the process. 
-I put a hold on my accounts the same day, XX/XX/2022, Ref. # XXXX -The next day, XX/XX/2022, I went to the Wells Fargo XXXX branch and met with XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX They assured me the wire recall was being escalated and that the Fraud Team was on it. 
-On XX/XX/2022, we changed all my accounts, opening new accounts and closing the old ones. 
-I began changing all my other personal accounts and changing usernames and passwords. 

Then, I waited, checking each day for updates. A case number was issued XXXX I did receive a couple of messages, telling me that Wells Fargo was investigating. You also sent me a message stating that a response would arrive by XX/XX/2022. But then, I received another message from you, requesting more time and your response would come on XX/XX/2022. 

When I read your email response on XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/2022, I was stunned. 
You stated, "" That due to a high volume of fraud cases, a recall wasn't sent until XX/XX/2022. '' This is totally unacceptable. According to your response, the FBI was not involved at all. I am extremely disappointed by Wells Fargos lack of performance, on my behalf. 

I have returned to the Wells Fargo XXXX team and expressed my dismay at the entire process. I am considering action against the bank for inadequate action and performance.

The last code was to authorize a XXXX Transfer for {$1000.00}, I noticed the text and notified the person on the phone but was assured that it was a part of canceling a charge. I have since contacted my bank to explain the situation.

After opening the dispute with Wells Fargo nothing was achieved and the case was closed shortly after it was opened. I attempted to call the Wells Fargo service but was told that there was nothing that could be done regarding the refund.

The individual ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ( XXXX ) XXXX then unregistered his account from XXXX which is visible from my mobil app, resulting in my claim being denied, since the account was closed before funds could be recaptured and I was denied reimbursement.

2753,"I experienced wire fraud ( in the form of a spoofed email appearing to be from my real estate attorney ) during the closing of our new home. A wire ( for approximately {$280000.00} ) was sent from our bank account at XXXX to Wells Fargo where it was flagged as potential fraud ( wire beneficiary name did not match the receiving account name ). Without confirmation or verification from me, both banks released the funds and WF then allowed those funds to be withdrawn. Investigations at both banks claimed that they were not at fault and each blamed each other for the wrongdoing. I feel that both banks have failed in their responsibilities, not only in protecting their clients assets but in following the law. XXXX claims to have investigated and found they weren't at fault. Wells Fargo claims that they can rely on XXXX Article XXXX to absolve them of their responsibility because it governs automated wires. Unfortunately because Wells Fargo flagged the potential fraud to XXXX, this wire was not fully automated and human intervention was required, negating their shield of the XXXX. 

I believe that Wells Fargo is culpable for opening a fraudulent account to receive these funds. So either they didn't follow bank protocols to regulate ( employing XXXX, XXXX and proper due diligence requirements ) or it was an inside job. I'd like a full investigation as to what happened.

2755,"To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XX/XX/2022 Wells Fargo Bank XXXX : XXXX XXXX. 
Executive Office Case Specialist From : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Alabama XXXX Re : Complaint : XXXX Page 1 of 3 Dear XXXX XXXX XXXX I would like to formally address and follow up to your response dated XX/XX/2022 with regard to CFPB complaint # XXXX. These are as Follows : 1. You are correct in asserting that I gave you signed authorization XX/XX/2022, and add I paid your firm a fee to complete a wire transfer on my behalf in the amount of {$11000.00}. However please note the following conversation with XXXX XXXX regarding this transaction : At the time of transfer my Banking professional XXXX XXXXWells Fargo in XXXX Alabama was asked to place a 48 hour hold on the funds- to prevent the funds being withdrawn prematurely to allow my wife and I time to drive to XXXX Wisconsin to verify vehicle was as represented. 

XXXX XXXX said Wells Fargo cant do that. I asked if he could verify the recipient banking info and he said he could not do that either. XXXX XXXX noted the paperwork for the funds to be transmitted looked legit. 
XXXX XXXX added if a recall was needed it would need to be done within a couple of hours after the wire transfer had been sent, On XX/XX/2022, XXXXXXXX XXXX we contacted our Branch and spoke to XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo and advised him we had been scammed out of the funds of the wire transfer. XXXX XXXX said he could do nothing and asked we call the number on the back of our debit cards to report Fraud. 

XXXX XXXX in just a little over 24 hours from the time of the initial transfer we notified our branch bank in XXXX Alabama XXXX XXXX XXXX. He failed to initiate and report fraud or act to recall the funds immediate. Instead referring us to a phone number. 

Wells Fargo direction to report Fraud should be and should have been for the Consumer to go to the nearest branch and have a banker file the complaint of fraud. See the attached Wells Fargo publication titled WFFraudinfo and note the number to report fraud. You can not report fraud to anyone at this number. 

As an FYI on XX/XX/XXXX, We were out of state and drove to the a Wells Fargo branch in XXXX Illinois seeking to report Fraud only to find out it was a Wells Fargo Advisers branch. The receptionist gave us a printout of a Wells Fargo branch in XXXX Iowa. We arrived there shortly after XXXX and XXXX XXXX assisted us. Even for her to report a fraud was difficult the numerous transfers disconnect and being placed on hold with time ticking away time was unbearable for me. 

And afterwards she said they will try recall the funds and would I agree to pay the fees for doing so? I agreed. 

XXXX XXXX This was late Friday XX/XX/2022, and Monday was XXXX Day. The attempt to recall the funds was made after XXXX Day. 
Never once has Wells Fargo initiated an investigation or a review of this scam or fraud. 

Here are my questions for Wells Fargo Bank Loss Prevention Departments and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

1. Why isnt it the responsibility of Wells Fargo Bank to investigate fraud committed in wire transfers when notified an act of fraud has occurred? 

2. Regarding Wire Transfers using Wells Fargo and XXXX means and methods to conduct wire transfer service for bank customers and being paid for their services : is this a blind process with no controls or failsafe to combat or minimize fraud? 

3. Wells Fargo Fraud reporting phone number is false information. A consumer can not report fraud to Wells Fargo thru this means of communication. If, it is required to go to the nearest branch and a banker to assist in reporting fraud : XXXX XXXX our banker should be advising us of such to save valuable time. 

Opinion : I believe Banking Institutions have a responsibility to work together to safeguard wire transfers, investigate and prevent FRAUD. They have branches and locations all over the county and working together to protect their customers interests. And if it is not their responsibility to protect their customers and investigate fraud committed using their means and methods something needs to change, 2. When doing wire transfers time of the essence in most cases involving purchases. Why cant a consumer place a hold on funds or detail instructions of dispersal as part of the wire transfer transaction? Common sense dictates allowing holds and ( or ) instructions related to a wire transaction would eliminate or reduce fraud in which the consumer needs time to vet a purchase to safeguard their funds. 
Banking Institutions have much more resources than their consumers to investigate and fight fraud than the consumer. 

Update involving Fraud : The following information is being provided to Wells Fargo Bank to validate the fact that Wire Transfer Fraud has occurred. Working with the XXXX XXXX Sheriffs Office located in XXXX Alabama XXXX. 
Lead Detective XXXX XXXX Case # XXXX. The District Attorney in XXXX has issued a warrant for the arrest ( No Holds ) for an XXXXYear-Old Female in the XXXX Texas area. 
She has been positively identified using XXXX Bank video surveillance footage as the person who made the withdrawal of the funds transmitted via wire transfer whose origination at Wells Fargo Branch Location in XXXX, Alabama to a XXXX Bank location in XXXX, Wisconsin. The withdrawal took place in XXXX Texas. 

In closing, Wells Fargo and XXXX Bank are at fault. Wire Transfers from XXXX Bank institution to Another Banking Institution should be safe. Because of their means and methods and or lack of controls designed to minimize fraud. I have been harmed financially. 

I believe it is only fair that I be compensated for this transaction of {$11000.00} and XXXX Bank and Wells Fargo be held accountable for paying it back to me. 

While the amount in questions may seem small to these 2 banking institutions it represents a year of my life as a retired XXXX YO XXXX Veteran. And I now know and understand Wells Fargo Bank failed to act when being notified of fraudulent act committed against me. 

XXXX Bank and Wells Fargo should pick up this investigation and see it through until and prosecute those responsible for committing wire fraud using the banking systems of these 2 Companies. 
In so doing they will know who the culprits are that abuse their system and possibly uncover flaws in the services and their practices to safeguard assets for all American Consumers.

2761,"I contacted Wells Fargo around XX/XX/2022 regarding a XXXX payment made where I did not receive the product/goods I paid for. I paid {$160.00} for XXXX XXXX tickets and did not receive the tickets. The person kept stalling and then asked for more money so I asked for the {$160.00} back. I have screenshots asking for money back. I was told that there was nothing WF could do. The complaint was referred to a special team and I was told I would be contacted in 10 days and I called them. They did not contact me, return any calls and all of a sudden I receive another letter stating the matter was closed. I requested the documents used to make the decision and was told I would receive in 30 days and to date I have not received anything.

2762,"On XX/XX/2022, I had received a text alert appearing to be from the Wells Fargo app asking if I had made a transfer of {$3500.00} using the XXXX feature via the Wells Fargo app. I replied "" NO '' to the text alert and immediately received a phone call displaying the phone number of the Wells Fargo customer service line as featured on the back of my debit card. I spoke with an individual claiming to be a Wells Fargo customer service representative returning a courtesy call regarding the text alert. I informed them that I did not use the XXXX feature, I did not know the individual whose name the funds were sent to, nor did I even have the funds to cover such a transaction. I was then walked through the steps to "" reverse '' the transfer and put the money back into my account. He then gave me a claim number and a waiting period that they would contact me. After ending this call and waiting for the supposed call-back for about an hour, I decided to call Wells Fargo customer service and check on the status of the claim and make sure my account was safe. This is then when I found out I was scammed. I was never aware that it was possible for an outside individual to pose as my bank even down to the phone number that shows up and the text alerts, this is what lead me to believe this was a legitimate phone call and ultimately into being scammed. When I called Wells Fargo customer service myself, a claim was filed, and all these details were relayed to them. I was told to give up to 10 business days for this issue to be worked on. I then received a letter on XX/XX/2022, stating the claim investigation was complete and was closed. The funds were never returned to my account. I contacted Wells Fargo immediately and was eventually told that I would not be getting my money back because I was "" a victim of scam and authorized the transaction, and they do not cover it ''. I did not have the {$3500.00} amount that was attempted to be taken from me, so only {$1000.00} was taken. That is still not acceptable to me. I feel the bank DOES OWE me my funds. I was not aware that I was being scammed, so how can this be my fault and I lose money that I worked for and was trying to save back. It is not fair treatment of their customers. All they have done in this whole stressful process is make me feel dismissed and XXXX"

I was also issued a new debit card. Wellfargo issued another piece of mail stating me account statement which is is $ XXXX, with no funds returned.

2765,"I was looking for a summer XXXX and found a XXXX XXXX XXXX offered by them. That happened on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, they sent me an interview invitation. Since it was a remote XXXX, they asked me to contact HR- XXXX, the person I get with, through a website "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' ( it is a XXXX website ), and it is possible to search XXXX by entering "" XXXX '' on XXXX website. Everything went well until that person interviewed me. 

After the interview, XXXX told me I was confirmed qualified for the open position. However, he asked me to pay for the training material while the finance department sent me a check through email ( the email above ). I made the payment through XXXX on my mobile bank APP. There were two receivers. One of them was XXXX XXXX with the email address XXXX and phone number XXXX XXXX XXXX ; the other person was XXXX XXXX with the email address XXXX. I made {$1800.00} to XXXX XXXX, and the payment to XXXX failed. The check they sent to me was {$1900.00}. In next day, XXXX notified me that some updated equipment was added to the training materials and asked me to pay another {$1400.00} to XXXX XXXX. They did not send me a check at once. Instead, they said they would send the physical check and training materials on XX/XX/XXXX. At that point, I recognized it was a fraud, so I contacted my bank 's customer service and made claims for all the above transactions. On XX/XX/XXXX, which is today, I did not receive anything from them ; instead, XXXX still wanted me to pay {$1500.00}, so they could mail the training materials and check to me. I told XXXX that my bank account had been closed ( It is not closed, but it will be closed on XX/XX/XXXX since the bank recognized the {$1900.00} check was a scam ), and no one could access my bank account, even bankers. Then, XXXX said, "" [ I am ] advised to proceed to make payment of XXXX or partial payment right away ... Failure to comply, [ my offer ] will be canceled immediately. '' I did not and would not comply. 

Eventually, I transferred {$3300.00}, and the second payment is still pending. However, my bank can not stop the transaction ; instead, they made claims for all of those transactions."
2766,"On XX/XX/2022, I was the victim of a scam involving XXXX and Wells Fargo. I received a call from the "" bank '' inquiring if I had made any purchases in Florida ( I live in SC ). "" No. '' The phone number on my screen for the call was the Wells Fargo customer service number, as verified when I called that number later. XXXX, the scam guy, sent me a code, which I repeated back to him. From what I've been told, when he received that code, he was able to change my password and get into my account. He told me that he also saw payments made through XXXX, drafted out of my savings account, and did I make those. "" No. '' The payments were in the amounts of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, which pretty much wiped out my savings account. 

XXXX said that if I called the recipients and asked them to transfer the money back to my account, they would not be caught up in the fraud investigation and I would have my money back. Sounded good to me, so I called each one. XXXX stayed on the line during the process and was very interested in the code that is sent to the recipient verifying the transfer. 

XXXX, who got the XXXX, wasn't familiar with the transfer process so she was only able to transfer XXXX back to "" my '' account ( the money went to the scammer, not me ). After everyone had transferred the money, XXXX told me that he had ordered a replacement debit card and it would be expedited and would arrive the next day. He also said that everything was taken care of with the account and not to worry, and don't worry if I get any notifications from the bank. Okay, call ended. 

Within about a half hour, XXXX called me, saying that the "" bank '' had called her, telling her that she still needed to transfer the remaining XXXX. She got suspicious, hung up on them, and called me. I knew that was trouble, so I called the bank number ( which was the same one XXXX had called me on ) and reported this fraud scam to them. They did the same thing that XXXX did, sent the code and all. They were able to see that that activity had taken place on my account and said it was very suspicious and I should report it as fraud. I filed a complaint with their loss prevention department ( case # XXXX ). They said they would get back to me after investigating the claim. I ordered a new debit card and ended the call. 

We also filed a police report with the XXXX XXXX Sheriff 's Office ( case # XXXX ) and have been informed an investigation will proceed. If you need a copy of this report, I can provide it to you. 

We received a letter from Wells Fargo denying the claim because I had authorized the transfer. I understand Wells Fargo and XXXX both have language protecting them from liability if a transfer is authorized. 

I was very upset and surprised with this news, as I have been made whole on other fraudulent activity on my account in the past. I phoned the bank again and filed an "" executive complaint '' with them ( XXXX ) and they said they would do further investigation and someone would contact me within 10 days, but I have not heard from them yet. That claim was filed last week. 

I got a call from XXXX today letting me know that XXXX had been sent as a reverse payment regarding the payment she had made to me. That deposit into her account was on XX/XX/XXXX. She is concerned about her account and using it, but she wrote me a check for the XXXX to reimburse me. I called the other two recipients and they did not have any reverse payments into their account. I plan to call the bank today to inquire about this. 

I did some research online and I understand that under your guidelines there is a Regulation E, and that there is protection for a token error, or incorrect electronic fund transfer, as defined in Section 1005.11 ( a ) 1 ) ( iii ). ( hope I got that right ) when the transfer is authorized as part of a scam. 

The lady I talked to at your agency said that you would follow up with this complaint. You have my email address, so I guess that's how I will hear from you. I'd be happy to provide my phone number if you want it. 

At this point, this is all the information I have. I look forward to hearing from you to help me resolve this issue. Thanks."

2768,"Wells Fargos position that the consumer authorized the fraud and is therefore not a victim deserving protections of the EFTA and Regulation E are also incorrect. The CFPB states that if a third-party, here XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, fraudulently induced a consumer into an EFT transfer, the transaction would fall under Regulation Es definition of an unauthorized EFT. CFPB Guidance, Error Resolution, XXXX ( citing Comment XXXX ( m ) -3 ). 
To put a fine point on the issue, the CFPB states that a consumers negligence when determining liability for unauthorized EFTs under Regulation E may not be considered. Similarly, the FDIC makes it clear that the EFTA applies even if the customer is tricked into the fraud. See FDIC Guidance, Consumer Compliance Supervisory Highlights ( XX/XX/2022 ). 
FDIC states : The regulations Official Interpretations expressly state that an unauthorized EFT includes a transfer initiated by a person who obtained the access device from the consumer through fraud or robbery, and that consumer negligence can not be used as the basis for imposing greater liability than is permitted under Regulation E .... 
When an MPP [ money payment platform ] entered into an agreement with a consumer, that agreement extended to the financial institution holding the consumers account. The financial institution, as the account holding institution, was held responsible under Regulation E. In addition, the MPP XXXX through whose platform the EFT was made, was also held responsible, as it was considered a financial institution under Regulation E. Both the financial institution and MPP have investigative and error resolution obligations under Regulation E and must comply with those obligations provided the consumer gives timely notice of an alleged error under section 1005.11 ( b ) .... Regulation E also applies to peer-to-peer or P2P payments made through MPPs .... Consequently, an MPP must comply with Regulation E for transactions connected to a consumers debit card or account. Both the financial institution and MPP are obligated under Regulation E to investigate EFT disputes and to limit consumer liability if, after investigation, the consumers allegations are confirmed. 

On XX/XX/2022, I received a call from the XXXX XXXX police department ( came from that phone number XXXX ) and the person left me a voicemail saying he was sergeant XXXX XXXX with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and needed to speak with me regarding an ongoing case.

I called back and left a voicemail and he then returned my call and said I had jury duty that I didn't show up for and therefore was being given XXXX citations. He provided citation numbers ( fpa # XXXX and XXXX  # XXXX ) and told me that I needed to pay these fines ( total of {$3000.00} ) and meet with a judge in order for it to not remain on my record OR I can have it remain on my record. He provided me with my FD posting # XXXX and then told me that payments will be sent to an Officer in the Treasury Department, XXXX XXXX and an email address to send payments through XXXX ( XXXX ). He said once payment is received, I will receive a notification and be transferred to his receptionist to set up a court date with the judge via XXXX. I sent {$1500.00} and he said he hadn't received it and asked me to send it again but with different info in the "" memo '' and once he receives that, I will be forwarded to his receptionist to set up the XXXX  call. Once BOTH payments went through, he hung up. I have contacted my bank, Wells Fargo numerous times and opened up a case with them but they closed the case saying that there was no issue with the payment and it couldn't be reversed. I argued that the issue was that it was a scam and the money was sent fraudulently!! I have tried requesting a refund through XXXX but now the recipient is no longer registered with XXXX."

I did that and they said they would send me a letter about the case in 10 business days. Around XX/XX/XXXX or so ( I don't know when because I had left the country by then ), a letter arrived to my father 's house, which is my address on file with the bank, stating that they had closed the case and would not be refunding the money because I had authorized the transactions. I called back to ask about how to appeal and they shut down access to my online account and I can only do reactivate it by going into the nearest branch. I live and work in XXXX so was not able to do that. They sent me to an international branch that was 2 hours from my home, but that branch no longer existed when I made the trip to that branch. I called back and again said I had to go to a local branch. When I explained I couldn't, they told me I can have my dad who is a co-owner of my account go into a local branch to do that. I asked my dad to do that for me, and when he went to the branch, he was told they couldn't help him. I called the fraud department back and after much "" communication '', they finally allowed me to verify my identity through the phone through a series of questions that only I could know.

This really doesn't show their complaints department in a good light, to say the least ; and certainly, does not contribute to my overall satisfaction and peace of mind. My complaint is against the bank that did not do its job properly ( could not prevent/foreseen fraud and could not conduct a proper investigation ) and not against the vulnerable customer who fell victim and lost all the savings due to the misconduct of the bank. I feel very distressed and cheated, all because no one acted immediately and practice their duty of care, therefore I only request what I believe to be rightfully mine, as all institutions were more than negligent in protecting my account and handling the complaints.

The FDIC states that the EFTA applies notwithstanding that the customer is tricked into fraud.

Given the clarification from the CFPB and the FDIC, it is clear that even though I was fraudulently induced into submitting the XXXX transactions, I am still protected under the CFPB and FDIC since I was a victim of fraud.

2807,"On XX/XX/22 we noticed that {$18000.00} had been removed from my savings account at Wells Fargo. My wife 's phone was hacked somehow. These funds were transferred via bank wire without our knowledge or or authorization by us. We recognized this quickly and contacted Wells Fargo immediately that same day. We froze our savings and checking accounts for fear additional funds would be stolen. After filing a claim report with Wells Fargo online we went into the Wells Fargo Branch ( XX/XX/22 ) in XXXX XXXX, CA and spoke with a banker. The banker mentioned the wire fraud was under investigation and that this process can take some time as they have to first try and recall the wired funds from the receiving bank. If those funds could not be recalled Wells Fargo would reimburse us per insurance. We followed up once a week and each time they would only advise that the claim was still under investigation with no updates. I finally received a letter from Wells Fargo in the mail on XX/XX/22 claiming their investigation has concluded and that the online wire transaction we disputed would not be covered by Wells Fargo. They claim we can not be refunded due to their Online Wire terms and conditions, Online access agreement and deposit account agreement. We did not release any sensitive information or provide authorization to any third party nor have any knowledge of the fraudulent wire itself. In my entire time with Wells Fargo which has been nearly 20 years I have made 1 wire in person. Why was $ XXXX not flagged or shown as suspicious activity in my account?"
2809,Hello In XX/XX/2022 there was XXXX fraudulent charges done through XXXX XXXX. My bank account was wiped out. {$3600.00} to be more precise. The XXXX transactions were all done in a matter of minutes and Wells Fargo bank called me to try to put an end to transactions but the account had already been wiped out within a matter of minutes. Wells Fargo has denied my claim simply because its XXXX wallet that was used. This is inexcusable and ridiculous that my bank Wells Fargo is trying to just brush it off like nothing happened. {$3600.00} is money I had been saving for a long time now. And its gone just like that. I have been with Wells Fargo for many years and have never needed them for anything until now. Wells Fargo is really trying to brush this off to the side but I refused to let this injustice just slide. Please help me

2813,"On XX/XX/2022, my phone was stolen in XXXX, my phone was pass code protected, yet the person/persons who stole my phone were able to unlock it and get into my online banking and digital wallet. I was not aware of the transactions that were being made on my device, nor did I authorize anyone to make those transactions, I had only become aware of the unauthorized activity when an individual who I was traveling with, received a call from my wife, stating that she had received some calls from our family and friends that I was texting them that I was in trouble and needed them to send me money via XXXX XXXX At that time my wife checked our accounts and noticed the strange activity on our accounts, so she proceeded to call Wells Fargo online and alerted them and opened a claim. When I was made aware I called Wells Faro Online and had them deactivate my online banking and freeze my accounts. I filed a police report with the XXXX Police Department on XXXX XXXX. They used my digital debit card that was on my phone, they transferred money from my online savings into my two different checking accounts, they created a new digital card from a checking account that was never linked to my phone, and they added 2 new XXXX contacts and transferred money with XXXX. I have filed multiple claims with Wells Fargo, have gone into ( 2 ) Wells Fargo branches and had a banker call and help me dispute the claims, I faxed over the police report and did not receive confirmation that it was received, I have called numerous times and I am not able to speak to whomever is handling my claims. I just received letters stating that my claims were denied. I filed a claim with an executive and I never received a call only an email that my claim was denied. Only XX/XX/XXXX I received an email that one of claims was approved that a mistake had been made and it was reversed, I called about my other claims, yet I was told there were denied. 
All this was done without my authorization, knowledge, and by someone I do not know. Below is a summary what was done on my accounts : 1. ( 2 ) online transfers between my accounts one for {$5000.00} and one for {$6000.00} 2. 28 transactions using my digital debit card that was linked to my everyday checking account, of the 28 transactions 16 went through for a total of {$4900.00}. This claim is being denied. A part of this claim is a charge from XXXX that on XX/XX/2022 they determined that it was fraud. I have provided their email and response. 
3. A new digital card was created and a total of 11 transactions were made with all of them going through for a total of {$1000.00}. This claim was approved by the fraud department 4. ( 2 ) new XXXX recipients were added and they sent {$25000.00} to one and {$830.00} to the other. I have not herd back about this claim."
2815,"I received a form answer from my last request. 

I was scammed in a puppy fraud scheme. I contacted my bank. My bank is a partial owner of the company they hide behind as they say 'XXXX  ' is not responsible. I was told when I signed up for XXXX by Wells Fargo service that the service was like XXXX. If there is an issue with XXXX, there is due diligence, fraud protection, and consumer safety from scams.

I was scammed by fraud in a puppy buying scheme.

Banks are supposed to protect consumers from fraud. It's the law. Yet Wells Fargo who is one of the owners of XXXX sends a form letter saying they are not responsible because the consumer was defrauded and hit the button believing fraud. 

I am more than unhappy. This is not protecting the consumers. It's creating a corporation to hide behind and shirk responsibility. I was a victim of a fraud."
2816,"Hi, I'm trying to report a fraud/scam of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I applied to renew my passport this week, and received an email from the XXXX XXXX telling me to contact a phone number in order to complete my application. I called the phone number given to me, and I was told to send them my old passport photo to the XXXX XXXX 's XXXX ( which I later confirmed it's legit ) and I also have to pay {$190.00} as a fee to renew my passport. 

They asked me to pay this amount through XXXX. I asked them if there is a link that I can pay online and they said no. They gave me their XXXX phone number + ( XXXX ) XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) to send the payment to. I confirmed with them that I sent it, and they said my application is complete. I later found out after talking to my friends and did some research that the fee to renew XXXX XXXX passport should only be {$110.00}. They warned me ( even though late ) that this type of corruption is very common in XXXX, and that if I don't pay them the "" extra '' they would delay my renewal process or make it hard for me to renew. I tried to call the XXXX number again but they didn't pick up. 

Basically, they made me pay {$190.00}, {$80.00} more than what I needed to pay to their personal XXXX account, so they can use that to pay for my application and pocket the difference. I doubt I'm the only one that fell for this trick. I contacted WellsFargo, my bank, that I sent money from, but I'm not sure if they could do anything about it. Since the number I called ( XXXX ) was indeed the XXXX XXXX 's phone number, I hope they recorded my calls to show that the employee here overcharged me for my application and they definitely did the same to many other applicants. I respectfully request you investigate in this matter and eliminate this corruption practice. Best."

2826,"I was job scammed over the course of a week by people claiming to be who they were not on XXXX I was offered a job interview on Monday XX/XX/XXXX as an XXXX XXXX in the video game industry. Over the week we had a legitimate and industry specific phone interview with multiple people. I was offered a job and filled out company pdf 's including my direct deposit info and home address. I was ultimately scammed out of {$1000.00} via XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to a fake XXXX for a job required XXXX. I was told the company would expense XXXX transfer after being given an invoice from a real vendor, but I didn't know the recipient address for the payment was a scammer 's account "" XXXX XXXX ''. I was then harassed a little after I asked the imposters to do a video call, and ultimately blocked by them. 


Wells Fargo Bank told me they could not reverse this transfer despite me opening up 2 claims with them and explaining in great detail the scam/fraud. I had also called immediately after the scam to report it as to not waste any time."
2827,"I received a phone call from a suspected wells fargo customer service employee saying that someone was trying to access my credit card information. He then proceeded to tell me we need to perform a test in order to make sure money was not taken. He then had me make an account to wire money. He provided me with the account number and routing number to make my profile active. He had me wire {$4500.00} from my credit card to my savings account. He then mentioned that the money that was wired would be put back in my credit card as a deposit that next day and it did not. From my savings account it went into a XXXX XXXX XXXX account which I do not have an account with. That {$4500.00} went into his account. 

An open invesitgation was performed by Wells Fargo online customer service. However the case has been denied. I received a letter in the mail stating, "" Our research of the online transaction listed shows that it was requested through a secure online banking session using your username and password. In addition, we found that the transaction was completed using a One Time passcode which was sent to our phone. After reviewing information available to us regarding this, we have determined that the transaction was authorized by you, or by someone who had your authorization ''. This statement is not okay. The guy scammed me into moving money from my credit card to savings account and then from my savings went into his account. In order for him to perform this "" test '' he had me log in using my information, he had me verify it was me by sending me a passcode and proceeding on with the scam. He called me from a wells fargo customer service number, I thought it was my bank doing this. It was not however. He then also had me set up a wire transfer profile relaying an account and routing number that I had no idea what it was for. There is no reason for me to ever wire money. Especially for {$4500.00}. No bills I have are this much. I know the money went to this man because on my statement for my savings account it shows that money went into a XXXX XXXX XXXX account, which I never had! This investigation should not have been denied and closed. Wells Fargo did not dig into my savings account apparently. On my statement it shows {$4500.00} into a XXXX XXXX XXXX account and I do not own a chase account. I use my credit card for emergencies."
2828,"We are the victims of a fraud that resulted in a loss of {$75000.00} that were transferred into a fraudulent account at Wells Fargo.

We wired the money ( {$75000.00} ) on XX/XX/2022 and then asked our contact if they received the money, which they did not. We then realized the account details provided for the wire were a scam and that the company 's ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) email was hacked and we were sent details of a fraud account. We reported this to our bank XXXX and contacted Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2022. 

Even after several attempts of recalls done by XXXX bank by having their fraud department contacting the fraud department at Wells Fargo, we didnt receive any clear information. The only response that was provided is : Unfortunately, there are no funds available so they regret they are unable to return the payment as requested. Recalls are best effort basis but we can not guarantee the funds will be returned. The beneficiary bank will follow their own process in an attempt to return the funds. 

We do not know if the fraudulent account holder withdrew the funds, when, or if Wells Fargo were able to flag this transaction and freeze the fraudulent account. We do not know if Wells Fargo are investigating this and what is the timeline for returning out funds.

'' They have done 2 investigations and told me XXXX 's is "" holding '' the funds and they have asked for a return of the funds to my account. To date, this has not happened. I spoke with them again today and I got the same answer, a waiting game. They told me that they have to send an electronic request to pull back the funds. I suggested that a Wells Fargo banker call a banker at XXXX and resolve the issue. Why can't they call... it could be resolved in 5 minutes. This issue has been ongoing for months with no resolution. The Wells Fargo representatives keep giving me the same answer and not taking any action. In addition, I always have to call to get an update. They don't call...

So I did via Wells Fargo to XXXX. He then sent me a fraudulent airplane ticket through another puppy servicer for airplane rides. It was saying the crate was not approved and I needed to pay more for a new one. When I asked about this he said the puppy was at the airport waiting to picked up but I needed to pay more for a new crate. I did not though because I called the actual company and they said it was a known scam. 

This is so much money lost. And Wells Fargo is refusing to help me and im so heartbroken over this. Ive been with this bank for a decade and this one mistake I made they wont help me with. Please help me recover these lost funds. I was truly scammed. You have all the info above and can see for yourself if you contact him. Plus the pictures of the puppies never change.

2835,"On XX/XX/2022, I was a victim of a phishing email scam. 

The email came from what looked like XXXX. The email was : XXXX In the email they sent an invoice of {$500.00} I bought in bitcoin. I have never bought XXXX. So I called the number at XXXX to dispute the transaction. 

The other person on the line was incredibly professional and convincing. He claimed the charge came from an IP address in Texas. I have no association with Texas. 

I was in a panic and not thinking straight. This was a lot of money. So I did whatever this very professional, reassuring voice on the other end of the phone told me to do. 

They wanted to verify my IP address by sending money through XXXX. This was to assure my IP address and somehow catch the other person. 

I understand it makes little sense but at the time I was not thinking straight. They assured me the money was going to come to me instantly again from their manager, XXXX XXXX. 

I ended up sending XXXX transactions to them. XXXX for {$1300.00}, and another for {$1300.00}. 

The money was taken right away. They hung up and that was it. 

I rushed to my nearest Wells Fargo bank and explained everything. I filed a complaint and got all new accounts. 

Yesterday Wells Fargo closed their claim stating that they have provided all the information I gave to the bank institution I sent the money to through XXXX. It is now up to that institution to decide to give me back the money or not. 

Wells Fargo says they can not do anything at all and that I am to the mercy of this other bank. They will not provide the other bank for me to follow up because its against security protocols. 

Nearly {$3000.00} is gone and I have no one to go to for help now. I have no answers. My bank Wells Fargo has given up on me. 

I understand that they have no way to get the money back and to refund me, but it just seems irresponsible of all these banks to not have any security measures to cancel or hold these transactions. I alerted my bank nearly 20 minutes after this happened during banking hours and it seems like absolutely nothing was done. 

I dont know what Im asking for, I dont know how this money will ever be given back. I fear I must accept that it is gone. 

Though I know I am not the only one who has gone through this. Not the first, certainly not the last. 

I just want my story to be noted so that we can hold either the banks or XXXX itself responsible for these scams on the innocent. Maybe somehow through your interference you can help me get more answers. 

I forgot to mention that the scammer called me the next day with the number XXXX claiming they were still from XXXX. I hung up and blocked them immediately. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this."

Upon getting to Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX greeted and helped me at his desk. He allowed me to make this transfer back to XXXX XXXX WITHOUT ever checking my 40+ years of banking history and following protocol to protect their XXXX customers. My daughter went to speak with XXXX personally on XX/XX/XXXX, and ADMITTED to seeing all the red flags with this transaction but STILL failed to protect his customer and allowed the wire transfer to be completed to a bank in XXXX.

I was scammed for {$2200.00} in total from across three transactions through XXXX on the Wells Fargo app. I did this because I thought it was a good decision since I am in need of money in order to pay for College expenses. I have contacted my bank Wells Fargo about the situation. They have sent out three different transaction claims but have got back no money. They have also sent out three requests towards the other institution where my money got sent and currently awaiting a response.

She offered to pay via credit card but they explained that in this situation where disconnect was in process they could only take XXXX.

They then proceeded to explain that they payment was not accepted because the system was not taking in to account the removal of the late payment, she she processed another payment for the {$310.00}. They walked her through how to request credit through XXXX for the refund of the first amount and said just to round it up to {$290.00}. They then stated service would be restored and put her on hold to confirm with supervisor. A few days later, after refund did not process through as a refund, she reached out to XXXX XXXX to learn that they never accept payments through XXXX.

2857,"Through my bank, XXXX, and via XXXX, I sent XXXX, to my brother for medical reasons. I sent XXXX for three months straight, to help him. He just had his XXXX XXXX and lives alone. 

It was totally my error! 
I sent the money to a man in Florida because his phone number was one digit off from my brother 's. 

I understand XXXX can not refund my money because I made the mistake. 

However, when I contacted the gentleman in Florida who's phone number is similar to my brother 's, he returned my money to his Wells Fargo Bank. Wells Fargo told this gentleman, that it would be returned to me. They gave him a case number and two reference numbers. They did not give him a reference number for the third and final return of the XXXX. 
When he returned the final XXXX, they said this was a fraud case and made him change his account number. 
This statement of fraud confuses me, because nobody is taking money from this gentleman. 

After I first spoke to the recipient of my money, I made a report with my XXXX bank. This report should still be on file. 

Next, I went to Wells Fargo with the case number and reference numbers, to see if they could tell me where my money is. I asked them, when will I receive my money? 

Wells Fargo said, they can't look up the case number, because my identity can't be proven. 
I offered to give them my bank information, my social security number, driver 's license, and/or my birth certificate. They said sorry, we can't help you. 

I went back to my XXXX bank to see if they could assist me. 
They said they can't retrieve my case and reference numbers from Wells Fargo, either. 

Bottom line is, Wells Fargo has my XXXX and I need it back, desperately. Wells Fargo refuses to look up my case number, and find out where my money is. 
I don't know where to turn for help. I'm not going to allow a bank to keep my money. Please help me!

A delayed response again requesting another photo of the XXXX document. I have examined my bank transactions and discovered that the {$490.00} has been paid from my account via XXXX transfer. 
XXXX confirmation code : XXXX. On seat agent for XXXX XXXX XXXX listed as XXXX XXXX. XXXX payment info : XXXX Of note, the aforementioned website in question ( XXXX XXXX appears to have at least XXXX near-identical sister sites called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) having simply exchanged Store for Shop in the case of one and otherwise changed some website colors, banners and fonts. The overall scheme and insistent reliance on XXXX transaction appears to be the exact same. 

Actions taken : Contacted XXXX to report fraud and to attain information for the FBI 's IC3 Form. Zero progress was made with contacting XXXX. An individual can expect zero recourse by contacting XXXX for any situation resembling the above- it is a cul de sac of assistance. Of note, their online 'Report a Scam ' requests a "" 12-digit PaymentID '', instructing the filer to reference their bank statement for this number. The number on my bank statement - confirmed via an agent of my bank- is 10-digits. You MAY NOT submit the form if it does not have exactly 12-digits thus creating a veritable XXXX deadend.

2863,"My minor daughter was contacted by an online scammer, offering to send her money to her bank account if she would XXXX them money according to their indstructions. 

The scammer purportedly deposited {$3500.00} in her Wells Fargo account which the bank said was available to my daughter. 

After she sent {$400.00} via XXXX, the bank then said the deposit was not valid and is forcing my daughter to pay them the {$400.00} even though she relied upon the bank 's representation to indicate the money was available. 

This is not in keeping with bank policy, and besides that, my daughter never opted in to the XXXX system and even if she did, she would be a minor and unable to sign on her own. 

I've tried to resolve this with the bank since XX/XX/2022, the day I discovered the fraud."
2864,"Wells Fargo made a faulty transfer to my bank account. The money was returned and now WF makes it impossible for me to get my money back. I made more than 10 attempts to talk to WF. Every time I talk they give me new information. In the end nothing happens. 
I need you urgent help with this. 
Here are the details : I had a saving account in Wells Fargo Bank. 
On XX/XX/2022, Wells Fargo sent me an e mail saying that this Bank required that all consumer provided a valid primary residential address located within the US or its territories. As I don't live in the US, I decided to close the saving account, because they pointed out a deadline until XX/XX/2022. 
I called Wells Fargo from XXXX, using the phone number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( that calls were charged to my phone receipt, even when they were supposed to be no charge ), and I asked to close my account. They gave options to get my money : to send me a check or to do a wire transfer. I choose the second one to a bank in XXXX, and I called Wells Fargo and gave them next information so they send me the money : Account number in Wells Fargo Name of the Bank of destination ( in XXXX ) Swift code Account number of destination XXXX  key Owner of the account in XXXX ( me ) On XX/XX/XXXX, a Wells Fargo banker called me and verify the information, she let me know that the deadline to have the money in my account in XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX, but maybe too much soon. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email communicating my account was closed. But the money was not in my account. 
I called Wells Fargo many times ( all of them charge to my phone receipt ), and finally they told me I had to ask in the XXXX bank, because as the Wells Fargo account is know closed, and they could not find the money. 
In the XXXX bank they told me Wells Fargo asked for an investigation about that transfer, and they answered them on XX/XX/2022, the money was returned with a transaction number. I called Wells Fargo again, and sent that number, but they just answered : Hello We have contacted to our wire room- Wire still has not been returned and no messages from Beneficiary bank. 
Please contact your bank regarding your wire transfer. 
Thank you Said an Operations Processor, Issue & Inquiry Resolution / Account colusures & Partial Withdrawals What can I do know? 

I just want to have my money."
2870,I noticed a unauthorized wire transfer from my account. I immediately called the fraud number and I filed a complaint. I never received any resolution or information. I called again and received a time wasting run around constantly forwarded to different departments saying they have no information.
2871,"On XX/XX/2022, I was the victim of a telephone Authorized XXXX XXXX  scam perpetrated by criminals posing as my bank, Wells Fargo, who manipulated me into using the online wire transfer system to transfer {$25000.00} to another Wells Fargo account. 
How did the criminals know I had a Wells Fargo account? 
How did the criminals know there was an excess of {$25000.00} in my account? 
Was my account hacked prior to the telephone scam? 
Has Wells Fargo investigated this incident after I reported it on XX/XX/2022? If so, what were the results?"
2872,"I send a domestic wire transfer of {$510.00} from my Wells Fargo account to XXXX XXXX  XXXX on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately, my Wells Fargo account did not indicate that the money had been removed from my account, therefore I made the decision to send another wire because my Wells Fargo app indicated that the wire transfer had failed. My account was charged twice for the same wire the following business day, so I contacted Wells Fargo right away. I spoke with several agents over the course of two hours because no one was able to assist me, so I went in person to the branch. I've been calling for exactly one month, and no one has responded. However, this is intolerable."
2873,"I was scammed through XXXX. I was trying to sell something via XXXX XXXX. The "" buyer '' said he would send money via XXXX. I received several emails claiming to be XXXX customer support saying I need to refund a portion of the transaction since the transaction was too large. I used XXXX through Wells Fargo to follow the email 's instruction to get the transaction to process. I ended up sending {$700.00} via XXXX through Wells Fargo to resolve the issues. I eventually realized it was a scam. The scam emails spoofed XXXX 's customer service branding and I've ran into issues in the past with transfer limits on XXXX which made me susceptible. There was no ability to cancel or terminate the transaction after I realized my mistake. Wells Fargo notified me that the transactions are instant and irreversible."
2875,"I was contacted by Wells Fargo Bank on XX/XX/2022 to alert me that a suspicious transaction ( setting up XXXX XXXX ) had taken place on my business checking account ending in XXXX. I verified that it was not me and WF said they would send out a replacement card. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a text from "" Wells Fargo '' asking if I had authorized a payment to XXXX in South Carolina. I responded "" no ''. Another text arrived asking if I had authorized two XXXX payments and I responded 'no '. You will see in my screen shots attached that I responded "" no '' instead of "" 2 ''. I was panicking because it was such a shock. 

I was immediately contacted on my cell phone by "" Wells Fargo '' and said there had been another transaction ( setting up XXXX XXXX ) on the same account. I was confused since this had just happened the day before but continued the conversation. I explained about being contacted the previous day and she said that a new card hadn't been sent, but a new one would be today. I was then asked about the attempt to charge at a XXXX in South Carolina and replied no, I had not done that. Then, I was asked if I made two XXXX deposits- one for {$1000.00} and one for {$2000.00} to XXXX XXXX. Of course, I hadn't made those either. I was then prompted to reverse the transfer using my mobile XXXX app. A text was sent with a pin number I was to give them for verification. I was given confirmation numbers for both XXXX transfers and a XXXX tracking number for the new card being sent. 

As soon as I hung up, I received a text from Wells Fargo regarding the {$1000.00} XXXX transfer and I was alerted to call their fraud department. I was on hold for 1 hour and 11 minutes. When I finally spoke with a representative, she told me that I had been scammed. Before I could get any more information, the call was disconnected. I called back and was transferred to a number of different departments. I was on the phone for 1 hour and 49 minutes. Finally, a representative was able to help stop the {$1000.00} transfer, the {$2000.00} transfer had already gone through. I couldn't help but think that the extraordinary wait time to speak to an agent contributed to not being able to also stop the {$2000.00} transfer. 
The agent told me a case had been opened and that it would be 7-10 business days for a resolution. 

After 10 days, I called Wells Fargo and was told they were closing the claim and could not do anything. According to Wells Fargo and XXXX, because I "" authorized '' this transfer, I was liable. When I asked if there was anything I could do or if they could offer any suggestions, they said, "" NO ''. I could not believe that their response was that they weren't authorized to provide any suggestions. 

I then filed a claim with my local police department on XX/XX/2022. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Wells Fargo requesting the documentation they used for my case. 

I did more digging and became aware of the Federal Reserve Board 's Regulation E. I believe that my case is covered by this regulation. Question # 5 of the FAQs. If a consumer is fraudulently induced into sharing account access information with a third party, and a third party uses that information to make an EFT from the consumers account, the transfer is an unauthorized EFT under Regulation E In the meantime, I had contacted the XXXX XXXX to report the incident and to shed light on this new, sophisticated scam. I was contacted by a reporter and the story ran on XX/XX/XXXX."
2876,"On the afternoon of XX/XX/2022, while driving home from work, I received a phone call from a caller with the caller id of Wells Fargo. I have been a customer of Wells Fargo for over 17 years, and have received calls from them in the past. 
The caller stated he was with Wells Fargo and asked if I used XXXX. He informed me someone was trying to access my Wells Fargo account via XXXX and asked me to open the Wells Fargo app on my phone and look at prior history. 
I did not see any transactions and he told me I needed to add the person with an Email address to send the money to verify my identity. He assured me Wells Fargo would immediately return the money, but this was the only way to stop the thief from stealing the entirety of my checking account. 
I asked for verification he was with Wells Fargo and he told me to check the number he was calling from, it matched the number on the back of my debit card. He assured me he was with Wells Fargo. He knew my account information, my location, obviously my phone number and email address. He said that XXXX had been taken from my account, and this was the only way to get it back.

Assuming Wells Fargo had protection against scammers, I sent the money. Realizing pretty quickly this was a mistake, I immediately hung up and called Wells Fargo.

I was on this call for 11 minutes, trying to get a Wells Fargo banker to assist me, but I was constantly transferred, had to keep adding my account number, telephone, etc. During this time the scammer called me back 5 times. I was on hold with Wells Fargo, and not knowing I had accepted the scammer 's call. I had been trying to hang up the call. 
The new scammer was a woman, and assured me she was with Wells Fargo fraudulent services, and could see the XXXX was pending to go back into my account. She told me I needed to send XXXX from my savings account, in order to protect it. She said this was the only way to get my XXXX back. 
I sent them money, and immediately called Wells Fargo. This time it took 38 minutes for the person I needed to help me get on the line. Everytime I had to repeat the story, give my account number, etc. 
Apparently the money can not be immediately canceled or returned. I filed a claim with Wells Fargo, and am waiting 10 days. 
I assumed the scammer was with the bank since the app is so easy to use with XXXX, I thought the bank would have fraud protection for this. 
I never signed up for XXXX, it is just attached to my account. I also feel I should have been able to get in contact with someone from Wells Fargo much sooner, and this could have been avoided. 
I just hope more people can be aware of this type of scam."
2879,"I was a victim of fraud and scam scheme where I was deceived and lost {$500.00} via XXXX XXXXy Cash Person-to-Person. Once the transaction occurred the fraudulent merchant blocked me and no further communication could be made with the merchant. Immediately once the transaction was posted to my checking account, I filed a dispute with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo denied my claim stating that the transaction is not fraudulent and upon calling the claims department to obtain more information, I was told that their definition of fraudulent does not match the dictionary definition and does not cover deception or scams. As a result Wells Fargo is not willing to help me with this fraudulent transaction."
2880,"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) XXXX XXXX XXXX Washington, DC XXXX XX/XX/XXXX This is to complain against the Wells Fargo. 
URGENCY : HIGH IMPORTANCE : HIGH [ WITHOUT PREJUDICE ] I wish to practice my right as a customer of Wells Fargo to use your organisation 's service, seeking a formal, impartial investigation to amicably settle my dispute ( Ref : XXXX ) with Wells Fargo. 
In order to clear up the myriad of letters and correspondences I have hitherto sent to Wells Fargo respecting my complaint, I believe it will substantially strengthen both my case and your understanding, by taking a deeper look at the happenings of my case, and analysing the relevant facts in an objective and comprehensive fashion. 
It is crucial to note that I have been manipulated, socially-engineered and coerced to engage these fraudulent criminals. Much to my embarrassment, I recognize that I am the victim of an investment scam. 
My complaint to the CFPB has arisen as I do not consider, by any stretch of the imagination, the conduct of Wells Fargo to be commensurate with their legal role and responsibility to their customers. They sell a service to look after their customers, protect their money and are a financial institution that maintains a traditional relationship and way of working with its customers. 
During the complaints process with Wells Fargo, I found their communication ineffective, which further hides their conduct to management and diminishes the service offering to their clients. 
They are struggling to adapt their business offering in the ever-changing world of IT development. The internet is presenting a real problem which they choose to manage in a way which is not in line with rules and regulations of CFPB as well as their own internal policy and procedures sold to their clients. 
General Obligation : Commencing on or around XX/XX/XXXX, I fell victim to two multi-layered scam operations run by XXXX XXXX XXXX which involved me making deposits for a total amount of XXXX USD from my Wells Fargo account to these fraudulent investment companies. 
When determining whats reasonable and fair, we should focus on the issue of liability ; common queries include, but are not limited to, the following : ( i ) whether Wells Fargo did not take notice of any rule, law, or regulation, and/or possibly missed any material elements of the relevant bylaws or codes of conduct, that may have prevented them from protecting my financial safety ; ( ii ) whether by virtue of Wells Fargos custodianship over my funds or by its control over them, they owed a fiduciary duty to the me and if so, whether that duty was breached ; ( iii ) whether Wells Fargo promoted the transactions in question despite being aware of the nature of the transactions in question ( iv ) whether Wells Fargo was in compliance with its own policies and procedures ; ( v ) whether Wells Fargo owed duties to myself, what the scope of those duties was, and whether Wells Fargo did not uphold those duties ; ( vi ) whether Wells Fargos conduct was unfair ; and ( vii ) whether Wells Fargo has within its power the ability to, and should, compensate me for the harm that has befallen me. 
Upon identification of such unusual or suspicious activity, it is crucial that the relevant staff member adequately describe the factors making an activity or transaction suspicious, thoroughly depict the extent and nature of this activity and properly communicate to the customer that such activity meets the relevant criteria of fraud. 
In providing its services to a customer, a financial institution is required by law to exercise the care and skill of a diligent, prudent organization. In this case, this means that the payment service provider should not turn a XXXX eye to known facts pointing to a real possibility that their customer is being scammed. In other words, Wells Fargo must have had special knowledge of what was occurring or been alerted to a real possibility of fraud taking place. The financial institution must have known or reasonably ought to have known that I was dealing with a scammer. 
Granted, there is room for diversity of view insofar as reasonableness is concerned. Indeed, there is a sense in which the standard of care of the reasonable person involves in its application a subjective element. 
However, it must be remembered that the correct test is always reasonable care in all circumstances, not average care. The fact that most people behave in a certain way may be good evidence that the conduct is reasonable, but this is not necessarily the case. Although reasonableness is a very fluid concept, all of the evidence suggests that Wells Fargo did not foresee the fraud and disregarded even the most obvious dangers in this respect. 
Situations do tend to repeat themselves and it is advisable to examine previous outcomes to see how the standard of the reasonable person should be applied, and that lessons can be learnt from the errors of the past.

Wells Fargos Position : On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo wrote in a letter We understand that you believe you may be a victim of a fraud scheme resulting in you wiring funds to a third party under false circumstances. We will make every attempt to recall a wire if a victim advises us the transaction was associated with a fraud scheme ; however, we can not guarantee we will able to return the full amount from a suspected fraudulent transaction. If there are insufficient funds in the recipients account or if the recipients account is closed at the time the request to recall a wire is made, we may not be able to recover the funds from the recipients account. 
Refuting Wells Fargos arguments from a purely logical perspective : Wells Fargos position is that the features of the situation at hand do not generate a genuine obligation to protect innocent and helpless victims ; they are essentially arguing that commonsense-based approaches are doomed to fail, leaving their exclusively technical account of the subject matter as the only meaningful choice. For reasons which are unclear, this extremely serious situation barely gets the attention it deserves even though ample evidence has been offered in support of this complaint.

In Wells Fargos view, it is implied that we should not home in ( and consequently rely ) on unwritten laws, practicality, good judgement, reasonableness, sharpness, sensibleness, past outcomes, and insight, when taking appropriate precautions. To underscore, once again, such views are at odds with common sense and are wildly irresponsible.

Imagine a view according to which the one and only thing that can make Wells Fargo morally obligated to do something is having it written down somewhere. Pursuant to this view, if Wells Fargo encounter the suffering of totally naive victims, they are only obligated to intervene in or remedy the situation, to the degree required by written material. This is unbecoming for a reputable establishment such as Wells Fargo. 
I have reviewed the material hereto sent by Wells Fargo carefully, and it unfortunately provides no response to my fundamental argument concerning the degree of care. Given its size, influence, and the resources at its disposal, this establishment clearly had a far greater capacity than an individual such as myself had, to determine the level and likelihood of risk that a client such as myself is subjected to and had a duty to intervene as they now do to query in particular out-of-pattern transactions of this kind. 
It is perfectly obvious that Wells Fargo, inadvertently, employs a subtle approach in addressing some of the key questions in a manner which neither provides me with adequate support nor protects anything other than its own interests. 
It is Wells Fargo here, who has the burden of proof, to show that it has exercised the duty of care, that is to say, that Wells Fargo adhered to a standard of reasonable care in relation to the matter at issue given its extensive experience compared to mine. It is Wells Fargo that claims that the damages which I have suffered in connection to this matter have not been reasonably foreseeable, and that my proposed degree of care is not, and has not been, commensurate with Wells Fargos capacity, experience, expertise, or scope of services in any way. To reemphasize, Wells Fargos indisputable overriding purpose is by no means to purely execute transactions in a XXXX and blank fashion, but rather to strike a balance between executing those transactions and capitalizing on its undeniably vast capabilities to protect consumers thereby enhancing market integrity. 
Apropos of the fluidity of the concept of reasonableness, all Wells Fargo has done in this regard is set up a dichotomy of having or not having the legal obligation under consideration, however, that does not go one-inch toward explaining why various regulatory authorities, such as the XXXX, has maintained that financial institutions can, and should, protect consumers using their systems, advanced technologies, and rich experience. 
Wells Fargo is obliged to take some action if it is sufficiently aware of a real possibility that a fraud may be being perpetuated. If you don't question its customers instructions or raise the possibility of a scam with the customer in these circumstances, it may be liable if the red flags indicate the customer is : particularly vulnerable, or if the possibility of fraud was serious or real, not just suspected. 
There are some recommendations to organisations for protecting customers from financial harm that might occur as a result of fraud or financial abuse ; and gives guidance on how to recognise customers who might be at risk, how to assess the potential risks to the individual and how to take the necessary actions to prevent or minimise financial harm. 
These recommendations are established as a general principle, the organisation should deliver a service that : 1 ) Takes a proactive approach to minimising risks, impact and incidences of financial harm and it sets out systems and tools for the prevention and detection of fraud and financial abuse. As a general point, it says organisations should ensure that all systems are developed using technologies and methodologies that are effective in the prevention of fraud and financial abuse, through authorised and unauthorised payments, thereby minimising the risk of financial harm to customers. As regards to the detection of fraud and financial abuse, it says the organisation : A ) should have measures in place across all payment channels and products to detect suspicious transactions or activities that might indicate fraud or financial abuse. It then lists the following examples of suspicious activity on customer accounts : a. multiple cheque books; b. sudden increased spending ; c. transfers to other accounts ; d. multiple password attempts ; e. logins from new devices, multiple geographical locations ; f. sudden changes to the operation of the account ; Unusual transactions are transactions whose amount, characteristics and frequency bear no relation to the economic activity of the customer, exceed normal market parameters or have no apparent legal justification. 
g. a withdrawal or payment for a large amount ; h. a payment or series of payments to a new payee ; i. financial activity that matches a known method of fraud or financial abuse. 
B ) organisations should have a process in place to ensure that staff make contact with the customer to verify the financial activity, challenge its authenticity, explain the nature of the suspected or detected fraud and discuss an appropriate plan of action. 
Wells Fargo are yet to show, or otherwise provide me with, a compelling argument that their wide-ranging experience and wealth of specialist knowledge in detecting transactional anomalies were not sufficient to avert the fraud at issue. By contrast, I have provided a multitude of sound and powerful reasons by which requiring their involvement has not only been pressingly relevant but also eminently reasonable and well-justified. 
Rather than empathizing with and undertaking substantial efforts to convey their knowledge of the existence of such regulations abroad and thereafter use it to protect and proactively relieve the plight of consumers who have been cheated out of their money and whose role in society is properly fulfilled, positively contributing to local economic growth, development and sustainability Wells Fargo adopts a rather insouciant attitude toward my financial predicament portrayed herein. 
I am deeply convinced that the disastrous results that I have previously elaborated upon will continue to ensue if no responsibility is adopted by Wells Fargo in relation to this matter. I have also thoroughly detailed why they can not simply dismiss this problem by strictly adhering to legal technicalities which, after careful reflection, struck me as being nothing more than selfinterest. Indeed, it seems to me utterly unfair to disregard fragile, sensitive, and vulnerable consumers who are afflicted by such allegedly malevolent acts, thereby keeping an unjust status-quo that is corrupting our society at its core. 
Conclusion : Based on my analysis, and as confirmed by various authorities concerned with such matters, there is abundant evidence that forward-thinking financial institutions ought to take reasonable steps to forestall fraud, or at least mitigate its risk by using an effective risk management system, demonstrating their undisputed ability to responsibly and pre-emptively respond to questionable transactions in the digital arena. The use of such systems, largely based on newly adopted technologies aimed at effectively navigating the evolving threat landscape, is only one of a number of possible endeavours undertaken in this connection, alongside the application of past knowledge and experience related to popular fraudulent practices. 
Astonishingly, I am pondering how it is that, despite being shown that Wells Fargos business conduct was insufficient insofar as background checks are concerned, they keep refuting their indisputable role and responsibility in connection with the matter herein discussed. The points that I have hitherto made are too crucial to be taken lightly. Wells Fargos non-observance of the fundamental principles of justice that is, to completely overlook and not even remotely try to mitigate the suffering of vulnerable consumers is inexcusable given the size of the establishment and the vast resources at its disposal as the direct result of the patronage of clients like myself. 
If it was, indeed, solely my responsibility, we must then believe at least one of the following clauses : a ) financial institutions have absolutely no role whatsoever in preventing and detecting fraud, b ) the fraud in question was not reasonably foreseeable, or c ) the transactions in question were not sufficiently alarming. It is extremely unfortunate that Wells Fargo pushes quite hard for me to believe all three of these thingsdespite evidence to the contrary. 
In summary, I respectively ask your organization to consider my points, given your personal and companywide obligation to provide a fair and reasonable investigation into the complaint. 
I look forward to your input and would gladly cooperate to reach a fair and reasonable outcome. 
Thank you."
2882,"I was going through a contentious divorce in XXXX, XXXX. I had to sell my house and my boat. I listed my boat on XXXX XXXX and was able to sell it online to a buyer from out of state, XXXX XXXX. XXXX sent me a Cashiers Check for {$95000.00} written on XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( I have a copy of the cashiers check ). I went into Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX to cash the check and have the money deposited into my checking account. I approached a teller at the Wells Fargo bank located on XXXX XXXX in XXXX, GA. I told the teller that the cashiers check was for a payoff on my boat and that I needed her to check the authenticity of the check to ensure that it was legitimate. She walked away and came back shortly after and verbally confirmed that the check was good. When I asked her when it was safe to wire the payoff for my boat, she said 24 hours. She just stated as long as the money shows in your account tomorrow you can wire the money. I followed her direction to a tee and as I was on my way out of town for business the next day, I stopped at a different branch of Wells Fargo ( Branch # XXXX ) to send two wires. One to XXXX XXXX bank in XXXX, SC four the payoff on the boat and another for {$12000.00} for transportation of my boat since the buyer lived out of state in Kentucky. I conducted the wire transfers and went about my business. 

Twenty four hours later and just before I was to leave for vacation, a large negative balance showed up on my account. I immediately called my bank who redirected me to the Wells Fargo Fraud Division. I called and spoke to XXXX, who immediately started accusing me of wrongdoing. She stated that the check was voided and had void all over the check and verified that this was a fraudulent check. She directly accused me of the fraud. I asked her to stop, explained that all I did was sell my boat on a well known publication, that I received a cashiers check ( certified funds ) and that the teller at the Wells Fargo bank told me was good after I asked her to verify it, and that she said it was completely OK to wire money off the account the next day as long as the money showed in my checking account, which it did. Being a consumer and knowing nothing about the process, I just did as I was instructed by a banking professional. I also asked her why the teller would have stated a cashiers check with a VOID watermark would not have been caught by them and stopped since they are supposed to be trained for this? She had no answer. It was only then that XXXX backed off and stated that she would be my sole contact and that she would work with me to resolve the issue. I had already instructed the lien holder on the boat, XXXX XXXX, to release the title on my boat to the buyer. When I called XXXX XXXX, they confirmed that they had received the payoff from Wells Fargo and released the title to the buyer the day the day before. 

I cancelled my vacation and began trying to help Wells Fargo with the mess they created. I called the XXXX XXXX bank that the cashiers check was drawn on in XXXX, KY and spoke to XXXX XXXX who, within 30 seconds of describing the check verified over the phone that this was not one of their cashiers checks. When I asked him why Wells Fargo didnt verify the check when I asked them to and why they said it was fine to wire money off of my account within 24 hours, he couldnt believe it. He stated that even at their bank there are strict guidelines that must be followed to verify the authenticity of the check and that a wire off of a cashiers check is a minimum of 4 days. He couldnt believe the direction that Wells Fargo had given me, specifically for a check that large. It is important to note that to date, not one individual from Wells Fargo has ever asked for the phone number or any other information from the fraudulent buyer. Due to the aggressive behavior from XXXX in the fraud department, I also called the XXXX XXXX Police department and opened up a complaint against Wells Fargo for giving me bad information, being aggressive with false accusations, and to protect myself for any future aggression from the bank. It took Wells Fargo several days to implement a reverse wire request and they were able to recoup the transportation fee of {$12000.00} transportation fee. Since I still had the boat but the original title was gone, I had to file for a duplicate title with the South Carolina DNR. This took more time and money. I had to take 3 days of PTO at work because Wells Fargo had frozen and then closed my checking account, to open a new checking account, deposit some money into the new account with a different bank, and re-direct my paychecks and all future auto debits to come out of my new account. I also had to cancel a business trip to get this done. I stayed in touch with Wells Fargo and their fraud department as I filed for the duplicate title, re-listed my boat for sale, and waited for further direction from them. I then had a local man want to buy the boat for {$98000.00} but backed out because it now had a duplicate title. I now had to tell people that I had filed for the duplicate title but still had not received it. I eventually called the SC DNR and the woman told me they were backed up on titles for 4-6 months. I explained to her my situation and she kindly processed my duplicate title quickly. With the duplicate title finally in hand, I was able to finally sell the boat for {$75000.00} to a local buyer on the lake. 

I called the fraud department to let them know and I was told to deal directly with the branch manager at the XXXX location where I deposited the cashiers check. His name was XXXX XXXX. I went in to the branch to meet with XXXX at the nd of XXXX or beginning of XXXX and told him that I would work with Wells Fargo to settle my account and would pay them half of the {$75000.00}. This amount equated to the {$75000.00} that I received minus all of my expenses, including the {$23000.00} in lost profit for having a duplicate title instead of the original. It included the costs of my time off and cancelled vacations and business trips, none of which enthused my boss. I felt like splitting the difference was a legitimate and kind offer given what I had gone through at one of the most tumultuous times of my life with a divorce. All because a bank teller didnt do her job on a check for over $ XXXX even though I had specifically asked for her to verify it, which she said she did. My offer put both parties square on expenses and profit, with me having been put through the ringer for weeks fixing their mess. XXXX told me that he didnt have authorization to make the deal but he would call the Fraud Department and ask for approval and he assured me they would get back to me. No one called. Several weeks later I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that they were treating my account as a charge off Credit. There was no mention in the letter of wanting any money back or that they would be in touch further to collect any money. I took this as Wells Fargo doing the right thing since this was 100 % their fault and by now, they had known all of the hoops that I had to jump through. I shortly thereafter retired from my company after 25 years. I went about my business mainly doing volunteer work and playing some golf when I received an attorney letter express delivery from an attorney of Wells Fargo demanding {$73000.00} in 30 days and threatening to sue me. I was absolutely blown away. I called the fraud department and collections department where I relived this nightmare all over again and I asked both for a copy of the charge off credit letter that they refused to send me a copy. All they said was I needed to contact their attorney. I have made two more offers now to try and settle this, including the original {$35000.00} and they have rejected this through my attorney, stating they want the entire {$73000.00}, even though they are 100 % at fault and after I have spent hours and hours on this online and on the phone. All because of their negligent training and lying to me about not only the cashiers check being good, but when it was OK to safely do the wire transfer. My attorney is currently dealing with their attorney and my last offer was {$35000.00} to be paid next spring now that I will be due XXXX final large payment from my company. I am now retired and on a fixed income and Wells Fargo doesnt seem to care. If they had just called me back like XXXX had said they would and not sent me a letter that 100 % made it appear like they were going to do the right thing and take accountability for their multiple mistakes, I would not have retired and then been able to work with them more on a settlement. I am no longer able to do that and even my latest offer of {$35000.00} next spring is going to eat into my retirement income unexpectedly. 

Wells Fargo needs to be held accountable and expunge this {$73000.00} 100 %. They need to incorporate simple training for their employees that consist of simple control measures, up to and including doing what the customer asks and not lie to them. Wait until cashiers checks clear before advising clients that it is OK to wire money. This is what I would deem banking XXXX and as the branch manager at XXXX XXXX bank said, this is inexcusable and this would never happen at our bank.and were not near the size of Wells Fargo. 

Please help me in holding Wells Fargo accountable for their multiple mistakes. They should absorb 100 % of the {$73000.00} here and if not, 99 % of it as this all could have been avoidedand simply avoided had they just done what I had asked of them and not lie to me. 

Thank you!"

2887,"I indicated a wire transfer through Wells Fargo for my purchases over in XXXX. The XXXX Bank decided not to fund my vendor the approperit amount resulting in losing my purchased items and not getting my money back. I called Wells Fargo and I asked to cancel the wire transfer, and they told me OK! I keep calling Wells Fargo daily to check on the status of my money. I called once, and they promised me that the fund will be on a Wednesday. I checked my account on Wednesday, and the fund was not there. 

I called again and I started to record the calls, they told me that within 1-2 hours the fund should be in the account. I checked at the end of the day, and the money was not refunded. I do not know why would they lie to me?

I called again 2 times, recorded, and they have informed me that the investigation at Wells Fargo is working on the case. So, at this point, I do not know who to believe. They lie to me thinking that I am just a child. The amount is not low to forget it and move on. Its a large sum of Cash that I am trying to build my trading career and these entities are trying to steal it from me. 


Please consider the request."
2888,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received a text supposedly from Wells Fargo ( WF ) saying they declined a purchase at XXXX for XXXX with my debit card, was this you yes or no? I replied no and started to call WF when I received a call from what I believed was from some type of 1 800 number ( Actually 878 ) saying they were from WF confirming that the purchase of the XXXX was not me. I said yes, that wasn't me and while discussing where this purchase happened I received six more text messages saying a person tried to transfer XXXX  each time using XXXX through WF. I asked for the persons name and he said it was XXXX XXXX and again he was from WF said that someone apparently got one of my or my wife 's debit card numbers and we need to destroy them and that he was in the process of ordering new debit cards for me and my wife, that it would take 7-10 days to deliver. If I didn't receive them after 10 days I needed to call WF back. Then he said that apparently someone had hacked into our on-line account and had made transfers trough XXXX and to only get the money back was to resend for the money to and from myself. I told him that I'd never used XXXX and had no idea how that it worked. He said that I need to use my email address and phone number to make the transfer. He said that they will be i various amounts because that's how XXXX works. After sending over {$40000.00} ( XXXX transactions over the XXXX days of various amounts from XXXX ) I received another text that I'd reached the XXXX for sending money for the month. So I reconfirmed that are debit cards had been sent and the person said yes. on XX/XX/XXXX for some reason it just didn't sound right so I called WF and asked them if they had been assisting me with this XXXX process and they reported that they wouldn't do anything like that. I then said that I had been talking with a representative from WF and they said no that they wouldn't call me or assist making money transfers over the phone. They transferred me to the WF Fraud department and I talked with a Virginia and she took my report and that I needed to give them 10 days to investigate. I then called the fraud department back on XX/XX/XXXX tand talked with XXXX and asked if they had any other information so I could file a police report they gave me a confirmation number of XXXX. XXXX said since I transferred the money and the person impersonating a WF banker that it wasn't considered fraud since they didn't actually get into my account. He said that this was an on-line matter and that he was going It was said that I transferred the money from myself to myself from WF to XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was transferred to online customer service ( Virginia ) where they had to cancel the fir confirmation number and reissued number XXXX and she said she was processing all the claims, that again we need to give them 10 days to investigate my case. I then called XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX bank on XX/XX/XXXX and talked with an representative and she said that they couldn't find any account in mine name, however they were able to find the transfers using my cell number and email address. She then said that the money had been transferred to an account and I asked if there was any way they could put a hold on the account, she put me on hold. When she came back on, she asked if I knew anybody by the name of Presly and I said no, she put me on hold again, When she came back on she said that she couldn't provide me any other information due to privacy concerns, I then aske again if they could put a hold on the account where my funds were fraudulently sent to. She said they couldn't off my word, but WF can see all the same transactions and if during their investigation, they could take actions but it was up to WF since I'm a member of their bank. I gave WF a few days and I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and talked with XXXX and asked her how the investigation was proceeding and when I gave her the confirmation number of XXXX, She went on to say that WF was putting in a claim to XXXX for this issue that we would receive a letter once the claim was filed and a decision was made. We contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and he said that since the account was through WF, they had no obligations for the transfers that come from a bank institution that they only get involved if using the XXXX app. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted on-line customer service and asked XXXX, XXXX number XXXX he said that it had been closed that the open confirmation number was XXXX and I said that XXXX was reported to be closed as well. After getting the confirmation numbers squared away, I how the investigation was going and he said that I should be receiving a letter stating the WF has closed the case as of XX/XX/XXXX and that the payments was processed as requested. I requested to get my money back since WF knew where it went and that I didn't send it intentionally, that under the instruction of someone I thought was from Wells Fargo. I then said that after doing some research at www.consumerfinance.gov and that If reading correctly that this may fall under the regulations for Electronic Fund Transfers. XXXX then transferred me to XXXX in the Customer Advocacy Group to start a new case number as a back office complaint file XXXX and they said this could be another 10 days to investigate. I then tried to contact XXXX @ XXXX PCT on XXXX and left a message for a call back so I could ask some questions and requested a call back and instead received an email on XX/XX/XXXX, saying that the transactions were processed correctly and that there were no violations with the regulations involving Electric transfers. The the letter goes on to take our concerns to XXXX and we have already done that, and XXXX said it was a WF matter. I then tired to call back on XX/XX/XXXX with no call back but received another email on XX/XX/XXXX apologizing for any inconvenience hat we experienced."
2891,I XXXX  a {$470.00} by Well Fargo bank on XX/XX/2022 to a seller name XXXX XXXX but turn out he never ship or send me the order. And I have tried to contact the bank but they cant do anything about it
2892,"On XX/XX/2022 my ID, debit card, phone and 2- credit cards were stolen by force from three individuals. I reported this to the police and bank in less then 24 hrs. The thieves hacked into my Wells Fargo bank account and used XXXX to make a {$1500.00} transfer and a {$2000.00} transfer to themselves totaling {$3500.00}. My bank has declined my claim of illegally activity claiming the transactions were authorized."
2895,"XX/XX/XXXX a friend contacted me via XXXX and offered an opportunity to make a financial gain. Initially {$1000.00} was requested to start the process. I then took {$1000.00} and transferred it to that friend via XXXX friend advised the profits from the {$1000.00} investment were ready to be received, after the fee for service was paid. This was {$3500.00}. I paid the {$3500.00} using XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX friend messaged me stating the entire transaction was a lie, a scam. He claimed his account was hacked. I called Wells Fargo within the minute of discovering it was all a scam and reported to them I was a victim of a scam. XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Wells Fargo assuring me they were conducting a thorough investigation. XX/XX/XXXX I received another letter from Wells Fargo stating it was determined that payment was processed as requested & as a courtesy they ( wf ) would continue to attempt with resolution of issue with receiving institution. XX/XX/XXXX I called WF in hopes of pleading my case and finding out how they were attempting a resolution with receiving bank. I begged for some compassion and help as I was financially drained by the scam. Per XXXX with WF bank claim was closed, denied for no XXXX coverage. XXXX assured me WF reached out to receiving institution and asked them to consider making the situation right. I asked XXXX for the institutions name and she denied to give that information. At this time it was made known WF knew which institution was on receiving end. It became clear in that moment that WF was withholding who exactly was on the other end of the scam. The receiving institution knows the real name of the hacker, scammer, liar, conman. When WF refused to give receiving institutions name they also refused to bring the scammer to Justice. I believe rather than protect their own customer they are protecting and aiding a conman. I sat with the defeat for a few weeks contemplating what my options were, denying belief that the bank I have trusted since age XXXX XXXX  would allow such a scam to happen, denying belief that a conman could be allowed by two major multi billion dollar banking institutions to get away with such dishonesty and deceit. Then on XXXX XXXX I made another call to Wells Fargo. I believed that this could not end this way, there is a strong desire for them to show compassion and step outside of the black and white box they are operating out of and look at the world of right and wrong. I refuse to accept that wrong can be acceptable and allowed because it falls under the umbrella of terms of use. I spoke with XXXX at Wells Fargo and shared my opinion of just that with her. By now I was in tears because it is now 3 months later and it has been a very difficult 3 months, I have had no money to fall back on to aid me in essential everyday items. I shared this with XXXX and she assured me claim was denied because I authorized money to be transferred to another bank. I then politely requested XXXX connect me with a manager or supervisor. She then transferred me to executive office ( they are the decision makers located right under CEO in chain of command she shared ). I thought to myself perhaps this will be the individual to show compassion and help make things right. I shared with him my feelings and thoughts, I shared I had hoped for a full refund as I was 100 % the victim in belief that this was a genuine transaction. Nope, no compassion. XXXX was his name, he was very good at stating he understood however he failed to show ANY compassion at all other than voicing he understood. I shared with him it was my belief that I have not been handled with care, nor do I believe a thorough investigation on my behalf has been made although every contact at WF has assured me verbally it has. I shared with him that I advised each and every individual that I have documentation, proof that I was scammed and not once has anyone from the claims department conducting said investigation asked for the documents to show proof of scam on my behalf. He then attempted to transfer me back to claims Department ( seemed like he did not want to deal with my grievance he was quick to reconnect me back to claims ). I assured him I was made well aware he has authority or claims department and could do more to help in my situation. He then went on to verbally imply that I was not careful enough with my information ( he implied I was negligent ) and next time I should be more careful. I was speechless at this. I was speechless that the bank I believed to have my best interests at heart, failed to live up to their promise of going the extra mile to make it right! ( That was a phrase found on their website same day ) also found on the WF website WF claims to put the interest of customers and communities first in all that they do. The actions of XXXX claims department and XXXX all the way up at the executive office were complete opposite to what the principals or brand pillars of WF claims to be. No reinforcements to the essence of WF brand have been exercised by the people who are sworn to uphold this brand. Talking with XXXX and asking for help proved to just be more upsetting. I shared that I felt I was the victim of theft, larceny and robbery. I voiced to XXXX I would like to speak to someone above him or file a formal complaint. XXXX advised there was not anyone above him, that he was second to last level of support but that he could help me escalate a complaint or he could help me back to claims Department. I accepted his assistance with an escalated complaint. He advised I would be waiting 2 business days. I received an email from WF 2 days later advising me in other words that I was at fault and must accept their decision. That I the victim was alone on this and the scammer clearly was aided by both institutions on a victory. I ask that I be looked at as a human being, that my circumstances be considered thoroughly and that my loyalty to WF since age XXXX also be accounted for. I believe I was mistreated 100 % by WF, treated as another number, a statistic rather than a person. I was honest with WF throughout our interactions, I shared my personal information including that I have a young baby. That baby requires essential items and that money as I referred to as my lifeline for her is necessary. If I had any doubt that the interactions between myself and the scammer were that of a scam I would not have given over all my money to be scammed. I ask that WF make a full refund and live up to their brand pillars, do what is right for the community, build lasting relationships that last a lifetime, show you know your customers and care about them as individuals. Work to make the consumers lives easier. The last question I have for WF is.. How could a world-wide business labeled as one of the seven safest banks allow and be okay with any of their loyal customers to be taken advantage of? How could they aid conmen, liars and scammers by denying to do what is right because the situation circumstances are under their terms of use? How could they ignore Regulation E and the EFT act? I ask to be heard and refunded in full. I believe I was robbed and victimized by not only a scam artist but as well by my bank institution. For they have treated me like the villain and aided the true villain vs understanding and recognizing me. WF has an opportunity to do what is right here and shine in its community, doing what is right is far more complicated and powerful but shows the integrity of a company and its people. As of now, WF lacks integrity. They went from helping my buy my first house to allowing me to be visibly robbed and taken advantage of by a scammer. What is WF moral obligation to its customers?"
2896,Hello my name is XXXX XXXX and I had made some transactions regarding a service I was expecting. Further along the lines I ended up finding it was a fraud/scam and immediately contacted my bank when I learned about it. I made a claim/dispute with my bank regarding the fraudulent transactions made and they said they can not refund my money because I authorized the purchases and agreed. I have been scammed and lost exactly XXXX. If I were to have know the sooner about the fraudulent services I would have never allowed the transaction to be processed. Thank you.
2897,"I was expecting wiring instructions for down payment and closing fees on a home purchase, and received fake wiring instructions pretending from "" XXXX XXXX XXXX, P.A. '' which were sent from from XXXX account as "" XXXX '' Received several emails starting XX/XX/2022."
2899,"I rejected the response fro m Wells Fargo  on  XXXX   XXXX   2017 to c omplaint #  XXXX  and WF closed the case before I could respond to their response. I would like CFPB to forward this rejection to WF for the original complaint To  XXXX   XXXX  at WF, I DO NOT once again accept your explanation and response of  XXXX   XXXX   2017. FINALL Y, you have provided the fee schedule that I have been asking for the last 6 months. It now confirms my long standing issue that in addition to the {$16.00} fee for an incoming international wire ( per the fee schedule but waived for me as a premier customer ) there was another {$30.00} deducted from my  XXXX  transactions each that is NOT in your fee structure and thus UNAUTHORIZED and UNACCOUNTED. You again claim ( like   XXXX     XXXX  and   XXXX   XXXX   from your department ) that I should contact the intermediary bank.  XXXX  IS THE INTERMEDIARY BANK. You three "" Senior Correspondence Specialists '' might learn from your junior colleagues a t WF (  ""  XXXX   XXXX , my Branch Manager at the  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  and a person in the wire department that clearly understand that WF is the Intermediary Bank and owe me an explanation ). On top of that, the three of you do not want to call me to clarify and instead keep sending me long winded responses in irrelevant and inaccurate self -praise of customer service hoping to bury the real issue. You could call  XXXX   XXXX  to understand what I am asking for! But you do not want to do. So I have to believe there is a definite intentional effort not to respond to this issue of transparency by WF. You will not tire me out in pursuing this. I want to make sure this is not systematically happening at WF. With thousands of wire transfers thru WF per day, this charge could amount to millions of unauthorized collections from unsuspecting consumers. I am now going to contact main stream media watch dogs to pursue this further.  XXXX   XXXX"
2901,"My issue started when my job lost my direct deposits information and sent me a check by mail. However, my main issue is with my bank, Wells Fargo. On XX/XX/XXXX, I recieved my paycheck for {$940.00}. I did a mobile deposit not soon after, and wells fargo gave {$400.00} up front and the rest was supposed to be deposited after the holiday on the XXXX. 

On the XXXX, I went negative - {$480.00} due to my company withholding the funds and wells fargo taking back the fronted amount given on the XXXX. In addition to two overdraft fees. Wells Fargo informed me that the rest of my amount should be available on the XX/XX/XXXX. 

Considering I would be waiting for a while to receive my income, I transfered {$390.00} from a separate savings account. This put my new negative balance at $ XXXX. 

Fortunately, I recently recieved a settlement check from my previous job at XXXX for {$1100.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the bank to deposit the check and cover any remaining overdraft fees. I was told the check would be available the following day on the XX/XX/XXXX.

The teller at Wells Fargo informed me that I had a positive balance of {$310.00}. I proceeded to ask if any Wells Fargo staff, customer service line or banker, has managed my account and waived my overdraft fees in order for me to collect my previously deposited {$390.00}. She couldn't see any man-made adjustments, so I assumed that the balance was mine considering my previous deposits of {$390.00} and {$940.00}. 

After withdrawing {$300.00} from the original {$310.00}. I noticed that night I did not have {$12.00} dollars in my account, I became negative $ XXXX. 

Realizing, I had made a mistake I went to the bank, on XX/XX/XXXX, to deposit {$280.00} dollars. While at the bank, my check for {$1100.00} was not available. She proceeded to inform me that the check was on hold for collection issues and will be available on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I currently have {$2100.00} on hold for due to collection issues although the checks are from different banks and companies. 

I could really use help considering my next paycheck will be arriving XX/XX/XXXX. Thank you for any assistance."
2903,"Commencing on or about XX/XX/2022, I fell victim to a multilayered scam operation orchestrated by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the Company ), with the design, development, manufacture, promoting, marketing, distribution, labeling, and/or sale of illegal and outright fraudulent investment services, '' all of which aim at contributing to the goal of robbing and defrauding clients, through a predetermined cycle of client losses to gains. 
Money was transferred from my account via bank wire and through an intermediary named "" XXXX "" in the total amount of XXXX USD."
2905,"XX/XX/XXXX, I deposited a money order into Wells Fargo. I noticed I confirmed for {$100.00} instead of {$1000.00}. So I submitted a claim for the remaining balance. 

So about 2 days later, I saw a deposit reflected in my account but not liquid. So I called to inquire. After not understanding why the money order was still being held outside of the minor issue with me depositing it, I asked to speak with a manager. 

XXXX said Wells Fargo needed to ensure they would be able to collect on the funds. I was confused since CASH was ALREADY PAID FOR THE MONEY ORDER so officially, they've collected on the funds. 

He told me they would probably release the funds on the XXXX of XXXX. It's baffling to hear him give a date as to when the funds would be released. So it's not that you're investigating anything, you're just holding them just because. And if there was a reason, I am entitled to justification because it's my money. 

And because he could not offer that info to me, I told him goodday and I can tell he was upset. So IN ADDITION to me not being able to touch my OWN CASH and it being unreasonably held excessively, without them being able to prove a lengthier hold is reasonable, XXXX FREEZES my account. 

I went to SEVERAL WELLS FARGO ATMs that night and could not get any money. My last try was an XXXX & XXXX XXXX  and i was told their were insufficient funds while looking at the funds. 

So on my good Wednesday night, I am outside of a CLUB, ON THE PHONE WITH WELLS FARGO bc I also CAN NOT XXXX  my sister thr money I just had to borrow from her. 

At first, the rep didn't see the problem but after he dug deeper, he saw ut and said my account shouldn't have been frozen. I mentioned the overzealous manager I spoke with earlier, who answered EVERY different question with the ONE ANSWER. And that's "" we can hold anything paper and we are holding your money order until we can collect on the funds, '' NO MATTER WHAT I ASKED. 

He apologized and said one has NOTHING to do with the other and he removed the freeze. This is DISGUSTING to say the least. AND he isn't at fault so his apology won't suffice. NOBODY shoukd have that much emotional REACH over someone elses money. I want my money and I want proper justification as to WHY it was held this long. This isn't even the THIRD TIME I've deposited the money order and if I haven't called about my hiccup, i don't feel they would've held it. This has to be illegal, ESPECIALLY what XXXX did. He does NOT have the legal authority to make the sole decision to freeze or hold my account, especially over a tantrum. I want him reprimanded. I spoke to him on XX/XX/XXXX, around XXXX. The calls are supposed to be recorded so it shouldn't be hard to verify."

2913,"The shock came during the week of XXXX XXXX. We were devastated to learn that my husband was victim of a telephone scam, the banks securities had failed, and the savings can not be recuperated. He had been called supposing from the SSA and they had told him there were charges on him and that the social security number had been used for drug trafficking and money laundering. He was so scared of having to go to prison and not being able to see our daughter and me that he believed the story. Additionally, he was told not to tell anyone about this because else it would go public. He was tracked for a week and when they found out he was about to transfer all our savings from XXXX to here ( {$260000.00} ). The scammers told him that he needed to send the money to a safe account in XXXX. He would then get the money with his new Social Security number which would not have any charges on it because they now were sure that he was not involved in any drug trafficking. We already had the contract for a house and the money from XXXX was supposed to be the down payment. Of course, no money came, and my husband broke down and we had to cancel the house contract. We reported this to the police and the FBI, but nothing is happening. Also, the involded banks ( Wellsfargo and  XXXX XXXX ) are not very cooperative. {$30000.00} USD had been transferred from our Wells Fargo account to the fraud account in XXXX. We had just opened the account, transferred some money into the account and the bank knew that we were planning to buy a house. How could they have not asked for a reason for us to transfer all our money to a known money scamming country? Why are there no extra security checks in place for these types of suspicious transactions? My husband was blackmailed, and it should have rung all the bells within the bank. 
We have asked the bank to try to stop the transaction and get the money back but they said that they had tried but not succeeded and that it was our own fault. 
Wells Fargo allowef the transaction on XX/XX/2020 XXXX . The XXXX XXXX XXXX allowed following transactions. Transaction Amount : {$140000.00} Transaction Date : XX/XX/2020 and Transaction Amount : {$90000.00} Transaction Date : XX/XX/2020."

I completed an over the phone interview and was told that it was a work from home job that the company would cover the cost of equipment. It turns out it was a scam and I'm now out {$4800.00} and the bank won't help me with financial problems and has even told me they have frozen my accounts and are closing all of my accounts, regardless of whether I wanted to or not. While trying to seek legal actions against the other people involved, due to the fact that I have all of their information, law enforcement has told me "" to chock it up as a loss '' and told me it's a learning experience. My life has come to a screeching halt and I have no where to turn."
2916,"On XX/XX/XXXX around midnight, i had a family member vacationing and her XXXX messaging app got hacked and I was a victim of a scam. 
The hackers reached out through her personal phone pretending to be her stating she was in a emergency and needed me to send her money through XXXX through some email accounts she provided. I sent the money and minutes later I get contacted by another family member of ours letting me know that my cousins phone had been compromised. 

I have contacted my financial institution ( Wells Fargo ) and opened a claim right away. It was not until days later that I reach out requesting an update on the claim when I realized the cases had been closed and nothing could be done"
2917,"Prior to sending this transfer request I checked and rechecked with Wells Fargo to confirm that I was in fact mailing them all of the required documentation needed to process my request as there are specific forms and documents that are required - they confirmed that I was in fact sending them exactly what they needed in order to process my request which included notarized written instructions from me showing my signature. 

A transfer request was sent by me via next day mail to Wells Fargo with delivery confirmed on XXXX. 

The request was to transfer XXXX from one account and XXXX from another account into one account at a XXXX XXXX  - both accounts at Wells Fargo are in the name of my Mother who passed away on XXXX ; I am the personal representative. The background is I had full access to these accounts to help my Mother manage her finances and I am also a long time Wells Fargo customer having several active accounts with them at this time. 

After about 5 days I called Wells Fargo and they confirmed receipt of the required documentation and also confirmed that the documents had been scanned into their system and ready for processing. They confirmed that it would take about 20 days to process. 

After about 20 days I called and they said it would take a little longer perhaps 30 days from date of receipt to process. 

I waited and called again after about 30 days and they said it would be processed within one week of my phone call. 

I called back after about one week and they said they needed me to fill out form W-9 and mail it back to them and that they would then be able to complete my request ( I was not previuosly informed by Wells Fargo that this form was actually a requirement even after checking and rechecking with them ). 

I confirmed that the requested W-9 form was delivered to Wells Fargo on XXXX at which time I ask them when my requested transactions would take place and the Rep stated it would take another 24 days. Based on the response so far I have no confidence that my requested transactions will be processed after another 24 days of waiting. 

Furthermore, on a personal note this is particularly XXXX  to hold me XXXX by not performing the requested very simple, everyday transactions ; especially after the passing of my Mother and the fact that I have funeral expenses to pay from these particular funds. To add insult to injury, I am the one that recommended to my Mother that she put her life savings into Wells Fargo accounts."
2920,"We searched online for a horse trailer and found one that was located in NY. After agreeing on price and terms, we were sent wire transfer instructions. The money ( {$4300.00} ) was sent and receipt was confirmed. The trailer was supposed to ship in 25 days. 

When we had not heard anything from the company, we attempted to contact them with no luck. We ultimately determined it was a scam. The wiring instructions are attached. 

We requested Wells Fargo rescind the wire but have heard nothing from them. We also attempted to call XXXX XXXX  who was the recipient bank but they did not respond."
2921,"As we all know what is going on in XXXX and how XXXX people are suffering due to XXXX aggression against XXXX. Governments and people around the world are trying to help XXXX people in need who were forced to flee their houses and their cities, leaving everything behind. Same happened with my friend and his family of XXXX kids, who had to flee XXXX and move his family to XXXX part of XXXX for safety. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a wire transfer from my Wells Fargo personal savings account to his account with XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  located in XXXX XXXX, just to ease their suffering. Wells Fargo happily charged my account {$45.00} for wire transfer fee. Original funds delivery date was on XX/XX/XXXX. Until this date XX/XX/XXXX funds weren't delivered to beneficiary or returned to my account. After numerous calls to Wells Fargo Bank and spending multiple hours on the phone, being transferred from one department to another still no resolution. Received multiple case numbers.. Case Number : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. Spoke with numerous Wells Fargo 's reps : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX. Responses varied from : money will be delivered tomorrow, in couple days and final excuse... wire was stopped due to XXXXrelated Sanctions! XXXX! 
There are no sanctions against XXXX!!!! Sanctions against XXXX due to XXXX aggression against XXXX!! 

This can be checked easily be visiting treasury.gov website. This link is for Wells Fargo so called "" investigators '' XXXX XXXX XXXX Wire wasn't sent to XXXX or XXXX  person!! 
I'm utterly disappointed with Wells Fargo Bank and their apathy to people 's suffering."
2922,"I've been a loyal customer to Wells Fargo for 10 years with no issues or complaints until recently. I fell victim to fraud with a very elaborate scam made through XXXX, an app thats automatically added into our accounts as a method of instant money transactions. On XX/XX/2021, I received a text message from my bank, Wells Fargo, asking to confirm or deny an attempted transaction for the amount of {$1500.00}. I replied, NO. Minutes after, I received a call from a Wells Fargo official line ( XXXX ). This person claimed to be a Wells Fargo representative, along with having all my personal banking information such as my card number, account number, and exact amount and place of my last made transactions. ( Information only my bank is supposed to have and behold safely away from any possible fraudulent exposure ). This person then explained to me that someone had stolen my bank information and was pretending to be me to send money out of my account through XXXX. He informed me, the only way to reverse these transactions was if I transferred the money back to myself from the mobile app. This sounded odd to me because my bank has never called to ask for something like this before. He then explained how XXXX was a separate service, and they had no access to control or stop these transactions themselves. Using fear and pressure, I was persuaded on making four different transactions ( two for {$1000.00} and two for {$500.00} ) with the grand total of {$3000.00}. I was told that these transactions would result in reversing the withdrawal that was trying to be taken without my permission. 

After the last transaction was made, the call was simply disconnected. My heart dropped and I instantly called the bank right back. This time a real Wells Fargo representative answered. I explained the situation ; I was placed on hold and then told the bank had no record of my call ; it wasnt them that called me. They then explained the transactions were still pending and being transferred to a XXXX account that had been made under my email and name. Assuring me they had contacted XXXX and XXXX about the fraudulent transactions, they said to wait from 3 to 5 business days for an answer.

I understand the responsibility of me allowing these transactions. My concern is that Wells Fargo is failing to see they are the ones that got hacked and I'm the one paying the consequences for it. Their lines got hacked and their customer information got leaked, and therefore me trusting my bank and their use and protection of my account and personal information, I got tricked into thinking I was speaking to my own bank. 

Either my money was stolen via Wells Fargo employee, or the system was completely hacked and I'm suffering the consequences of it. Neither of those two options happen to leave me responsible for the disappearance of my money. 

I've contacted the chain of commands within Wells Fargo since the minute this incident happened and all efforts from Wells Fargo employees have been completely subversive. I honestly dont believe they did or even tried to do anything to stop this, in fact they allowed it. 

Wells Fargo refuses to take responsibility for these actions by explaining XXXX is a separate service, and they have no control over it, when in fact XXXX is owned by seven of Americas largest banks ( Wells Fargo being one of them ). So how did this still happen? Why would XXXX allow an account to be open with just a name and email? Why did XXXX approve these fraudulent transactions after being contacted and alerted of fraudulent activity? None of this makes sense ; nor is it fair for people like me, that have been made a victim of this bank, to just allow and accept as my own mistake. 

I strongly believe this violates the code of banking conduct and ethics. I've taken this to multiple escalated complaints and even to the board of directors and XXXX XXXXCEO XXXX XXXX XXXX. Contacting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is one of my last and most hopeful reach and scream for help. I am in the dark, with no guidance or knowledge on how to deal with this very unexpected distress.

This situation has taken more than just my winter savings, it's taken my peace and joy of life. With XXXX and XXXX I haven't properly slept since this nightmare started. I was forced to sell my vehicle to sustain myself from this gigantic loss, which left me mentally drained and very physically tired. All I'm asking is for consideration and responsibility on getting back what's mine and LOST IN MINUTES, by my bank ( Wells Fargo ) that allowed this to happen by a service they own ( XXXX ) to a bank they have total and full communication with ( XXXX ). 

I have been building a timeline with exact days, time frames and names of people I've spoken to, along with all my evidence and proof this was an obvious scam from within the bank. If no one has the power to stop this, it will continue to happen because no obvious consequences are being pushed on Wells Fargo. All other banks are taking responsibility over these situations by returning the money to their customers EXCEPT Wells Fargo. I really need your help. 

Sincerely, A very concerned victim of this banking system."
2923,"Wells Fargo VERIFIED a SCAM CHECK of XXXX on XX/XX/2022 when I clearly MULTIPLE TIMES asked them to check properly before deposit the check. They deposited and make the cash available. When bank returned back the check, I realized I was scammed and immediately reported to the bank. Unfortunately, I have already XXXX and Wire Transfer the money to the scammer thinking that was the money from the check who Wells Fargo VERIFIED. 

Now Wells Fargo don't want to take responsibility on their own mistake. After I realized I've been scammed, I asked multiple bankers to check the check without telling them that is a scam check. And THEY KNOW it is a scam check. Why in the beginning they verified and cashed it?????"
2924,On XX/XX/XXXX I received and email asking for the amount of {$150000.00} to finalize the down payment of my house. That same day into Wells Fargo wanting to make a wire transfer to XXXX XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX my real estate agent XXXX XXXX called me to tell me that that escrow has not received my payment. That same day I let Wells Fargo told me that there had been fraud on my account. They told me the money would be returned in 10-12 day. After that they told me that there would be an investigation the manager XXXX XXXX told me she would be in charge of the investigation but never heard anything back from XXXX where the bank was sent.
2925,"On XX/XX/XXXX while waiting for my sons XXXX  XXXX, I recieved a call from a number showing Wells Fargo Security and answered and advised that a XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX had processed XXXX through XXXX and asked if I had given permission. I advised no. He then identified himself as XXXX XXXX a 24hr fraud monitoring officer who would help me stop the process and put the money back into my account. He then sent a verification code and then walked me through how to block her transactions and put the money back into my account. He then gave me a case number and his badge number advising he would speak with me in 24 hrs. When it was getting close to 24hrs, I walked into my local branch of wells fargo and advised them, the manager told me that they were busy and to call online fraud that it had been less then 24 hrs and they would try to stop the transactions. I called and filed complaint for each transaction as there were 3. I recieved claims. On XX/XX/XXXX I recieved letters dated XX/XX/XXXX from wells fargo advising that the money had been sent as asked and the claims were considered closed. I called XX/XX/XXXX speaking to XXXX who advised me the letters were correct and it was not fraud but a scam. I then requested to speak to or escalate my claim. I was told I would be contacted in 24 hrs as claims do not get delayed. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX as I had heard nothing and spoke to XXXX who transferred me to XXXX who advised me that there is 2 days to acknowledge the claim and they have 10 days to respond. On XX/XX/XXXX spoke with XXXX who advised that ultimately no claim had been filed and closed out the Executive Claim and to call customer care service. XX/XX/XXXX I called back Executive Claim and spoke w/XXXX "" XXXX XXXX who helped and placed me on hold but ultimately was dropped. I called back and spoke w/XXXX who then transferred me to customer care and I spoke w/XXXX who then transferred me to higher supervisor XXXX who ultimately told me that the case is closed and there is no recourse and she would not take another claim, she then transferred me to customer advocacy but was disconnected on after over an hour on hold. There is a pending meeting w/local branch manager on XX/XX/XXXX."
2927,"Wells Fargo keeps claiming that I, or someone who was authorized, was the one who made a XXXX charge on my account. Neither is true and I did not authorize this XXXX transaction. The transaction was made fraudulently and they are not taking any action to protect me. Below is the original message I sent through CFPB - Complaint ID XXXX -- On XX/XX/XXXX I had a total of {$2000.00} frauded from my account via XXXX. I did not approve this transaction or make this transaction. I contacted Wells Fargo soon after about this fraud case, and they recently reported on XX/XX/XXXX that they have not approved of my claim. The case number is XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX TO XXXX XXXX XXXX ON XX/XX/XXXX REF # XXXX {$1000.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX TO XXXX XXXX XXXX ON XX/XX/XXXX REF # XXXX {$950.00}"
2928,"On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo ( WF ) removed {$2500.00} from my checking account statement dated XX/XX/XXXX. This was done after a very long fraud suite . Which I had sent CFPB a complaint and received a letter from the WF Executive Office Case Specialist, XXXX XXXX, who said in his letter XX/XX/XXXX, that if I have a questions to call him. But after many messages and no reply. I am needing CFPB 's help. My XX/XX/XXXX statement, on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX removed {$2500.00}. This was not their money! The description says : Online Advance Reversal Case XXXX. The only advance made was to account XXXX the fraud money on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX which was withdrawn on XX/XX/XXXX for the fraud wire transfer. I didn't receive any other advance to help pay my bills. I question a transaction on a statement dated XX/XX/XXXX Personal Line of Credit acct. XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX ( after all accounts where closed and stopped for transactions ) a {$2500.00} withdrawal was made with the description "" Balance transfer for acct ending in XXXX '. I have not had a XXXX account! So this must be the third parties account number who received an advance. It sure wasn't me! WF owes me the {$2500.00} they withdrew on XX/XX/XXXX from my acct XXXX!!!"
2929,"Wells Fargo Case Fraud number : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Fraud Case number : Claim # XXXX and Claim # XXXX I was involved ( the buyer ) in a real estate transaction where Wells Fargo called my title company and said they wouldn't release the funds to the seller because they were running a deed fraud scam and the name on the account did not match the account number. Today has marked XXXX weeks. This was not able to be recorded obviously because it was flagged as fraud. 

A wire recall was supposedly requested by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX as requested by Wells Fargo over 6 weeks ago. 

I cant get any information at all. The title insurance wont pay out because its fraud and Wells Fargo said theyd return the funds. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX won't answer any questions regarding this case either. Both are pointing the finger and saying the other bank isn't responding. 

If Wells Fargo is looking to make sure the case was fraud before returning the funds my title company sent hold harmless over two weeks ago, but also if you need proof that it is fraudulent ( and it's the first thing I noticed that the title company should have caught ) is that the notary stamp on page 6 ( below ) you can look up commission ID 's on Pennsylvania 's department of State website and can see that the name does not match the commission number. If you call the notary with this commission number ( her number is in the department of state directory ) she confirms she did not notarize this transaction. The Driver 's license provided as ID to the closer the DL number does not exist according to the records. 

I can't get any answers from anyone on this they keep telling me to speak to my bank, but my bank has said Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX aren't responding.

2934,"I sent a wire transfer from my Wells Fargo account in the amount of {$4000.00}. The wire transfer showed as completed on XX/XX/XXXX, but the beneficiary did not receive it. I called the bank on XX/XX/XXXX and submitted a claim saying the wire was never received ( and asked for it to be returned to my account because I paid the beneficiary via other means ). I kept calling to get a status update and no one could tell me anything. I received a response on XX/XX/XXXX that the claim was denied because Wells Fargo did not get a response from the beneficiary bank. I called and was told that the Wells Fargo agent submitted the claim incorrectly and a new claim had to be submitted. They kept telling me it would be resolved in XXXX business days maximum. I keep calling for a status update and again no one could tell me anything. 

I kept being told that it could take some time and depends on the response from the beneficiary bank. I kept saying that the beneficiary bank never received the wire ( which I confirmed with the beneficiary bank several times ). Finally, XXXX of the XXXX I called on XX/XX/XXXX a Wells Fargo representative said he called a different wire department and found out the funds were being held by the Compliance department because of an OFAC hit and they needed information to clear it ( no one had reached out to me for information ). I gave the information and called to follow up later that day. The agent told me the compliance department had now cleared the wire. I told him I dont want it to go out because I already paid the money another way, I want the funds returned. He said that is not his department. I called the claims department and customer service to tell them about this and no one could do anything. They just said the claim is being investigated and they will probably update me when they hear from the beneficiary bank. I kept saying the bank never received it. The funds have been held by Wells Fargo compliance this whole time! 

There is apparently no way for anyone ( including agents in the claims department ) to contact the investigators by phone. I have requested repeatedly that they have the investigator call me and he has not. I believe I was told I would be called when there is an update. It seems they are just waiting to hear back from the beneficiary bank, but that bank never received the funds. I am at a loss of what to do."
2935,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I was at work when I received a text message from XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX with a message stating, "" Thank you for confirming this recent activity ; a representative will be in contact with you. I disregarded the message because I did not confirm anything. I then got a phone call from XXXX. I did not answer the phone call because I was at work. I was called a second time by that same number, and I decided to look on the back of my Wells Fargo card and saw that it was their customer service number, so I picked up the phone. Since it was their customer service, I thought nothing of it, and the Wells Fargo "" representative '' who I thought it was told me that someone from Texas has access to your online account and that they are attempting to send themselves money and that I must act quickly because they got into my online account with my username and password. Frantic, I asked what I should do, and the "" representative '' told me that he would create a new account for me and transfer my funds. He said that wiring the funds would be the quickest way to move the funds to the new account. He then went through the protocol by asking me for my name, account number, and phone number so that he could text over a verification code to verify my identity. Again, I thought nothing of it because this is what typically the Wells Fargo representatives would do and have done in the past. 

The transfer of {$15000.00} was initiated, and the account was the account I thought he had created for me, but it turned out not to be. There was a confirmation number, and I saw that my old account had reached zero dollars, so in my mind, the funds were being taken out and transferred to the new account he told me he was creating for me. He then concluded by saying that my supervisor would give you a call tomorrow, XX/XX/XXXX, to finalize and that you would receive a letter in the mail stating that you now have a new account. 

The next day, XX/XX/XXXX, I've waited and no phone call, so I called the customer service number located on the back of my card and did the exact same protocol as the person who I spoke to on the XXXX. I told the representative the situation, and she said that we did not call you, ma'am, and then transferred me to the fraud department. From there, the fraud department did the same protocol and once again told me that we did not call you ma'am and that I was being scammed. The representative then went ahead and closed my account and created a new account for me, along with sending me a new credit card. 

I asked her about an account that was made for me on the XXXX, and she stated, there is no account made for you. At this point, I was hysterical because I am a student, and I am paying for my tuition and paying for rent, and other bills. So I filed a claim, and she gave me the claim number on that same day, XX/XX/XXXX. 

She then told me to wait 2-10 days, or it could even be longer, and I will receive a phone call. Days went by, and I decided to call the fraud department at XXXX and ask for an update. This was on XX/XX/XXXX, and when I called, the representative did the same protocol to verify my identity, and she told me that this was a wiring transfer, so she then transferred me to the wiring department. I reached someone from the wiring department, and I once again explained the entire situation that and this representative told me that since this is an online wiring transaction, I would need a claim number. I asked her about the claim number that I received from the fraud department, but she stated they are a different department, so that claim number would be invalid in this case of a wiring transfer. She gave me a new claim number, and told me to continue waiting and that a claim specialist will contact me. I also asked her to note to please call me after 5 because I work, and all three times that I received a phone call, I'm assuming from the claim specialist were all in the morning, and because of that, I was unable to answer. Someone called me on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX AM, I called back, and they told me that they are still working on it, and again, I asked them to please note to call me after 5. The second time I received a call was on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX AM, unable to pick up. I called back, and they said that the claim specialist is still working on it, but the representative told me that it might be best to file a police report. Again, I told the representative to please note to call me after 5. I got the last call on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX AM, but I could not pick up, I called back, and the representative told me that the claim was closed and denied since they could not pause the transaction or receive back any funds. 

I am very disheartened and felt that the entire time I spoke to all of the representatives, I felt as if they were taking this situation very lightly and that the attitude was, well, it happened to you and not me and gave me tips to avoid fraudulent activity. I also went into the bank 's branch on XX/XX/XXXX and was with the banker for 2 hours and they could not help me. 

I filed a police report on XX/XX/XXXX and I was told by the officer to wait for a week to go and pick up my police report at XXXX Headquarters, as a result, I do not currently have the report."
2938,"I received payments through XXXX money transfer, as it was an easier option and a service I trusted. I received the money over the course of XXXX days, XX/XX/2022 to XX/XX/2022.

I was surprised to see that the amounts were reversed and it was taken from my account. I was not notified and was not made aware that such claim was filed against me. I just saw the money was taken from my account and was given no further information about the case"
2939,I was given a unpaid check of {$3500.00} and I did not know it was unpaid and It was on hold for a few days before it could clear and it was cleared into my account then I gave the money back and after a few days later the check bounced from my account after the transactions went through and i am now down {$3500.00} in debt because of this

Then on XX/XX/22 I sent another wire transfer because I was told my funds in my accounts were at risk for being stolen so I had to make a security hold wire transfer of XXXX. When I finally realized I was a victim of Fraud I went to the bank and told them what happened and showed proof of documents I received from who I thought was the FBI they opened 2 cases but then I was notified that one case was closed and cant get my money back.

XXXX XXXX, the banker at the branch, assisted me in initiating an international wire transfer for the amount of {$11000.00}. I showed her XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Supposed Recipient ) bank information on my phone and she inputted it whilst reading it from my phone. On the first attempt at the transfer request XXXX XXXX failed to input the XXXX information correctly and we had to re-do the request. On the second attempt the XXXX was correct however, XXXX XXXX had misspelled both the name and address details of the supposed recipient. On the third attempt the XXXX was correct however the name and address had again been misspelled.

They advised it was Wells Fargo that had to recall the funds and were not able to disclose any information on who the actual recipient of the funds was. 


XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - On returning to the XXXX after the XXXX break I return to the same Wells Fargo branch to recall the failed wired transfer. A different banker was present to the one who initially assisted me in the transfer. He advised me that they did not have the capabilities at the branch to recall a wired international transfer. He gave me a number to ring for Wells Fargo Wire Transfer Services. I rang this number and explained the situation as per above. They initiated the recall of the wire transfer and gave me the case number : XXXX. The woman informed me that it could be up to two weeks before I would hear back from them. 

XXXX XX/XX/XXXX- The woman working with Wells Fargo Wire Transfer Services rang me explaining how Wells Fargo attempted to recall the funds but XXXX  of XXXX had advised there were no funds on their end available for recall. I emailed XXXX XXXX to see if they could assist any further with the investigation.

This money never returned to me and when I spoke to the representatives at the real Wells Fargo, they said they would investigate this and would be able to return my fund because I was wrongfully scammed. I just received a letter now that they have closed this claim and will not be returning any money. Its truly unfair that this situation has occurred and that I was mislead by those at Wells Fargo because they were unable to help out due to the fact that I was manipulated into authorizing this transaction.

Caller said someone had gotten into our checking account and was transferring money via XXXX. They said that we were to access account from our computer and follow certain instructions they were giving. including changing our password. Once that was done, "" XXXX '' money transfers began. Three immediate transfers of {$700.00}, {$1000.00} and {$1800.00}. When the transfers started, we called WFB from a different phone and explained what was happening. The transfers stopped and our account was closed. 

We then spent at least two ( 2 ) hours on the phone with WFB talking with different individuals ( fraud department? ). We were ultimately instructed to file a claim with the WFB Fraud division, which we did. We had many ( at least 20 ) following discussions with WFB on the phone and in our local Branch. Ultimately WFB denied our claim and refused to tell us where and/or to whom the money was transferred. Instead, WFB told us that in order to find out where and to whom the money was transferred, we would have to file a claim with the local Police and/or the FBI. We tried calling XXXX for more information, but they would not discuss the matter and instead directed us to have any and all conversations with WFB, We ultimately were directed to the "" Executive Division '' of the WFB Fraud Department ; and after about a month of discussions, we got nowhere except receipt of another letter of rejection.

We understand that WFB owns XXXX ; and, we further presume that a WFB employee may have been making this fraudulent transfer. We have been regularly banking with WFB for more than 60 years, and would like to get back our stolen {$3500.00}."

At the time, complaints were filed with the Florida Attorney General 's office, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation, the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. As per information released by subpoena and included in the police report, Wells Fargo allowed the account to be closed on XX/XX/2018 with the withdrawal amount of {$11000.00}.

2970,"This unfortunate event happened on XX/XX/2018. I was going to buy two tickets for a hockey game from a post from XXXX for {$120.00}. The seller was originally selling four ticket for {$100.00} each, but I only needed two and we agreed on {$120.00} for two tickets. The guy said he was going to transfer me the tickets to my flash-seat account, so I gave him my email address so he could transfer the tickets. I sent the money through XXXX to a XXXX XXXX XXXX account from my Wellsfargo account. In order for me to transfer the money I needed his name and phone number. So the money was sent and no tickets were received. It was a total scam, I tried calling him multiple times and it turns out that he blocked me and the number he gave me was a temporary number, like the ones that you can get online. I called my bank multiple times and was told that the money had already been paid and that they could not do anything. I called my bank the next day again and I was able to open a claim and per Wellsfargo they could not refund me the money and that the money was paid out to a person with a different name and not the name that I was given by the scammer. I don't know how that happened that the money was received by a different account holder name. I did not think that the money could be deposited to an account with a different name. I thought the name had to match and the phone number, but I guess that was not the case. If what I was told by Wellsfargo was correct that the name is not the one that the scammer gave me, I think that person should return me my money. I think that's illegal for someone to keep a money that doesn't belong to them. I also submitted a complaint to XXXX and off course they never responded. I called XXXX and they could not help me, they told me that my bank ( Wellsfargo ) needed to help me. I submitted a police report and they could not help me. So I am not getting help form anyone. I think that either XXXX XXXX  XXXX or Wellsfargo need to give me my money back. I am not happy with Wellsfargo because if they are offering me a service they need to make sure that their consumers are protected either by you ( Wellfargo ) or by XXXX. Wellsfago needs to make sure that there are consumer protection regulations in place and fraud protection with the service that they are offering ( XXXX ). After this incident happened, I did my research and it appears that a lot of the fraud is happening between Wellsfargo and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, also 90 % of the transactions that are done through XXXX are fraud related. Something needs to be done immediately. I felt confident that since my bank was offering a service that they have done all their due diligence to protect the consumer. This can not happen anymore, this needs to stop. I thought I could trust Wellsfargo, but I don't think I can anymore. Yes, I learned my lesson not to send money to anyone through XXXX if I don't know the person. But I would like a full refund on my transaction."
2973,"I opened up a case with the the Consumer Financial Protections Bureau case # ( XXXX ) Wells Fargo issued a provisional credit to my account on XX/XX/2022 and on XX/XX/2022 Wells Fargo withdrew this provisional credit without providing any warning and or proof of evidence regarding the case in question. I have received no notification that this was to take place or evidence showing why my claim was denied. 

I have requested proof that Wells Fargo was not directly responsible for defrauding me of my money in the 1st place. I was defrauded when Wells Fargo reached out to me asking me if I verified a charge. I answered no to this question, an got a phone call shortly their after and was asked the normal vetting questions and then asked by the Wells Fargo representative to secure my account from an active threat.

The scammer then replied from the real email address of XXXX with wire instructions for an account that we now know is actually not affiliated with XXXX XXXX. I sent the wire on XX/XX/XXXX and today, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX reached out to tell me that they had not yet received my check. That led to us discovering that his email account had been "" hacked ''. 

My bank, XXXX XXXX Bank XXXX Arkansas ), wired the money to Wells Fargo Bank."
2985,"{$180.00} dollars was stolen from my account when I agreed to pay said amount for concert tickets to a man online. When I payed this money, the man subsequently blocked my number, closed his XXXX account and I am now unable to reach him. I called my bank and tried to file a claim, but Wells Fargo denies to cover this, despite being a massive bank and being insured. The app is vulnerable to be used by fraudsters, and should be closed down, or accounts should be more closely tied to customer 's identities. The fact that XXXX openly acknowledges the absurd amount of fraud that happens on their application, but refuses to do anything just shows how they are violating the trust of the consumer."
2987,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I deposited a XXXX XXXX XXXX  cashiers check for XXXX into my personal checking account at Wells Fargo. This check was coming from a company ( XXXX ) that had given me an job offer letter to be a remote employee for them starting XX/XX/XXXX. The check was for teleconferencing equipment to set-up my home office. As they explained, I needed to use that XXXX to pay several merchants and the IT person at XXXX in charge of setting up the equipment. 

When I cashed the cashiers check, I was informed by the teller at Wells Fargo that funds would be available the next day. On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I accessed my Wells Fargo account online, and my account showed that the funds had indeed been deposited on my account and the money was available. When I saw that the money had entered my account, I assumed that Wells Fargo had properly verified and cleared this cashiers check before making the funds available on my account. For this reason, I went ahead and initiated transactions to paid the merchants and the IT person as instructed by my new employer. The transactions totaled XXXX. Even though it seemed a little strange to me that the process to pay for the equipment was so convoluted, I did not think at the time this was a scam because they had given me the money, and that deposit had been cleared by Wells Fargo and deposited on my account. In addition, the final transaction, a wire, was made at a Wells Fargo branch. I told the banker that initiated the wire the objective of the transaction and the origin of those funds. Why did this person not warn me about this transaction if he should know that the cashiers check could be fraudulent and still needed to clear? On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, ( Two days after I started those transfers ) I got a message from Wells Fargo stating that the cashiers check had "" bounced '' and that my account now had a negative balance because the XXXX deposit from XX/XX/XXXX had been reversed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, as soon as I saw Wells Fargos message about the cashiers check bouncing, I immediately started a fraud complain with Wells Fargo, but they are telling me that if the funds can't be recovered it will be my loss, not their loss. I do not understand why Wells Fargo is making me responsible for a fraudulent cashiers check if they were the ones that failed to perform proper due diligence on those funds before depositing the money on my account. If Wells Fargo takes 4 days to clear a cashiers check, then they should only deposit that money on my account after 4 days, when they have verified those funds. As a consumer, I should not be responsible for knowing that a cashiers check can "" bounce '' after the money has been deposited on my account after several days. Isn't a cashiers check supposed to be "" guaranteed funds ''? and if wells Fargo took that cashiers check and made the money available on my account, why would I doubt the validity of that check. Also, Wells Fargo failed to inform me that it could take up to 4 days for the cashier check to clear. If I had known that and I saw that the money was "" pending '', then I would not had initiated those transactions for those vendors until cleared. I need Wells Fargo to make me whole in this XXXX deposit since they are the ones that failed to perform proper due diligence on the proceeds of those funds and failed to provide proper warnings on their process to clear those funds."
2991,On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a amount of {$200.00} to a man named XXXX XXXX. This was done through XXXX. I immediately notified my bank about the scammer and they started working on this. I was notified by them today XX/XX/XXXX that they cant do anymore to get the money back and requested I contact and report it here. I have all the messages between me and the other person. The bank has his true name and bank account informs as well. There is a paper trail through XXXX to track the money also.
2993,"Yesterday XX/XX/2019 I was trying to purchase tickets to a concert through XXXX. I had a few back and forth emails with a person who seemed legitimate and was going to sell me his tickets. We agreed on a price and I sent him via XXXX on the wells Fargo app the amount of {$400.00}. I did not receive the tickets. After realizing I've been scammed I decided to call wells Fargo today XX/XX/2019. I spoke to a representative, they told me I could file a claim but not with them, with XXXX, so they transferred me. I spoke to a XXXX representative who told me there was nothing they could do. They suggested I file a police report, which I am going to do tomorrow morning. I also filed a complaint under the internet crimes department. I just feel a bit helpless and banking with Wells Fargo for many years, they are usually more helpful than that. I'm understandably upset."
2994,"I am a victim of a scammer ; I had a job offer on XXXX as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and that job had a one-week trial that they were going to send me a check and I was going to do some shopping, donation and etc... I have received the check by mail from the company and since I was not very familiar with whether it was a valid check I took it to the bank ( Wells Fargo ) and deposited it in my account and asked the banker when it will be available and their answer was "" By tomorrow morning ''. So, I was assured that the check was valid. So, I did all the transactions that they were asked for me to have done on XX/XX/2021 in the amount of {$4900.00}. The next day I deposited another check, not from ATM but I walked inside the bank and deposited it in the account again I asked the same question, and the teller responded the same answer. However, the next day morning I checked my account and notice the bank did put both of the checks on hold. I called and asked what is happening and they told me that they are suspicious that those checks are Fraud. So, I did some research online and noticed that it was a new method that scammers scam people. Therefore, I called the bank again and told them that the transactions that I made were fraudulent and checks are not valid ones. However, the banker opened a claim for me, and she told me to wait for the status for 10 business days. I called them on XX/XX/2021 to check the status but they were so rude, and they told me that "" You made all those transactions, you got scammed why did Wells Fargo had to pay for it? '' I explained that I never experienced such a thing before and did not know that those checks are invalid since the bank approves them and made them available in my account. But she still was arguing that why I did not wait for 10 days to make sure. I explained and she hang up on me and when I called again, they did not respond back. I called them the next day and there was a guy this time and he told me that the bank will not take responsibility since those transactions were Authorized by myself and they closed the claim. I called the local police department on XX/XX/2021 and report everything the officer 's name was XXXX XXXX, her contact information are phone : XXXX ext. XXXX Email : XXXX My report # XXXX. She told me to call back the bank and have them reopen my claim. I did call the bank and told them I have a police report and gave them all of the information. However, they told me to wait for the police to investigate. My account still has overdraft, and I am an XXXX student I get my income from the loan that I get from school and have been stressing out a lot for whatever happened. My bills are past due, and I had a problem by paying my XXXX payment bills. And now Wells Fargo wants to send the debt to a collection! I believe this is not fair and I am not 100 % responsible for whatever happened."
2997,"I was the victim of a scam for a rental property. I sent money using XXXX XXXX from my bank to an account at Wells Fargo. The amount was {$1500.00} sent on XX/XX/18. I contacted Wells Fargo as soon as I found out about the scam. I provided the routing and account number where the funds were sent, and they would not provide me any information on the account/person that received the funds. Nor would they work with me in any way to try to recover the money."
2998,"I am a business owner. I was giving a check by a business i do business with. The check was stolen and someone deposited it into their personal account via atm. Wells fargo bank allowed this personal account holder to deposit a business check that wasn't made out to them into this persons personal account. Wells Fargo contacted the business I do business with and asked them who they gave the check to and they said my company name. Wells then said to put a stop payment, but it was too late. Wells Fargo 's legal fraud department contacted me and said they figured out who did it and asked me to file a police report. Then they said have the business who gave me the check file a claim, which they did. Everytime i contact Wells fargo for the status of the refund to the business i got the check with so they could give me a new check they say it is a slow process and still pending review. Its been over a month now."
3000,"Dear CFPB ; I am reporting a Wells Fargo ETF Fraud Scam on behalf of my wife and I. 

We have had all of the funds from three accounts stolen from us from our accounts via the XXXX transfer program. None of these transfers were authorized by either one of us. Our funds were transferred to a XXXX bank account. The XXXX program is added to all accounts by Wells Fargo automatically. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we went to our local bank branch in XXXX XXXX, Fl and we reported this fraud to a customer service rep and the rep said we needed to file a claim to dispute the unauthorized online XXXX transfers totaling {$870.00} that occurred on XX/XX/XXXX ( Original Claim # : XXXX ) and their fraud department would investigate the claim and let us know their decision within 7-10 business days. 

After about 10 business days, we received a letter that our claim was DENIED! The letter erroneously stated that the customer service rep said that we authorized these transfers! That was absolutely 100 % untrue!! 

After hearing this, we went to another branch on XX/XX/XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Fl XXXX branch and spoke with the branch XXXX XXXX. 

That XXXX was appalled at what they said after we told her we did NOT approve or authorize ANY of the XXXX transfers as this money was set aside for our bills and she agreed that we were wronged and she re-filed another fraud claim ( # XXXX ). We again were told that unfortunately it would be yet another 7-10 business days before we get their decision. 

The letter we received dated XX/XX/XXXX states that "" On XX/XX/XXXX, we finalized our investigation and denied the claim number XXXX. Claim number XXXX was resolved and closed. '' Also on page 2 of the same letter, it states "" On XX/XX/XXXX, we filed claim number XXXX to re-dispute unauthorized online XXXX transfers totaling {$870.00} that occurred on XX/XX/XXXX, and posted to accounts ending in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. At this time claim number XXXX is still under investigation and the resolution will be communicated to you under separate cover. '' It has now been 13 business days and we still do not have a decision! 

Under the following section on your website I read the following : Error Resolution : Unauthorized EFTs We reviewed section # 5 and that is exactly what happened, a fraudster contacted my wife on her cellphone and said he was from Wells Fargo bank and there were suspicious transfers being processed right now and he was trying to help stop that from happening and put the money back into her account and it should be back in the account within 24-48 hours. My wife did not give them ANY account information or personal information either, in fact, she asked the caller "" How do I know you are from Wells Fargo? '' He told her to look at his number and compare it to the number on the back of her card and the numbers matched. 

"" For example, the Bureau is aware of the following situations where a third party has fraudulently obtained a consumers account access information, and thus, are considered unauthorized EFTs under Regulation E : ( 1 ) a third-party calling the consumer and pretending to be a representative from the consumers financial institution and then tricking the consumer into providing their account login information, texted account confirmation code, debit card number, or other information that could be used to initiate an EFT out of the consumers account, and ( 2 ) a third party using phishing or other methods to gain access to a consumers computer and observe the consumer entering account login information. EFTs stemming from these situations meet the Regulation E definition of unauthorized EFTs. 
Updated XX/XX/XXXX '' We urgently need your help in this matter as we feel the bank has either abandoned our claim or will ultimately deny it AGAIN. 

Best Regards and God Bless"

3004,"On  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  - I was the victim of an internet scam. The fraudsters convinced me to issue a cashiers check for {$9000.00} and put it in the mail. The check would take 4 days to arrive in  HI. My friend came to my home and I discussed the matter with him and realized that it was a scam. We immediately called Wells Fargo fra ud department to stop the cashiers check after submitting all requested information we were given a case number. We then went to the  XXXX  CA branch and spoke with  XXXX   XXXX . We presented him with the stub from the cashiers check, explained what happened. He called the fraud department, closed the checking and savings accounts, blocked online access, and assured my boyfriend and myself that a hard stop had been placed on the cashiers check and that the fraudulently stolen funds would be returned in about a week.  XXXX  asked me to come in the next morning to open new accounts. I came in the next morning, opened new accounts.  XXXX  assured me that everything was safe and that the {$9000.00} would be transferred to my new account. Note - A police report was called in to  XXXX  PD since that was the location where the check was sent.     On  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  I called the claims assistance center to follow up on the status of the {$9000.00} going back to my account. They said a form was missing and that they would mail it.

3006,"I entered into an investment contract with XXXX ( the Scammer ) to transfer XXXX USD. Entering the online trading sphere comes with many hopes but due to XXXX XXXX activities and dealings, I lost my money within a very short period of time. 
I advised Wells Fargo of this fact on XX/XX/2021 and I havent received any satisfactory response so far. I am a victim of Fraud as I was under a lot of pressure and coerced through very sophisticated methods specifically created by these criminals. I reiterate that there was no trading account and no trading actually took place. This was all a scam and the recipient simply pocketed the money. My true issue with the bank is their limited understanding of the kind of recall I was consistently requesting to raise. Whilst I am not denying the demand for the reason code, I have deliberately emphasised to the bank that my case falls under a different reason code. Despite providing the bank with the required explanations of my case, Wells Fargo preferred to stick with the authorisation issue which has never been raised by me which already shows the banks lack of understanding of how to treat my case. Wells Fargo could have protected me from this ; unlike me, the bank knows about the existence of such scams and how you prey on vulnerable victims like myself, taking advantage of lack of knowledge, awareness, and circumstance."
3011,"On XX/XX/2019 I came to the Wells Fargo in XXXX XXXX in XXXX GA to initiate wire transfer for a real state transaction. The manager at the time did all the process, but she never asked me to confirm the wire information, neither she call the XXXXXXXX XXXX ( recipient bank ) to verify. She went to a second office where she came from with the paper for me to sign and the wire initialization page. 

I left the bank around XXXX that morning and two hours later the real state attorney called to ask for the wire because they didnt receive it. When I went back yo read the bank account to the lawyer immediately she knew I was being a victim of wire Fraud.

I called the Wells Fargo and asked to immediately recalled the wire ; the same lady, the manager of the branch said she called XXXX and she was informed the funds did came across to XXXX  but there was a name discrepancy and the funds were not going to be released. 

I waited the entire XXXX holiday ; i was in XXXX the next Monday and from there I called every possible department in well Fargo to make sure the money was safe and secured, because the money departed my account not on the day I initiated the wire but TWO days later, when supposedly the branchs manager had already placed an stop to the transfer. 

Only until Wednesday of that week I received a form from Wells Fargo to authorize the swift recalled. I continued waiting, The person at the wire department in Wells Fargo mentioned in 7-10 days the money shouldve being returned to my account. 

I kept in contact with the manager of the local Wells Fargo and she reassured me that the money was safe, she said one of the customer services reps. In the local XXXX  was able to log in and see that the account had two flags 1. Fraud 2. Name discrepancy. So the money was on hold and shouldve being redirected to Wells Fargo. 

XX/XX/XXXX the money departed and paid to the fraudster and the account was closed and I lost all the money. 

On mid XXXX I had to wire other funds for the same real state company, at that time I came to the same branch but another person whose last name is XXXX he followed a very strict protocol ; he asked me to call in front of him the recipient to verify the account information before he could initiated the wire transfer. I asked if this was a new procedure ; he said no, this is the normal protocol, but we had few incidents already and we have to be more strict than before, Mr XXXX didnt know I was one of the victims from those wire incidents, also the same day I came to know that supervisors from the safety department where at the branch meeting with the manager regarding wire procedures. So that specific day everything was done in the most efficient way, not at the when I sent the first wire. 

I had being after the XXXXXXXX XXXX  and Wells Fargo since the date of the incident trying to recover the money ; when I should only blame Wells Fargo for the negligence of the branchs manager that is what caused my lost. 

I bank now with XXXX for big transaction after this incident with WF, and I had sent already few wire transfers from XXXX to even XXXX and there is no time I dont received a follow up call before the wires I sent. The XXXXXXXX XXXX doesnt use office branches, all transactions are done virtually and still, I get a call for verification, twice the bank has being able to recall two wires that they dont feel comfortable to released and the funds are redirected to me. 

The Wells Fargo failed to protect me as a customer and let my money to be stolen, while there is an insurance for my account that the XXXX confirmed each account in USA has ; and still with that the bank never returned the entire amount. 

I demand the Wells Fargo to reimbursed the money the bank argues that could not retrieved because the negligence of your staff is what created my lost. 

Thank you"
3012,"I was involved in a fraudulent scam where I received a phone call from someone impersonating a XXXX XXXX sheriff. I ended up being scammed in to submitting {$3000.00}. I have tried contacting Wells Fargo about this, I have filed a police report with the XXXX XXXX Police and the XXXX XXXX Consumer Protection. NOW, it turns out the person who scammed me is actually serving a life sentence in prison in Georgia. He somehow opened a bank account in XXXX of 2022. So now the FBI is aware of the situation. I have reviewed the EFTA Regulation E as well as the CFPB and I have also had a Lawyer review these documents. It is made clear that Wells Fargo is violating the EFTA and CFPB by not refunding the {$3000.00} to me given that this was a fraud and a scam. I am asking that Wells Fargo refund the {$3000.00} and THEN WELLS FARGO can go fight with XXXXXXXX XXXX ( the scammer 's bank ) to find out how this person was able to open a bank account from prison and get {$3000.00} back from XXXX and/or the prison inmate."
