,Consumer complaint narrative
0,"I would like to make an official complaint concerning Wells Fargo Retail Services Account XXXX XXXX XXXX website and televised commercial promoting the No Interest if Paid in Full within 12 Months. I believe that the information depicted therein constitutes false advertisement and should be changed to reflect the true nature of the product. 

Both the company site and the TV ad explicitly state there is No Interest if Paid in Full within 12 Months. I bought furniture on or about XX/XX/2019. However, the first time I received a bill, 1 ) I was charged a late fees, even though I made a first payment before it was due on XX/XX/2019 ; 2 ) Payments could only be made through a Non-Wells checking account, and the online website/app you can not pay by debit/credit, money order, only checking account ; and 3 ) You a required to make monthly minimum payments or I will be charged and late fee and be reported to credit bureau! This has been consistently true with every subsequent bill as well. 

This is not a No Interest if Paid in Full within 12 Months Promotion, it is actually a High Interest/Hidden Fee Charging Retail Credit Card in disguise, that 1 ) restricts payments through mandatory non-Wells Fargo checking account only ; 2 ) charges monthly late fees if minimum monthly payments aren't made ; 3 ) charges you late fees if additional payments are made on the account in the same month instead of crediting the payments to the next payment period ; 4 ) is not a No Interest if Paid in Full because you are charged late fees for non monthly payments that are not clearly advertised. ( See attached Receipt, Advertising and Billing info. ) I would request that you remove the false information from their advertisements and the late fees and charges be removed from my account, be allowed to pay by credit/debit, money order if I choose and to have a true No Interest if Paid in Full within 12 Months account As Advertised! 

Prior to and on XX/XX/2019, I spoke with Wells Fargo regarding their deceptive advertising, restricting payments, hidden fees, etc. I was given a Complaint number by their Executive Officer representative XXXX, Ref # XXXX and told that I would get a response in 10 business days. 

Thank you. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
1,"Wells Fargo, {$80.00}, On XX/XX/XXXX the autopay on my XXXX Credit Card was turned off. I have had this card for eight years and have always had autopay on. I only found out that it was turned off upon seeing two financial charges on my credit card statement for a total of {$80.00}. Upon reaching out to Wells Fargo they Told me that I was the one that turned it off and said that they could not help me. When I asked them for information on the device that was used and the location they told me they could not give me this information. Because of this missed payment my credit score could be effected."
6,"Wells Fargo is charging me 24 % on my credit card unpaid balance for no logical, justified or apparent reason"
10,"Wells Fargo Retail Services needs to be investigated for charging erroneous charges and fraudulent sales practices for not disclosing their no interest procedures. First, I purchased furniture at XXXX in XXXX with XXXX mos no interest. They failed to disclose that the interest would be tacked on at the end of the XXXX mos in the amount of {$1200.00}. They never sent me any statements and I NEVER opted for online statements. I filed a complaint directly through Wells Fargo in XXXX of this XXXX. The escalation person only introduced themselves via email. Not once did I get a call from him. Each time I followed up via their secured email portal, I never received a reply. All they did was send me my statements. Not once did they address the interest fees. They did NOTHING! Fast forward to today, I go online to make my payment which showed a minimum payment due of {$64.00}. However, when I look at my statement it shows the minimum payment is {$230.00} with a past due amount of {$110.00}. How?????? Not only that, they have been wrongly charging me a late fee of {$40.00} every months for the past 4 months! They are FRAUDS!!!!!! I want these fees reversed ASAP!! {$1200.00} and the late fees. It is a disgrace that they would take advantage of customers."
15,"This complaint is about a Wells Fargo credit card account. My account was just closed yesterday out of blue. When I called Wells Fargo, I was told it is due to inactivity of 6 months. Funny thing is I found out about the closure when I try to activate a new replacement card of this account that Wells Fargo sent out to me a few days ago. 

The question now is first of all, Wells Fargo has never informed us as customer that the credit card would be closed due to inactivity of 6 months. We as customer wo n't have a chance to make use of the card and keep the account open. Second of all, in fact, this account has been in inactive status for about 12 months. So if they are closing card due to 6 months of inactivity, why are they closing my account now at 12 months? And why are they even sending out the replacement card for this account? 

This closure without any notice is definitely going to hurt my credit score, as it shortens  my average credit history and my available total credit line."
18,"My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX I been banking with your bank since XXXX. I had over half a million dollar in my account. I visited the XXXX office to do a transaction in XXXX XXXX. The banker took a copy of my green card and my social security office which I never understood the reason why she asked for them. Few days After I received a phone call from one of your an unethical banker from the XXXX office to apply for a credit card. I informed the unethical banker that I dont have a need to have a credit card. She informed to please get the card so she can meet her goals. I agreed to apply for regular credit card not secure card. Shortly after, I noticed a withdraw for {$5000.00} from my account. I immediately called the bank and said they applied for a secure credit card. I informed her I never agreed for the secure card. She apologized and asked me to keep the card. I never received my Wells Fargo credit card. I dont reside in the states and dont understand their system. On our last trip to USA I discovered that I am on bad credit when I applied for my son for student loan to go to XXXX XXXX. The banker asked me to pay for the card to not get my credit report damage further and instructed to file a fraud claim. I filed a fraud claim and police report over a month and half ago. No solutions been accomplished yet. I would like to bring to your attention that we were out of the country during the whole period of the card being used. Please find attached a copy of our passports and tickets. The attached documents prove that we spent from XXXX XXXX to XXXXXX/XX/XXXX in the USA. Our next trip to USA was from XX/XX/XXXX tillXX/XX/XXXXXXXX. 
My Social Security Number is XXXX. My husband by name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX also encountered the same fraud from the same banker and bank on the same day. His claim was approved and my claim was declined. 

XXXX, the times we spent in USA throughout our lives were as follows ( as proved by the documents ) Mon XXXX XXXX XXXX Till Fri XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX till XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX till XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX till XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX till XXXX XXXX XXXX As you see from the pattern of our travel, we spend around15 days in the USA every 6 months"
20,"Hello. In continuation of your response to my complaint about Wells Fargo through CFPB. 
You, instead of giving me an actual answer and resolving the issue, you are doing a training course. I do not need your guidance. 
You advertised in my account that I was pre-approved for a card, so I filled out the request and submitted it, and you told me that you would let me know through mail about your response. 
Approximately a week after that I received a letter from you regarding the application, saying that my credit was frozen with XXXX and that I needed to unfreeze my credit and call you to let you know. In order to remind you, on XX/XX/2022, I called you and told you that I unfroze my credit so you could check it. You indeed checked it, and after you had checked, and to my question, you gave me a response to freezing my credit. On that same day, XXXX points were taken from my credit. I do not need your training course and do not tell me stories or excuses. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I told you that I was not interested and was not going to unfreeze my credit for a second time because I did not my credit score to go down again and hurt my credit because this is very important to me ( you don't check 15 times, you only check credit once, you do not have the right to request from the client to open his credit in the first place for a card that he was pre-approved for, for a second time and endlessly after that ). On your mistake that you did not check my credit as you were supposed to, I do not want reconciliation, I just want my credit score back, because I do not want your card at all, and I already told you this on XX/XX/2022, that I was no longer interested in the card. 
Thus, I demand, in a clear-cut manner, that you cancel what you did on my XXXX account so that my credit score goes back to how it was prior. 
And don't keep telling me stories and legends, only relevant answers. 

Attached is a screenshot of my XXXX account, showing my credit score went down by 16 points on XX/XX/2022. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
25,"I use XXXX for shipping. XXXX would say pay XXXX rate and then upon paying would change the number to a higher number. I contacted XXXX and they did not have a viable answer. I contacted Wells Fargo to submit a claim that they accepted and reversed the charges. This continued for XXXX  months. Then Wells Fargo REVOKED my card because they said I was XXXX  the card. This action caused XXXX  of dollars in damage and weeks of labor on my part to resolve. I have physical evidence of all of this. 

Last night afetr extensive discussions with XXXX we did figure out there was a problem with their computer system and my account. My account was ported to a new account and everything work exactly as it should for shipping. 

To date Wells Fargo has not even explained why I was punished for the correct action."
26,"Back in XXXX I opened a checking account with Wells Fargo bank and deposited a settlement check. In XXXX, I deposited another large check. I opted to get a platinum credit card with a credit limit of {$500.00} initially, Wells Fargo increased the credit limit to {$1000.00} in the first five months. XX/XX/XXXX, I injured myself and have not been able to work. Wells Fargo closed the credit card account around XX/XX/XXXX and stated on my account page that I could make payments until balance is paid off. However, Wells Fargo has stopped adding late fees recently but continues to add fees and interest charges on this closed account. When I make payments, the payments are not toward the principal but the internet and fees. So far the fees are over {$200.00} in XXXX and interest is {$87.00} in XXXX. How can Wells Fargo charge interest and fees on a closed account? XXXX interested in paying off the principal balance without the fees and/or interest attached. Ive tried to explain this to Wells Fargo customer service reps to no avail. They just call and harass on a closed account. I have no problem paying the principal but how can I get my payments to go towards my principal on this closed account. Is this legal? Please someone help. I do not use this credit card since it is and has been closed."
28,I was shocked to find out my store card was closed never have I been treated like this Wells Fargo closed my retail store credit card XXXX XXXX and they didnt even inform me I found out online this is not fair
29,"Wellsfargo.com will not let me enroll to use the website for a new card. It tells me to call. I have called 5 times and no one there can fix it. They ask me the same identity verification questions and then do nothing. I have not had access since I received this card. I can not pay my bill or view any transactions because I can not access the website. 

Then they told me to go to a branch, but there are no Wells Fargo in the state of Louisiana."
34,"I have attempted to reach out to Wells Fargo on several occasions over the past month to resolve issues with my account. Each time I contacted Wells Fargo I had to provide/answer many identifiying questions including and not limited to social security number, date of birth, address, telephone numbers, work number, credit card number, credit secuirty code. I made Wells Fargo aware that I can not remeber any verbal password I provided and want this feature removed from my account since I do not recall giving a verbal password and do not want to use this feature ... To date Wells Fargo has refused to take any calls and allow me to use the account. 

Wells Fargo has refused to remove or allow me to change the verbal password and refusing to resolve the verbal password issue thus delaying use of my account. 

I believe Wells Fargo engaging in this deceptive discrimintory practice to avoid allowing customer to negoiate payments during the pandemic. I want the CFPB to enact and pass laws that allows consumer to opt out of using verbal passwords and prevent Wells Fargo from using this feature to block consumer from using and accessing account information."
35,"On or around XX/XX/2017 my secured credit card with a credit limit of {$300.00} was charged over {$1500.00} and I did not authorize that charge. How can a {$300.00} limited be charged out and the balance be over {$1800.00}? I have disputed it with the credit bureau and nothing has changed. Also, it had gotten removed from credit file for a few days but now its back on there and has drive my credit score way down again. The data on credit file isn't correct and up to date. The entire process concerning Wells forgot isn't doing anything correct and definitely causing me alot of headache with things not being right."
36,"When the store sales person applied for the card, I wasn't given any information by the XXXX 's store because a wells Fargo member called to give me the info over the phone. After all information provided I accepted the card verbally over the phone. I never saw any written contract online because the store staff did all. The Wells Fargo caller informed me I had a 12 months no interest promotion, and after this 12 months whatever balance is left I will have interests on it. That's how it is with all cards, I understand and accepted. But what happened was different. Once the 12 months came by, I was half way done paying it, Wells Fargo charged all interests back to the 12 months I've already paid, plus all interests of amount owed. That brought my account almost to stage 1, because the amount went high again, I was enable to make more than minimum payment, that resulted in lot more interests of course. Eventually, I just lost control of the account. XXXX XX/XX/2019, I made a payment for the two months that I was behind. I am requesting the conversation the Wells Fargo and I had over the phone, Wells Fargo has not provided yet, they don't want to provide I believe, because I never receive answers about that.. I tried calling more than 20 times, no one seems to care. I spoke with many different people, every time I call I have to repeat over and over again, same story. I will get a lawyer soon if this claim doesn't help, but I want to try one more time before I take drastically actions."
37,"On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo charged {$2000.00} to my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from a company called XXXX XXXX , in XXXX FL. I called them and told them I had never heard of such a company and had not done any business with them. They refused to return my money and claimed I had dealt with them. There was no phone number to make any contact. I have been fighting this cause since then. Last week I was told that my time of limitation has run out BUT I have been on this case since XXXX. 

The following year on XXXX, I was charged {$1500.00} to sell my timeshare. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, the same company, XXXX XXXX XXXX, called me and hurriedly told me they needed {$3800.00} as they were selling the property. I was confused and did not realize that I had already paid them {$1500.00} earlier that year. This was charged to my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I refused to sign the contract and asked them to cancel. 
I called Wells Fargo and asked them to refuse the charge. They told me they could n't reverse it. In doing so, they accepted the scam charge rather than supporting their client who had been with them since the sixties. I received a letter which claimed I had profited from this charge. How can they prove that? Still pursuing this all these years and the time of limitations is up. They never sold my timeshare."
42,"The website for my XXXX XXXX would not tell me my balance. There is no way for me to use this car if I don't know the balance. It now shows it is expired. However, there is a note right above the expiration date of XX/XX/22 that says FUNDS DO NOT EXPIRE. If they don't expire, why is there is expiration date on the card. And why won't the website allow me to see the balance. When I checked a few days ago, it said the status of my card was closed. No other information. What is this suppose to me. Why don't they give more information. Are they just hoping that customers don't check on these things so they can just keep hard working peoples money? 

The card is issued by Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . pursuant to license from XXXX XXXX XXXX."
43,yes XXXX XXXX put in another credit card under my information useing my ssi number fraud address u need contact her XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX
47,"Wells Fargo needs to be more honest when dealing with customers. I have been dealing and fighting with Wells Fargo for a month. The lady in the executive office on XX/XX/2019 told me in a recorded phone call that my secured card was still open. I called XXXX XXXX today and she agreed that I was right but failed to put that in the letter addressed to me and to this agency. She and Wells Fargo need to come clean and tell the truth no matter how it looks legally. It should not take over a week to close an account and if a closed request was done on the XXXX as they claim, why did the lady tell me days later that it was still open and why did she state that the two closure request did not take and the account was still open. Why did I have to find out on the XX/XX/XXXX that the account was closed? Why would they send out a replacement card on a closed account? Why would I make {$460.00} payment on a closed account? Why did it take so long and so many phone calls my me to get my secured card money back? Why did they not already decide to do training with the lady that told me that they card was open? Why should I force this as a demand from them? Who is reading the letters that Wells Fargo sends out to customers for accuracy and honesty? Wells Fargo needs to listen to the entire call and not just portions of the call like XXXX XXXX claimed she did? How can XXXX T even right a letter without listening to the entire call. 

XXXX"
50,"I attempted to make a balance transfer using a Wells Fargo transfer check attached to my credit card account. Although the debited my account the the {$1200.00} dollars it was never credited to my intended XXXX card account. I have made 5 attempts by phone to rectify the problem with Wells Fargo, and one written correspondence with no results."
52,"On XX/XX/XXXX I mistakenly transferred {$10000.00} from my non Wells Fargo checking account to my Wells Fargo credit card account. I began calling asking for the funds to be transferred back into my checking account. Each call resulted in a different outcome. I have been told on several different occasions the money would be transferred and given a date when it would happen. To date the money still sits as a positive balance in the credit card account. The last call made ended up getting handed off to someone in a different area of the company and was told it would take 30 days for the money to be returned. They take 30 seconds to accept the money,. 30 days to return it."
56,"I have a checking account with Wells Fargo from which I make payments to all of my credit cards. When I have made the recent payment from my account that has a balance of XXXX, the payment for {$140.00} ( XX/XX/20 ) was returned and as a result, I was charged an additional fee of {$29.00} + {$140.00}. When I called Wells Fargo they transferred me 2 times, each time I had to wait 45 minutes. No real solution was found. I have requested for the card to be closed and money to be refunded to me, the representative refused."
57,"I received a debit card from Wells Fargo that I never requested. I have never had an account with this Bank. 

It was a debit card not a credit card."
58,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a recurring payment of {$100.00} to my XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Card to satisfy my payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. However, the minimum payment amount was actually {$100.00}. I failed to realized that my payment amount had increased after a recent purchase. In late XXXX I received a collection notice stating my account was past due. I called the collections department to confirm they had received my XXXX payment that cleared my bank account two weeks prior to the due date. I was informed of the payment shortage and acknowledged that I failed to adjust my monthly recurring payment after a recent purchase that increased my balance. I stated that I would make a one off payment immediately to bring the account current ( a {$30.00} payment posted to my credit card account on XX/XX/XXXX ). I asked the representative to reverse the {$27.00} late fee as a one time customer service gesture. The representative agreed. On XX/XX/XXXX I logged in to my online account to check the balance for a promotional financing offer that I knew was expiring soon. At that time I noticed that there had been no adjustment made for the {$27.00} late fee that was assessed on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I called customer service to explain the issue and spoke to three different representatives who stated that there was not record of a promise to waive the fee and furthermore they would not be able to reverse the fee. I even requested to have the fee reversed on sheer principle since I 've been a long term customer, have never been late and always pay my promotional financing in full before they expire ; all separate from the fact it 's quite egregious to charge {$27.00} for a {$7.00} partial payment shortage. I was finally transferred to a resolution analyst who stated someone would review and get back to me before XX/XX/XXXX. At this rate, the expense that they 've incurred via several phone calls that were each in excess of 10 minutes and the value of time I 've personally spent - far more than {$27.00} has been exhausted. This issue could have been easily resolved and I 'd be a happy customer with the first call, I 'm ok with the oversight and the need to make a second call but at this point the lack of service is unacceptable."
60,"They recently responded with proof of delivery, but that is NOT MY NAME not my SIGNATURE and I live by myself, Why am I trying so hard back and forth think? because of course am truthful here and no matter what I will complain 10 more times next to OCC anything for me to make this fair for myself. in the response, Wells Fargo is claiming their employee did not misbehave or hung up the phone on me? THAT IS A LIE. i was trying to tell XXXX if I can speak to the case officer she said NO I asked her what can I do she said well NOTHING. wells Fargo can not just say OHH nothing and leave me liable for something I never received. forgery of the signature of the driver has handed the package to someone entirely different and they do not want to take liability. 

- ) I informed in time as soon as I found out my package was lost.

- ) visa is saying they can't help because the merchant is showing the proof of delivery? WHAT PROOF? MY NAME? NO, MY SIGNATURE? NO NOTHING. 
- ) the merchant needs to file a claim with XXXX and recover with them because they took an extra {$40.00} from me for a SECURE delivery which they did not do I can not be put liable for this I will come back with this complaint back and forth. Until you are more than welcome to call me and discuss with me if you are confused. 

*previous communication is attached below. 

on XX/XX/XXXX i called wells Fargo reporting a purchase issue with XXXX for {$3800.00}. Where I paid an extra {$40.00} to XXXX for a secured delivery to me and the parcel to be only released to me but anybody else i did that because of the amount of the purchase and i wanted to be secured from my end. On the XXXX of XXXX, i was at home waiting for my parcel to arrive, XXXX never showed up and i received an email from XXXX saying that the parcel was delivered to the address i freaked out and checked the tracking, It said it was delivered NO SIGNATURE WAS OBTAINED AND SOME RANDOM DELIVERY NAME AS XXXX was mentioned, For secured delivery XXXX is required to check the ID of the person before they release it. I freaked out so much as it is my life 's very first investment i called wells Fargo and reached out to XXXX and XXXX .. XXXX said that the sender could file a claim with us as a receiver i could not do anything. I called XXXX they said they will look into it since then never replied, Wells Fargo initiate my dispute on the XXXX of XXXX with dispute details Dispute Number : XXXX Date Posted : XX/XX/2022 Merchant Name : XXXX, XXXX. Amount of Transaction : XXXX Card Number : XXXX Status : Dispute Initiated Wells Fargo called me on XX/XX/XXXX saying they are going to decline my dispute, I spoke to XXXX from the claims department, and She was insulting, I was trying to understand how can i put liable for something i did nothing wrong - ) I paid extra on top of the total price of the product. - ) i informed my bank less than 24 hours after the incident. - ) i replied to every call wells Fargo had for me. even after all of this, she was so rude to me that SHE HUNG UP ON ME WHILE I WAS TALKING. and just yesterday they posted the charge back onto my account. I want to know where was i wrong? how am i liable? I am a fulltime XXXX XXXX  it was my life 's first investment and i have now been left with nothing they putting me liable for something i never received. What about visa customer rights. XXXX did not deliver what they promised. Please help me Please."
62,"I received a letter dated XXXX XXXX ( as attached ) from Wellsfargo saying I own money to XXXX 's XXXX ending XXXX. In fact, I paid off all balances on site ( right after each purchasing by using the card. I have not used this card for years, and I have never received any card statements either via mailing or electronically for years. in the afternoon of XXXX XXXX, I visited Wellsfargo XXXX and at the branch I called the number listed in the letter - XXXX - XXXX and asked for all details but with no answers. Then I was told by a banker that 1 ) the card was closed/expired and 2 ) I paid the card {$10000.00} on XX/XX/2022. I could not find any records paying this amount, and I am attaching my XX/XX/2022 bank account statement, this account is the only payment method I can think of. And the banker asked me report this financial fraud."
66,"I received 3 credit cards in the mail I did not apply for. I thought they were junk mail until I opened them on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX. All three accounts sent me physical credit cards.

Wells Fargo sent a statement with a {$0.00} balance. 

I called each company and successfully closed & blocked the credit card as well as open an investigation into the fraud activity. 

- XXXX XXXX closed Saturday XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX closed Saturday XXXX - Wells Fargo closed Monday XXXX I also received a notification from XXXX XXXX  declining an application "" due to number of recent inquiries on consumer report agency '' XXXX was listed. 

I am not sure if there are other fraudulent accounts open in my name in addition to the three listed above."
68,Wells Fargo sent out super checks with promotional material that said that I would have no interest for any check I used for 15 months and that there would be a 4 % upfront fee. I wrote one check for {$10000.00} in XXXX and one for {$3000.00} in XXXX. The 4 % ( {$540.00} ) was added to my balance. I paid off any regular credit card charges every month but I kept on being charged interest. I called and they told me that was just how the system worked. I have called multiple times and have been progressively moved up the chain but the answer remains the same. The super checks totaled {$14000.00} and my current balance is {$13000.00} and I continue paying interest every month even though I stopped charging anything on my account months ago. My complaint is how can I owe interest when the balance is lower than the amount I wrote the checks for plus the 4 %. And if it is just the way the system works then how many of the thousands of other people who did this are also getting charged interest on their no interest supercheck offer?
69,"I signed up for the Wells Fargo XXXX credit card that advertises 1x point per {$1.00} spent on rent. After a HARD PULL on my credit, I am informed that I ALSO have to make a minimum of XXXX transactions on the credit card per month to get any points added on to my account ( the rent payment does NOT count )."
70,"Hello, I live in XXXX. I have a credit card with Wells Fargo, which I have had for over 10 years. I also have a deposit account ( Checking + Savings ) linked to that credit card. 

On XXXX I received a letter informing me that my deposit account will be closed for the following reason : "" Our records reflect that the above-referenced account has one or more account holders with a non-US address on file which does not meet this new requirement. '' The XXXX of the problem : My credit card with Wells Fargo has an outstanding balance on it which I pay monthly. Without a deposit account, I have no way to make a payment on that credit card. 

I work for a XXXX company and am paid my salary in XXXX into a XXXX XXXX account. Once a month, I send yen to my Wells Fargo Checking account and use that to pay my credit card. Without a deposit account, there is no way for me to transfer that payment to my credit card balance. My account will accrue interest and eventually ruin my credit. 

How is this possible? How is it legal for a bank to delete your ability to give them money, and then charge interest on a balance they know you have the means but no procedure available by the bank itself to pay? 

I can not visit a branch. There is no branch in this country. To fly to the nearest branch, I would need to buy an airplane ticket that costs the same as my credit card balance ... with a credit card. 

It should be noted that both my Wells Fargo checking, savings, and credit card accounts have long had my XXXX address attached. They mail my statements here. 

On XXXX I spoke with the Wells Fargo Checking and was heavily pressured and berated to give verbal authorization to close the account. I refused until they could tell me how I can continue to pay my linked credit card product. 

I then spoke with Wells Fargo Internal `XXXX Credit Card Advocacy Group '' ( XXXX ) and expressed the same concern. They created case # XXXX and promised to follow up. As of today, they haven't contacted me at all. 

I am being placed in a situation, designed by Wells Fargo, where they have boarded up the deposit window to my line of credit to let the account accrue interest and fees. It would be funny if it were a joke in a XXXX comedy. 

This is super messed up. Help. 

EDIT : When I set my home address country to "" XXXX '' your online form returns error : "" Failed to save complaint ''. When I set it to United States, it allows me to send the complaint. My country is XXXX, my state is XXXX, XXXX XXXX and my Zip is XXXX. It is the same as the attached document. The fact that I can't submit the complaint with my address is also... super messed up. Will you actually help?"

86,"When I opened a checking account at Wells Fargo in XXXX of 2004, at XXXX years old, they opened a credit card in my name as well without my permission. I noticed it when they were also charging me for their rewards program, for a card I didn't apply for. I called them to stop the charges and had to threaten them to get them to remove the rewards program charges, but the damage was done and the card was opened. Closing the account would only hurt my credit score, so I left it open but never used it once in the almost 11 years it was open."
90,I have a lot of unauthorized transactions
94,"Lately, past few months noticed my interest was {$68.00} on {$3300.00} balance. Is n't this way too high. I pay {$100.00} a month and only get accounted for only a few dollars. This past statement was for Wells Fargo, billing period XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Something has to be wrong. This is ridiculous."
95,"I have been a customer of Wells Fargo since XXXX having recently closed my bank accounts due to these ongoing issues. I procured my WF credit card in XXXX and it has been down hill since then. Wells Fargo is mismanaging my credit card and you need to know this. Payments have disappeared, money has not been credited to account, automatic payment form has a forged signature, and credit line changed without contact, and more. This mismanagement is so egregious that their own employees have agreed that there has been improper handling of this account. 

I have been dealing with issues on the credit card for three years and nothing has been resolved. Talked with three different people in executive office, numerous branch officials, and countless phone customer service agents. This led me to close accounts with WF to never bank there again. 

This is in line with their previous illegal practices which I do not mind seeking litigation for this issue."
98,"I was notified by XXXX that a transaction was made for {$3400.00} to an merchant unknown by me so I file a fraud claim with the bank, They made a provisional credit to my account after calling the claims department several times and also visiting the bank a few time more about this issue. Then this weekend of XX/XX/2022, I received a letter after a period of about 2 weeks of their investigation that they had decided that I authorized the transaction or approved some else to make the transaction, and so they denied my claim. I am very angry about this as I DID NOT make or authorized this transaction using my ATM card. I further call the bank to cancel that card in question, and they send me another card in about 10 days. I have until XX/XX/2022 when my account will be debited for this amount unless I can get them to investigate this claim further, as it was deemed closed stated in the letter from the bank."
101,I called Wells Fargo today to make a payment with the same account information I make it with every month for the past 5 is years. I verified over 5 pieces of information like I do every month and have been doing for the past 5 years. Today they refused to take my payment from the account I gave them verifying the routing number and the bank name. The manager stated she would notate my account to make it more difficult for me to call In and make future payments even though I had correctly verified all the information where my payment was coming from.

XX/XX/XXXX I received an email stating suspicious transaction on my account. I called the number in the email and was phished for info that resulted in an online wire transfer for XXXX, a combination of XXXX from WF credit card and XXXX from a checking account. 

Wells Fargo denied the fraud claim no reasons given. While on the phone reporting the fraud the representative explained to me how this happened and requested the email I received. I sent the email to the address she gave me. At the time it seemed like WF knew this was fraud and were there to help but the letter sent denied the claim and said there was no fraud found. I have several first names from WF fraud dept but no last names as they will not give them. Ironically I have the first and last name of the person who I thought was WF but was actually the person committing the fraud. 

I am out XXXX and I do not have the money to pay it back and XXXX was mime for my mortgage payment. 

I have claim numbers and account numbers. The Credit Card has been terminated and a new card has been issued and the XXXX has been transferred to the new card by Wells Fargo."

109,"I recently asked for copies of my statements dating back from 2016 because I was denied a credit increase as a result of late fees on my account. Upon review of my statements, I see that Wells Fargo continued to charge me late fees even when payments were received. Payments were made via phone, online or mailed in over the years, in some cases, twice a month. 

I am requesting fee returns of {$360.00}, {$220.00}, {$280.00} and {$36.00} respectively after reviewing my records and payment dates. With the issues Wells Fargo has encountered recently, I see this as another avenue they were defrauding clients. I will seek legal help to review my options as well."
110,"To Whom it may concern, In 2016 I went with an employee of my newly started company to open bank accounts at Wells Fargo. ( The same bank I use for my personal accounts ) While going through the process of opening the business checking account, the business account representative suggested I open a credit card account to help build the credit of the business. 

He explained it was an easy process as I personally had good credit etc. So I said Ok. 

So he ran my credit explained the type of account that would be good for me and then suggested I can get a card for your employee as well. 
I again said sure that would be great. He then asked for her home address and social. 
I asked why he needed that information? 
As did my employee ... as she explained she didn't want him to run her credit. 

He assured us that was not the case that this was just basic information needed for her company card and that the credit account would be under my name and business and he would not run her credit. 

She again pressed as did I .... I don't feel comfortable giving my social ... and I followed up buy saying ... As long as you arent running her credit. 
He again assured us that was not the case. 

He then said you are approved for a XXXX dollars limit. 
I asked if this card had any strange fees or or any type of loop holes I should be aware of. He again assured me that it didn't. 

He then printed out a couple of sheets that we had sign. ( No long form costumer agreement etc ) An that was it. 

Almost immediately issues began. My employee was getting statements sent to her home. We came to find out that the accounts had been split XXXX to her and XXXX to me. That this was not a basic company card. 

I called Wells Fargo and asked why she was getting statements sent to her house? They explained it was nothing more than a mistake. That it would stop. It didn't then ... and hast not stopped in 4 years. 

My employee soon after left the business for another job and returned the card. 
But continued to receive statements. 

I kept calling Wells Fargo asking them to stop sending statements to her home. They would assure me they would. Then I would get a message from my former employee with a picture of another statement. 

I would call and ask again for them to stop. They would again sure me they would stop .... and the same pattern would repeat itself. 

Then I asked them to put the XXXX dollar line of credit back on my card ... .. hoping this would remove her name from the accounts. 
They said they would try. Then explained that it was not possible to do so when I pressed even further. Though couldn't give me a strait answer as to why. 

The statements kept coming to my former employee after I had been assured by costumer service higher ups it would stop. They didn't. 

Then the business began to struggle and I was late on a payment. 1 day after being late they began calling my former employee demanding payment. She explained to the person on the phone she hadn't worked for me in years. The Wells rep explained she was liable for the debt. 

It was then after calling numerous times I finally went to a Wells Fargo branch to speak to someone in person. 
I was there for almost 3 hours while a rep called different people trying to get to the bottom of this. 

Finally we were able to find out that my former employee was put into the Wells Fargo computer system as a Co-Owner of my business. Even though Wells Fargo higher ups had sent us the paperwork while I was sitting in the bank that showed clearly that she is NOT an owner on the paperwork that I gave to Wells with my EIN and LLC info. 

It was then explained to me that she would be removed as an owner of the business from Wells Fargos files as we now had the proof ( in their own Documents that showed that was false ) and the statements and calls would stop. They didn't ... ... 

I then called again and again over months. 
I was sent to different departments and higher up reps until it was revealed to me that it was not just that she had been put into the computer as an owner of the business ... ..but that she was added to the account as a credit guarantor without either of our knowledge!!!!!! 
That in fact I did NOT qualify personally for the line of credit he offered me that day and the only way he could get it approved was by making her a credit guarantor ... .. that came directly from a Wells Fargo Rep. 
That is why he took her SS number as well as her home address and was also why she was receiving statements and phone calls for delinquent payments. 

She is still receiving statements as of XX/XX/XXXX and calls to this day. They have not stopped. 

I then found out that this CC actually came with a MAJOR drawback. 

When I asked if there was any drawbacks or things I should be concerned about or aware of. The rep assured me there wasn't. He lied a 2nd time. 

This card comes with the caveat that is you are late twice in one year .... you are penalized not just a lie fee .... but your APR goes up to 28.9 percent for 1 FULL YEAR and will not be reduced!!!! 
I would have never taken a CC with that type of pitfall .... and again the rep said there were none to worry about. 

So to recap. 
1 : This Wells Fargo Rep lied to us personally and then falsified my application in their system by listing my employee as a Co-Owner of my business and a Credit Guarantor without our knowledge. 
By doing so I was given an account that I didn't qualify for. Wells Fargo after years of trying to work it out with them has not remedied the situation. 

2 : He also lied and said there were no issues or major pitfalls to be concerned about in regards to this CC. I now have a 28 percent APR for late payments and Wells Fargo has refused to help. After again admitting that I should never have been given this account in the first place. 

I have attached proof my former Employee is still receiving statements. As well as the documents given to wells fargo showing clearly XXXX is NOT an owner of the business. 

As well as the signed Documents that we were given that day which clearly show NOTHING about her being a credit guarantor nor the APR hike for late payments. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Sincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NJ XXXX"
113,"This involves Wells Fargo Bank. 
On XX/XX/2022 fraudulent cash advances were made on two separate credit cards. These cash advances were transferred to my business checking account ( by the person committing the fraud ) from which a fraudulent wire transfer was made. I notified representatives at Wells Fargo within minutes of the fraud taking place. 3 months have gone by and Wells Fargo has yet to correct the situation. 

Business credit card ending in XXXX in the amount of {$9000.00} and personal credit card ending in XXXX in the amount of {$8000.00}. These cash advance funds were transferred without my approval to the business checking account ending in XXXX from which the {$17000.00} fraudulent wire transfer was made. 

Over the last three months Wells Fargo has been dragging their feet addressing my claim. They replaced both credit cards and transferred the fraudulent cash advance amounts to the new cards. Since representatives at Wells Fargo were unavailable to discuss the lack of action on their part, I used my own funds ( admittedly in a bit of a panic ) to pay down the new credit card balances to protect my credit rating. Wells Fargo now claims that since the credit card balances are essentially XXXX, "" restitution '' has been made. They refuse to acknowledge that MY funds were used and that I ( the victim ) am in no position to provide restitution. 

Most recent Wells Fargo parties involved : XXXX XXXX : XXXX ( Business credit card ). 
XXXX : XXXX XXXX ( Consumer credit card ) Please address this issue and explain why Wells Fargo shouldn't provide restitution for fraudulent credit card charges."

I went to the bank to inquire about the credit card and found that the bank suspended my credit card because of a separate issue. I asked the banker how can I fix this issue with the XXXX XXXX account and get back in good standings with the bank and release the hold on my credit card? the XXXX XXXX Department name : ( XXXX XXXX ) associate account resolution representative, denied given me an option to get back in good standing.

123,"Wells Fargo denied my credit card application because I didnt have a green card ( I have a work visa ) The  requirement of having a green card was not disclosed to me before doing a hard credit pull. My credit score was negatively affected as a result.

127,"I placed an order on XXXX and returned the items because they did not fit. XXXX provided me with a return label and the return was requested and shipped back within the 30 day return period. In addition, the return tracking # shows that the items were DELIVERED BACK TO XXXX and if you see in the attached photos of my chat conversation with XXXX and my emails, XXXX even CONFIRMED the packages were received. They said in the chat photo attached that it takes 14 business days to process the refund and to reach back out if I still do not receive my refund by then. It had been longer than 14 business days so I reached back out to them and they said that yes, they received my return, but now they can not find it in their warehouse so they cant process my refund. This is NOT my problem. I did what I was supposed to do, return the items. They can not steal my money like this because of a failure in their warehouse! 

XXXX then denied the claim saying they can't load XXXX XXXX tracking numbers which is very easily done on XXXX. They said they can only do XXXX, XXXX and XXXX which is false. In addition, they denied my claim and NEVER informed me of the denial. I reached out to XXXX on NUMEROUS occasions and they said they were still working on it when in fact they already had denied the claim.

129,I opened a wells fargo cash rewards card off an add on XXXX 's website. the ad promised a {$200.00} cash back reward as soon as i charged {$1000.00}. which i did in XX/XX/2017. When i called them they routed my call to the wrong department then that lady ( XXXX  ) refused to give me any information on my account. and would not transfer me to anyone who could or would be able to help me. Wells Fargo engaged in false and or misleading statements to get me to open a credit card and is now refusing to provide the rewards for 4 or more months. what kind of crooks are they? I demand that they send me my {$200.00} cash reward immediately You should also note that wells fargo engages in so much fraud on has to wonder if they are paying the CFPB to remain open so they can continue to defraud Americans.
133,I have been battling this unverified and inaccurate account for awhile now and this haven't been proven whatsoever. The information across the reporting bureaus are different from each other implying that this account have different values and information.

137,"This is with Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX credit card. I recently applied and received this new card with promotion of 18 month 0 interest on APR of general purchases. 

On XX/XX/2017, I had a cash advance of {$850.00}, with understanding of cash advance will not have the 0 interest promotion, I paid {$1000.00} right back three days later. And I thought based on regulation, any payment above min payment will go to higher interest debit first, which in this case will be applied to the cash advance first. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, there is a {$8.00} cash advance interest posted in my account. When I called Wells Fargo, they said unless I pay the total current balance of the whole card ( which includes general purchases which should have enjoyed 0 interest, there will always be a balance for my cash advance. So apparently the {$1000.00} I paid was not applied to the higher interest balance. Is Well Fargo 's practice lawful?
Thanks,"

139,"I was in the process of selling my home and buying a new home. A very stressful and highly agitated time in my life, eating away at my time, life and energy. I needed to find a mover. Most movers at the time weren't available due to the summer season. I came across an ad on the internet about a moving company, I called the number and spoke to what I believed was an actual moving company. They told me that they could move me when all the well known movers couldn't, I was desperately needing to move due to my house closing at the end XXXX, when I contacted them at the end of XXXX. The move date was over a month in advance. Most of my transaction conversations were done on the phone. I was trying to juggle working at my job while this was all happening and fielding a lot of calls from work, realtors and now this moving company, which the moving brokers kept calling. Long story short, I believed them to be movers, I gave them my credit card number as a down payment of {$5300.00}, but they were not movers, they were brokers. I only found out because I was too busy to read the contract due to my limited time, they had told me some one was going to reach out to me in 3 to 4 days to solidify the move, when they did not, I got concerned I was scammed, and went to look at their contract to see, yes, I was scammed, and no one called me, therefore mitigating their UNCONSCIONABLE Contract. I was shock to find out they weren't movers, more shocked to find they had when I believe to be a highly unethical contract, and researched on XXXX and the XXXX XXXX XXXX showed me that this is a very dirty business doing this to hundreds to thousands of people. I went about cancelling this move with these scammers, thieves, and went directly to my bank to cancel and dispute the transaction because I wasn't going to be utilizing them. This contract is UNCONSCIONABLE- All this is what I went through with these movers : Undue influence ; XXXX ; Unequal bargaining power ; Unfair surprise ; or Limiting warranty. 
My Bank, Wells Fargo, had took over 6 months to give me an answer for the dispute. They claim because I signed this contract that I am stuck with the {$5300.00}, even though this horrible moving brokers did NOTHING for me! They did not find me any movers, I found my own. They did nothing for that {$5300.00} that they STOLE from me, and my bank Wells Fargo has allowed these scammers to do this.

I canceled immediately after sign up in XX/XX/XXXX, as I began to read the fraud of XXXX XXXX. They refused to cancel and continued billing my account monthly. I contacted Wells Fargo several times to file a dispute to unauthorized charging continuing on my account with the merchant refusing to stop. There was no contract. I asked Wells Fargo to block the merchant which they failed to handle as well. Finally, after a year Wells Fargo disputed it and sent back the last three charges as unauthorized charges. When Wells Fargo finally entered the dispute over a year later, they only credited the last three months ( shown above ). 
I filed cases with the Executive Office, but to no avail. This is Wells Fargo 's responsibility as they failed to stop the charges, block the merchant to stop future charges and file a timely dispute when brought to their attention that they needed to help this matter and to credit the account early on for unauthorized charges"

146,I was fraudulently charged a purchase of XXXX cell phones made by some random individual who lives in Indiana over a year ago.

I have over XXXX calls into Wells Fargo yet they keep bringing me around the same circle and the case never moves forward and it is not dropped even though they know these were not my charges. This has also done damage to credit score. If someone from the public can read stay as far away from Wells Fargo as possible.
148,"I called to do a balance transfer with Wells Fargo. I confirmed with customer service that I could submit a another balance transfer in the already open transfer and was told that I had one year to make more transfers. I asked how much I could transfer. She let me know that my limit was {$1500.00} but if I wanted to transfer more, I would need to increase my credit line. I agreed to increase as I have excellent credit. 
I was transferred to the department that handles increases in credit limits. My limit was increased to {$10000.00} and a hard pull on my credit was executed. 
I asked to handle the balance transfer and was transferred back to the customer service department where I was then told my another representative that I could not make any balance transfers. 

I was then escalated and transferred to a supervisor for the mistake who submitted the claim. I confirmed that if I signed up For another Wells Fargo account with a balance transfer Offer ; I would be able to transfer a balance. 

But now that I have a {$10000.00} limit this will effect me being able to obtain any more lines of credit and a significant balance ( not just {$1500.00} ) I submitted my complaint and no one could tell me what the options for resultions were. They simply stated they could not reverse the credit limit increase nor could they give me a balance transfer.

151,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I used a new Wells Fargo credit card to finance a purchase through XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$6700.00}. This purchase was to have no interest if paid in full within 15 months ( by XX/XX/XXXX ). My minimum monthly payment was {$230.00}, however, I immediately began making monthly payments of {$450.00} ( which was above the monthly minimum ) to ensure this purchase was paid off within the 15-month timeframe. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I used my existing Wells Fargo credit card to finance a second purchase through XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$10000.00}. This purchase is to have no interest if paid in full within 15 months ( by XX/XX/XXXX ). 
The following month, I received one statement from Wells Fargo. This statement included a single minimum monthly payment ( {$420.00} ) and my total balance on the credit card based on the two purchases I had made net what I had paid thus far. While my minimum monthly payment had increased, which was to be expected due to the higher balance, the statement did not indicate that each purchase required a separate minimum payment due each month, nor did it explain, or provide me with a way to choose, how my payment would be allocated between the two purchases. Without this level of detail, it was impossible for me to know whether or how my payments would be allocated. I continued to make monthly payments of {$450.00}, which exceeded the {$420.00} minimum monthly payment amount. My intent was to pay more than the minimum required on the two purchases combined, as determined and represented by Wells Fargo, so that I could maintain the benefit of the no interest provision for the first purchase. Based on the above and the fact that I made monthly payments in excess of the minimum monthly payment determined by Wells Fargo, it was reasonable to assume that Wells Fargo was appropriately allocating my payments in a manner that would maintain the no interest provision for the first purchase. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, after I believed I had made my final payment towards the first purchase, deferred interest was added to my account in the amount of {$1600.00}. When I realized this had occurred, I called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX to discuss what I believed to be a mistake. When I was told by XXXX XXXX sp? ) that it was not a mistake and a portion of my monthly payment had been applied to my second purchase, I offered to pay off the first purchase that day if the interest was waived. When my offer was rejected, I asked to be transferred to a supervisor. I then spoke with XXXX and again offered to pay off the first purchase that day if the interest was waived, which she also rejected. XXXX stated that I was required to make a minimum monthly payment towards each purchase as my purchases were considered two different loans. When I explained that was never communicated to me or noted in the statements I received, I was told that I should have known based on the increased minimum monthly payment, however, that monthly payment is not broken out between the purchases anywhere on the statements I received. When I asked why I did not receive two separate statements if these were two separate loans requiring two separate minimum monthly payments, XXXX stated that Wells Fargo sent one statement because the purchases were on XXXX credit card/account, furthering my point that I was under the impression I only had to make XXXX minimum monthly payment on the account. 
XXXX went on to say that my payment would be applied to the XXXX different minimum monthly payments, with any excess being applied towards my first purchase. Assuming ( because, again, this is not noted anywhere on my statement ) that explanation is accurate, the minimum monthly payment for my first purchase would be {$230.00} and the minimum monthly payment for my second purchase would be {$180.00} ( based only on the difference between my original minimum monthly payment and my increased minimum monthly payment as of XX/XX/XXXX, as this is not noted on my statement ). However, in XXXX XXXX, Wells Fargo allocated {$77.00}, {$76.00}, {$450.00}, {$450.00}, {$450.00}, and {$250.00}, respectively, to my first purchase. This clearly refutes XXXX statement that I had two separate minimum monthly payments and her explanation of how my monthly payments had been allocated. In XXXX and XXXX, the alleged minimum monthly payment ( {$230.00} ) was not applied to my first purchase, while in XXXX there was {$0.00} applied to the alleged minimum monthly payment ( {$180.00} ) on my second purchase. 
It is clear that Wells Fargo has arbitrarily applied my payments between my two purchases, which ultimately led to deferred interest being added to my account, and such interest has continued to accrue. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a XXXX demand letter to Wells Fargo stating that I suffered a loss of {$1700.00} ( the total interest applied to my account in XXXX ( {$1600.00} ) and XXXX ( {$56.00} ) ) due to their unclear, misleading, and intentionally vague credit card statements, and their arbitrary allocation of my payments. I also enclosed a check for {$280.00} labeled as payment in full for the balance remaining on my first purchase net the interest unfairly applied. Wells Fargo cashed this check, however, they also reduced my autopay amount for that month without my permission. It was my intent that the check, which was a completely separate payment, be an additional payment to my autopay, which had been set to pay {$450.00} each month since my account was opened. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX Office Case XXXX at Wells Fargo, sent a response letter offering to waive {$1200.00} in interest charges if I made an additional payment, however, I contend that no interest is owed on my account and did not make the payment to accept the offer. I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and left a message asking to discuss the offer, but she did not return my call. Of note, XXXX response letter did little to explain how my payments were allocated, other than to say that [ they ] applied [ my ] payments correctly. The letter goes on to say that I could have paid more towards my balance each month, however, I have no way to know and I highly doubt that any additional amounts paid would have been applied towards my first purchase to ensure it was paid off by the termination of the no interest period. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo removed {$1300.00} in interest charges from my account, but added {$35.00} in interest. While I appreciate this gesture, I still insist that no interest is owed on my account. To date, {$1800.00} in interest charges were applied to my account ( {$1600.00}, {$56.00}, {$45.00}, and {$35.00} from XXXX respectively ) with only {$1300.00} waived."
152,"Wells Fargo closed my account due to two payments being returned. The payments were returned because the linked bank account was compromised from a lost debit card, which I did not know when I made the payments. I have always made all of my payments on time and have never had a late payment. Even after Wells Fargo closed the account, I continued to make on time payments and the balance on the account bringing the account within terms of the cardholder agreement. The account is planned to be paid off with a {$0.00} balance by the end of the month. As a XXXX XXXX we sometimes do not get communication that our accounts may be compromised."
156,In 2020 Wells Fargo had to change our account number for fraudulent XXXX charges. It started all over again and for months I have called and sent 2 certified letters to have them stop these changes. I also sent a certified letter to XXXX no one will help me.
157,"People rely on the credit decisions of major banking institutions when making financial decisions. On Saturday XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Wells Fargo about increasing the credit limit on my XXXX  Card ending in XXXX from {$5000.00} to {$10000.00}. My complaint is that the customer representative lied to me. He told me that my request to increase the credit limit to {$10000.00} had been APPROVED. However, I later received a letter from Wells Fargo explaining that the credit limit was only increased by a mere {$1300.00} to {$6300.00}. I want a transcript of these recorded phone conversations with an explanation as to why the bank LIED to me on the phone. 

Here is a summary of the major facts : 1 ) I originally requested an increase in my credit limit from {$5000.00} to {$10000.00}, The bank offered to increase my credit limit to {$6300.00}. This did not feel right but I accepted. However, I voiced my concern to the Wells Fargo banking professional. I explained that I i ) had a high income ii ) owned my own residential house with no mortgage, iii ) owned two cars iv ) had no student loans, and v ) no credit card debt. When I expressed my concern that discrimination played a role in the lower credit limit, the Wells Fargo representative indicated that I could be transferred to another department at the bank to request this additional increase in my credit limit. The decision to accept the original {$1300.00} increase did NOT preclude me from asking for the larger increase from {$5000.00} to {$10000.00}. 

2 ) The 2nd representative indicated that the previous decision to increase my credit limit {$1300.00} was done without pulling my credit report. I was told that there would be a significant wait for the results, However, I am a patient person and decided to be placed on hold for an extended period of time. At the end long hold, the Wells Fargo representative confirmed that I had been APPROVED for a {$10000.00} credit limit. I had him repeat this statement and he indicated that the additional credit limit would be available the next day. 

Unfortunately, Wells Fargo is DISHONEST and never increased the credit limit to {$10000.00}. I received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX indicating that this request for additional credit had been denied, The letter was dated XX/XX/XXXX. As a result, the Wells Fargo representative knew that my request to increase the credit limit had been denied. However, he did not tell the truth, He lied to me. We will never know why Wells Fargo couldn't increase the credit limit for someone with a high income, a good credit score, and no debt. However, the consumer financial protection bureau should request these phone transcripts and penalize the bank for being dishonest. The government should not tolerate large banks lying to customers, Wells Fargo wants to pretend that the original {$1300.00} increase in the credit limit precluded me from requesting another increase in the credit limit. However, the 1st Wells Fargo employee indicated that she was surprised my credit limit increase was not granted She transferred me to the second representative who knew about this earlier increase in the credit limit. However, no one indicated that this earlier increase precluded me from requesting a larger increase based on an actual credit report. Wells Fargo continues to mislead customers, It's unethical the make verbal statements on the phone that are *immediately* contradicted by a letter that is dated the SAME DAY,"

161,"On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a complaint. Complaint # XXXX about WELLS FARGO CARD SERVICES. Wells Fargo had charged my mother, an XXXX year old woman with XXXX XXXX XXXX   for services like Life Insurance that would pay off her credit card balance when she passed away ; two accidental death insurances, and a Preferred membership program for discounts to concerts and such [ REALLY! What is an XXXX  year old going to do with this? ]. Wells Fargo then raised my mother 's interest rate to 18.35 % and continued to charge her from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, all the while the balance went from around {$2800.00} to over {$8000.00}. Then they cancelled the Life Insurance that would pay off the credit card when she passed away. I sent Wells Fargo my Power of Attorney and made many phone calls. Wells Fargo stated they did not have the Power of Attorney and would not speak to me. I went to lawyers who stated there was nothing I could do. I went to the Office of the Controller of Currency ( OCC ) who told me to contact the CFPB. Finally, I found someone who helped me. I filed a formal complaint and Wells Fargo responded. They sent a letter stating they have had my Power of Attorney since XX/XX/XXXX. They also removed most of the Life Insurance charges and the preferred membership charges. The bill was brought down to {$1100.00}.

My current complaint is # 1Wells Fargo was asked to remove those services but are continuing to bill for them. My sister made a payment of {$200.00} on the balance of {$1100.00} and the balance is now {$1100.00}. When I called Wells Fargo to find out about the charges and why only {$10.00} was put toward the bill ( where did the other {$190.00} go? ) the Wells Fargo phone rep stated that was interest and there were charges put on but then they were taken off. But why then is the balance {$1100.00}?

# 2 When Wells Fargo removed the charges for services over ten years, they kept the interest they charged for those bogus services for all ten years. WHY? Shouldn't the interest have been refunded as well?

I am grateful for what you have done for me at CFPB. Can you please investigate Wells Fargo and ask them to return my mother 's interest?"
162,"When I went into Wells Fargo Bank to cash a {$340.00} check, I made a payment on my Wells Fargo credit card inside the bank. 

While this transaction was being made, the young lady was running her mouth, while handing my funds. 

This is not my first time making payments on my credit card in this bank. 

When checking my credit card two weeks later, that's when I notice my payment wasn't applied to my account."
163,"First wells fargo sent me a denial letter. Upon calling to inquire they asked me for a copy of my social security and bank statements, upon providing that and calling them the representative told me because i am mot a US citizen i cant get the credit card. I have a good credit history and lots of other companies have offered me credit total of almost 9000 $ not even one late payment. After waiting and wasting so much time they told me you are not eligible because you are not a citizen or permanent resident which makes me really upset. I hace been living here for 5 years which makes me a resident of state of texas. If that was the case why they dont have it in writing where they ask for country of citizenship while applying. Looking for your kind cooperation kindly help me. They also have a hard inquiry which will effect my credit score as they are denying."
166,"On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed on my XXXX credit report that I had a Wells Fargo credit card that was overdrawn for XXXX dollars that I did not do. I also did not open a Wells Fargo credit card. I went to the bank to confirm this and was told everything on the account was incorrect regarding my mailing address, phone number, email. I contacted the Wells Fargo fraud department and told them that I have no credit card and that it was fraud. From there I was told it was going to be looked into and contacted later but got no reply. Checking my XXXX  account in XXXX I noticed that Wells Fagro closed the account but in XX/XX/XXXX the Wells Fargo says I now owe XXXX dollars."
167,"Hello, I am reaching out in regards to a dispute I opened up with Wells Fargo. This dispute was for hotel stay at XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), I booked through XXXX for a trip to XXXX, I originally booked a stay at this hotel through XXXX to ensure that if I had any trouble they would be able to help me but it seems they are offering no help when it comes to disputing this charge even though I was assured that I would be able to get my refund by the hotel staff. The other members of the group I was traveling with also had the same issues and they were refunded for the stay. ( See Attachment ) Since XXXX was not helpful I disputed it with Wells Fargo. The reason for disputing this charge is because I did not stay at this hotel for the entire booking due to hotel conditions. The rooms were filthy, much smaller than advertised. XXXX units were not working properly and bugs everywhere. 

The Wells Fargo card is the XXXX which is a XXXX XXXX card. XXXX is also stating that they can not help me get a refund because I stayed at the hotel past 15 min but I had no other options. We arrived at around XXXX XXXX in a country that we are not familiar with so it would have been impossible to find anywhere else to stay. 

I have been disputing this charge since XXXX and still have not been helped. Wells Fargo constantly sends my dispute from team to team stating they can not help me, reject tej dispute or tell me to reach out to the merchant which is nearly impossible. 

I have attached photo 's of the room and proof that the group I was with received a refund from the same merchant for the same booking. 

Thanks!"

173,"On XX/XX/2019 I spoke with a bank teller with Wells Fargo about submitting payment for a late bill of {$140.00} I had on XX/XX/XXXX. When the XXXX came I went to pay the bill and saw that the credit was already there of {$140.00}. I thought that I had paid it already and forgot due to me paying a lot of bills that day and it not having a description of where the money came from. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called into the bank because I saw there was a late fee that occurred which made look further and it seems that they recharged me the bill of {$140.00}. Upon calling back in the representative told me that I gave the previous rep permission to charge the 3rd party card on my account that I had not used in months. I told her this was not true and she sent me to the executive office to file a complaint. I filed the complaint and asked both people I spoke with if I had to pay anything and how would this work with my cc still having charges due because of this mishap. Both said they wouldn't know until a resolution came about for the account. Three days after this conversation on the XXXX of XXXX I check my account and it is closed and no one has told me of this at all. I call the executive office and they tell me they can't do anything until they figure out what has happened. In XX/XX/XXXX my credit gets hit with late marks which prompts me to call the executive office of Wells Fargo because I'm not understanding how this works. The employee tells me that they will get the analyst to get back with me. I hear back from her on XX/XX/XXXX and she tells me that I authorized their employee to charge my 3rd party account and I quickly assured her that I hadn't used that account in a long time and would never say that due to it being an old idle account. She then says she will look into it and respond. In XXXX, my credit says that i am late again deeming another mark on my report, but I am still waiting on a response from the bank. On XX/XX/XXXX I reached back out due to my account gaining another mark and asked where the case was. The individuals told me they had no knowledge of a case, yet told me they would get an analyst to look into it. I called on XX/XX/XXXX to file a complaint because I am not hearing anything on the case and am told that there is a new case open which had no knowledge of and an analyst by the name of XXXX XXXX would be working on it now, but he was unavailable at the moment. Today, XXXX XXXX  reaches out to me and I ask about the case which prompts him to tell me that I did authorize the amount to come out of my actual debit card with WF which is not what the previous person said that dealt with the case. I told him I did not authorize that and that the previous analyst said it was a third-party account. He held his answer which led me to ask why there was no negative balance on my debit account if it had tried to take the money out. He told me that it doesn't happen this way yet I have known it does because I have had money come out of my checking to pay a credit card on another card I have. If there was a smaller balance than the amount taken out then it would show an overdraft charge on the debit card side and a fee on the credit card side which was not the case. XXXX told me I already know the verdict and that I am looking for "" help '' or "" resolutions '' that benefit me which won't happen. He had all of my information incorrect and told me that there's nothing he could do. I think it is terrible that a bank that you sign your name into doesn't have any good customer service. I know good and well that they are lying and covering their own selves which is unfair to the customer. I just graduated college and fell a little behind in the midst of trying to find a job in my career field yet this is how I am treated with a bank I have had since XXXX. He is basically telling me that I am a liar. In addition, on XX/XX/XXXX I received a credit of {$37.00} for a late fee on my credit card after I hadn't paid it. XXXX told me I have to pay the card regardless of a case and they should've told me this, which they did not. I was told to wait until the completion of the case which still has yet to be resolved. XXXX clearly does not know what is inside of my case because every date he told me was incorrect leading himself to change it every time."

186,"On XX/XX/2022, I applied for a Wells Fargo credit card online. I have cerebral palsy and as I was typing the information online I mistyped the phone number online after I summited the application. Wells Fargo pulled my credit report on XX/XX/2022. After that its been almost one month that I have not received correspondence from Wells Fargo, whether I was approved or denied. The bank advised me that they can not complete the application because I have a fraud alert on my report, which clearly states that they need to call the applicant to complete the information and to contact the phone number that is on the credit report. Now, Wells Fargo is making this very difficult for me, the reason the fraud alert can not be removed is because I've been a victim of identify theft and it strictly says on the fraud alert that to be considered for credit they must contact the consumer and Wells Fargo has failed to follow that statement on the credit report."
188,"This involves a charge to a Wells Fargo credit card ending in XXXX which actually expired XX/XX/XXXX. I asked that this credit card account be blocked to all transactions more than a year ago due to egregious repeated fraud that happened to my Wells Fargo checking account which was then completely closed. Wells Fargo did close the checking account and did return the monies that were taken using sight draft fraud which should have never been successful. 

I kept this credit card account in existence simply because I have been told it is better for credit rating purposes to not close credit cards. I also put a block on the account. This credit card has not been used by me for years. A charge of {$36.00} showed up on the account XX/XX/XXXX under the name XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX AZ. 

There was a domain hosting service with whom I authorized use of my credit card between XXXX and XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX I spoke with the domain hosting company and removed my card from billing on the account which was held in the name of another person and connected to several websites. I believe that this is the same domain hosting company that was hosting those websites. Either way, the charge represents fraud. Either I have never done business with this hosting company or the charge is the result of the hosting company charging a recurring fee or new fee on a card that is expired and was removed from being authorized for use on that account. 

I am lucky I actually noticed this bill and this surprise charge after returning from vacation. I have not used the card in years and only the paranoia of having dealt with Wells Fargo and "" surprises '' of the past makes me periodically check billing which should show nothing. I was not happy about what I saw. 

I called the Wells Fargo credit card XXXX number on XXXX and my call did not go to the credit card services, but instead was routed to the collections department. That is a red flag. I told the person on the phone that I would like information about how that charge could show up and what Wells Fargo knows about the company submitting the charge. The only information that I received from the Wells Fargo employee, was however, the information on the credit card billing notice, and the number and hours of the Wells Fargo "" fraud '' unit. I called XXXX. They put me on hold for a few minutes but did eventually pick up. 

I went through the same story with the person in the "" fraud '' unit. Now, why I put the word fraud in quotations is because the employees at Wells Fargo tell me that if I had done business with a company and had a block on my account, and removed my card from billing as I had, they would still process a recurring charge. And that is what they did. And then Wells Fargo would call that a "" dispute ''. Wells Fargo seems to have a very flexible idea of what kind of financial transactions fit outside the definition of fraud. 

As the employee noted, many internet hosting companies charge for services every two years. However, this company, assuming it is the same one had not charged for services since I removed my card from billing on the account more than 30 months ago. 

So I really have an issue with both this XXXX XXXX Services company and Wells Fargo together. I think I should be able to block recurring services where I have already asked to remove my card from an account to have access to my account. It is pretty amazing that Wells Fargo makes a game of pretending that they simply can't up front give a customer the option to block everything from coming through a card if the customer up front says, "" block transactions on the card ''. 

Now as I spoke to the next person in the chain of people, maybe this was "" XXXX '' she claimed that now the account would actually be completely blocked. I sure hope so. I also asked that no new cards be issued to this account that might be used by others at some old address and then told that by Wells Fargo that I have a "" dispute '' but not a "" fraud ''. I certainly hope so. But why do I have to ask twice to have a financial institution do what I think is basic fraud protection for an account that is meant to be blocked? You get the feeling that the bank is incentivized somehow to NOT protect against fraud. 

To Wells Fargo : 1. I'm not wasting any more time speaking to Wells Fargo. I don't want to know what they consider NOT to be fraud. That is famously skewed. Any communication about this credit card issue definitely needs to be in writing. 
2. Any charges that Wells Fargo assigns as "" late charges '' and "" fees '' on top of a fraudulent charge by the domain hosting company are fraud by Wells Fargo. 
3. I am not paying Wells Fargo for a domain hosting company charge levied to a credit card which they were told was not available for use on an account I to which I have had no access for more than two years. That may not seem like fraud to Wells Fargo, but it is. 
4. I don't want anything done to my credit card account that affects my credit, but I want to be sure that there is no transactions on this card unless I go into a bank in person and ask for the card to be allowed to be used for transactions again. 




The relationship of Wells Fargo to fraud in lending is problematic."
189,"Approval email from the Wells Fargo Autograph card said it would arrive in 5-7 business days. After 7 business days, I called and inquired about where the card is in the process. However, the customer service representative said it might take another 2-3 weeks, and the supervisor said it might take another 1-2 weeks. Then, they said they are backlogged for over a month for some customers. Then the supervisor said "" oh wow, it just changed to in process just now. '' When I called again, the customer representative said "" in process just means when you were approved. '' This is a huge lie from the supervisor to get me off their back by saying it's in process/moving forward when in reality there is NO movement. This is directly contradictory to the "" 5-7 business day '' email they sent, and they declined to expedite the card when asked multiple times. However, there is still no definitive date as to when I will get my new credit card as it has not even been made/shipped yet. A colleague of mine I recently found out took over 1 month to get his new credit card."
190,"Good day, On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a Wells Fargo credit card and requested a {$5000.00} balance transfer to pay my XXXX card. When I viewed my account on the Wells Fargo ( WF ) web site it showed deducted from my available credit, but never posted and was then added back to my credit line. I called WF on XX/XX/XXXX to ask about the status of the transfer, I was told it was cancelled and needed to be reprocessed and to go online and resubmit the transfer, which I did..On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed the initial {$5000.00} transfer AND the 2nd transfer for {$5300.00} were both processed on XX/XX/XXXX, resulting in the account going over limit. On XX/XX/XXXX I called WF and was told they couldnt recall the transfer and chase needed to send the funds back. When I reached out to XXXX, they stated they were unable to and that WF needed to submit a good faith request in order to send the funds back. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I called WF and advised what XXXX instructed and was told they dont do that and that I NEED TO HAVE XXXX  SEND THE FUNDS BACK!!! They did advise they are aware of an issue thats occurring with balances transfers, but apparently arent taking action to mitigate the issue and putting the responsibility on customers to figure out. At this point, I had to request a credit balance refund so I can directly pay WF. In the meantime, my credit score has taken a huge hit due to the over limit status of the account.to assist with fixing this matter, WF needs to issue credit for BOTH balance transfer fees for the inconvenience this has causedalso any over limit fees need to be waivedapparently WF has not learned from the recent enforcement action and $ XXXX fine. I shouldve known better than to open an account with them."
193,"Balance XXXX ; LAST Contact was today where I was informed of their offset after the fact. XX/XX/2023. 

XXXX XXXX is the business account ending in XXXX XXXX card business as I obtained a business credit card; used it paid for 4 years at users rates. I couldnt pay XXXX ruined our business. I called them and told them I could pay XXXX a month till it was paid off. They said XXXX I tried but I am Paying this from my w2 income I work 11 hours a day for. I couldnt pay ; I was told they would charge it off if I missed toe pYemwbts. I got calls from the bank I said I just cant pay and when I can I will. Two days ago with no notice the bank withheld the amount of the credit card from my business bank account. I called today was told that they cant reverse it. I explained that money in the account is the capital account of the other partner and I would have to pay it back to him. I was never advised that there was a right to offset with Wells Fargo or I wouldnt have obtained the card. I was told the only way to negotiate a payment amount less than the full amount was to be delinquent multiple months. I was set up to become delinquent thinking it would give me leverage but it was all so they could offset. I was told they could offset my personal accounts. They have taken the XXXX from the bank account with no prior notice ; no judgment etc."
195,Wells Fargo ; XXXX balance transfer was charged percentage of total transfered. Which part of the tranfer was added to Wells Fargo Credit Card & Percent Rate charged and changed. Period of XX/XX/XXXX thur XX/XX/XXXX.
198,The interest rate fluctuated which every time XXXX playing more then I expected and I really didnt have the knowledge but I felt something was wrong so I left that bank bc the was taking my my money by their interest rates
199,"This complaint is a consequence of my original one dated XXXX which has been already closed - # XXXX. There, I stated how we purchased furniture at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX  XXXX, XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. We were lured by the XXXX percent interest in XXXX  months financed by Well Fargo. After the furniture was delivered and we received our first statement showing no interest charged, I assumed no interests will be charged to our account until XXXX XXXX when I had the chance to check our balance and learned Wells Fargo has been charging interests on this purchase. I submitted my complaint to CFPB on XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo responded with all sorts of statements claiming they were not going to reverse the interests charged to our account. 
I responded saying that we assumed responsibility for not keeping the original receipt from the day of the purchase where no interest was shown. We took a loss! However, yesterday, XXXX XXXX, I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX, Manager at XXXX XXXX, saying we forgot to sign the original purchase contract agreement. That was weird that we get a phone call from the furniture store at this point. She sent the new "" fabricated document '' showing an APR of XXXX %. She wanted my husband, XXXX XXXX, to sign it ASAP. 
I was in a shock and disbelieved at how these XXXX companies - Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX have conspired to fabricate this contract agreement, making sure there was an interest rate of XXXX % on the purchase made in XX/XX/XXXX. The purchase was done! Almost at XXXX  months since all that was made and done. Why out of nowhere they were sending this "" new contract ''? Look at all documents attached here. Check how it was carefully drafted - receipts were printed on XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX tried to tell me that there was aXXXX % interest rate included in our original contract and also stated and we did not understand. That's not true. If so, where is the original invoice? Why are you needing our signature now? After XXXX  months? In complicity with Wells Fargo, notorious for falsifying documents, this woman called us XXXX  yesterday and sent these documents via email. 
Whose idea was it to have her contact us? After this purchase was done XXXX  months ago. Why is she doing this for Wells Fargo? What is the benefit? 
From the beginning this was a joint account. But XXXX was in a hurry wanting my husband to sign this fabricated document ASAP for their records. Check what she sent me in the attached documents."
200,"I have reached out to XXXX Card services multiple times to find out why my card was changed without notice. 

In XXXX I disputed a charge the rep said I must get a new replacement card. I received a blue card instead of a black card so I called to inquiry and was told no changes go my account however my card wouldnt let work at XXXX or anywhere I called about 4 times and was finally told my card was demoted to a regular card and my elite status was changed due to {$2000.00} wasnt charged as of 1XXXXXXXX. 

Now why would XXXX not tell me this when I disputed the charge? Why was I allowed the Elite privileges all of XXXX if there a issue or some rule then XXXX should face notified me this is not right and truly unfair practices to change my account after I filed a dispute? 

I filed a complaint XXXX and was told 10 Days expect a resolution as of XX/XX/XXXX NOTHING FROM XXXX CARD SERVICES CASE # XXXX I have called several times and the reps states the case manager assigned has no updated notes just Nothing! I advised I will file on CFPB and they dont seem to care"

204,"I made a purchase on my Wells Fargo credit card on on XX/XX/2022 for {$3200.00} to a merchant called XXXX XXXX design. I ordered tee shirts to be designed. They were supposed to be ready for pick up in 2 weeks, by XX/XX/2022. The merchant kept giving me the run around and by XX/XX/2022 the shirts were still not ready. I initiated a dispute with Wells Fargo on that date. I submitted my statement, correspondences with the merchant and pictures of the closed business. I was told that the merchant would be given 15 days to respond. The merchant did not respond. After the 15 days, I reached out to Wells Fargo again and was told that the merchant would be given another 30 days to respond. The merchant did not respond. I have made repeated calls to Wells Fargo bank to follow up on my dispute. It had now been 2 months, over 60 days since I have disputed the charge. I called today, XX/XX/2022 and spoke with a supervisor, XXXX. She said that Wells Fargo has been backed up and my formal claim had not ever been submitted. She said that would be done today and I my claim would start today. I am expected to wait another 30 days. That would mean this dispute would have taken 90 days to be resolved. That is unreasonable and unacceptable. I am requesting a permanent credit of the dispute charge to my credit card account."
205,"On XX/XX/2022 I called Wells Fargo to inform them that I had been overcharged {$1500.00} for services/merchandise I did not receive. The agent informed me that she would be submitting a dispute on my behalf and for me to email any documentation, in which I immediately did. No other information was given to me. On XX/XX/2022 I received a voice mail from Wells Fargo letting me know my claim had been denied. I immediately called back and informed them again that I had not received any service/merchandise for the charge of {$1500.00}. I was asked to submit more documentation in which I did as soon as possible. On XX/XX/2022 I received an email from Wells Fargo stating my claim had been denied however, I was unable to open the attached documents in the email. On XX/XX/2022 once again I called Wells Fargo and was told by an agent that they were still investigating my dispute. On XX/XX/2022 I received a call from Wells Fargo. The agent informed me that my claim had been denied again. I explained to him that I had not received services or merchandise and I was being charged and forced to pay for something I never received. He became loud, argumentative and would not let me speak. I asked him why was my claim denied. He stated because it was submitted as cancelled and not as services/merchandise not received. I informed him Wells Fargo agents submitted the claims on my behalf and I had no control over that. I asked him to resubmit the claim and he said no and refused while being rude and talking over me. It was clear that he had no interest in helping me, cared about what I had to say or cared about being charged such a large amount for nothing. Wells Fargo has since put the charge back on my card and is unwilling to work with me or assist me in any way. I am disputing this charge because I am being charged for something I never received. Whether it was cancelled or not I did not receive anything for this charge of {$1500.00}."

I was told after approval that my credit limit was {$6800.00} ; 3 times the cost of the improvement. The sales rep told me I had to call Wells Fargo to ask why the limit was so high. I was told that it was a store credit card to be used at any XXXX XXXX XXXX  On XX/XX/2022 I told Wells Fargo I wished to cancel the credit card. I also canceled the order with XXXX XXXX the same day. I was assured by Wells Fargo that my credit card was canceled. I know XXXX XXXX canceled the purchase because the down payment was refunded on my XXXX credit card. On XX/XX/2022 I received a new Wells Fargo store credit card. I never wanted a Wells Fargo credit card. I thought when I requested the credit card to be canceled, Wells Fargo would honor my request."
207,I tried obtaining a credit card from the bank Ive been with for years but I got denied. I was told I was unable to receive a credit card because I dont have credit history. Thats the whole point as to why I wanted a credit card. To build my credit. Its ridiculous my own bank Ive been with for years wouldnt allow me to obtain a credit card
208,"Hi, I applied for a Wells Fargo Platinum card requesting a {$16000.00} credit limit and {$11000.00} in balance transfers. After my application was submitted, Wells Fargo responded with an offer for the card with a {$7500.00} credit limit and smaller balance transfer amounts. I didn't want those terms, so I refused to activate the card. However, Wells Fargo still processed a balance transfer for a lesser amount that I did not request or want, charging me {$210.00}, and debited the card I had not activated. 

I called and spoke with multiple people, but no one could explain why a balance transfer for an amount I didn't request was made on a card I didn't activate. The company said I could request a refund after I re-transferred the balance back to my old card, incurring another nearly {$300.00} in transfer fees from the other card."
209,I had a Wells Fargo Secure Card account open up in XXXX I went through a Financial Hardship loss my job and miss two payments in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. It would help me immensely if I could have the two late payments removed thats affecting my credit report.
211,Wells Fargo opened an account without my authorization. They also put unnecessary holds on existing accounts and charged unnecessary fees.
216,"XX/XX/XXXX I checked out of XXXX XXXX early, i had paid for my entire stay but had not yet paid for the resort and parking fees. I paid {$51.00} for one day 's worth of fees. The front desk agent told me that her manager had agreed to waive the remaining fees as I would no longer be on the premises. I received a receipt for this amount from XXXX.

XX/XX/XXXX {$150.00} posted to my account. This is a charge for the additional resort and parking fees XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX. The person I talked to told me they couldn't help me and I had to call their accounting department when they were open Soon after I disputed the charge with Wells Fargo as I became frustrated trying to contact XXXX. It is very hard to get them on the phone.

XX/XX/XXXX After back and forth with myself and XXXX, Wells Fargo decided that they would not continue with my dispute as XXXX  says the charges are valid.

I emphasized to Wells Fargo that I should not be paying these charges as the receipt I received was for {$51.00}. I checked out of the hotel and am no longer liable for accrued charges."

219,"I've been trying for over a month to get the balance on my rewards card and Wells Fargo refuses to give this information. They also refuse to communicate via writing like I have requested. My email is listed in this complaint. 

Here are ALL the details on the card so you can properly find the infromatin. 

On the front of the card it has REWARD CARD on the left side. 
The number on the front of the card is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX It says it is a DEBIT There is a note that states FUNDS DO NOT EXPIRE It states GOOD THRU XX/XX/XXXX The name on the card is listed as REWARD CARD It states it is a VISA On the back of the card it has the following. 
Top left corner it has the number XXXX Top middle it says XXXX Top right it has XXXXXXXX XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX The middle of the card says NON-RELOADABLE The XXXX digit number on the card is XXXX Below the signature box it says Authorized signature | Not valid unless signed. 
It has the WELL FARGO logo on the bottom left of the cad. 
Also below the signature box it says For assistance in the U.S., please call XXXX and For assistance outside of the U.S., please call XXXX In the bottom left corner of the card below the Wells Fargo logo it says This card is issued by Wells Fargo Bank , N.A . pursuant to a license from XXXX XXXX XXXX FDIC coverage provided under terms governing your card. 

I have now provided all details about this card and will await your response. I will allow XXXX hours for you to respond. If no response is given in that time, I will assume that you are ignoring my message. I will then look to file new complaints with ALL the new information with the agencies so you can respond via those means. 

This should be all the information needed for the company to properly respond to this complain with the balance on this card where the funds do not expire. It's all the information that I have about the card."
221,"I have a credit card through Wells Fargo. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a text alert for suspicious activity. The activity being {$14.00} for XXXX XXXX, which thankfully was denied. I have not had XXXX XXXX in years, my credit card has never been attached to my XXXX, and physically I still had my card. I immediately reported my card as stolen. Got a new one. 

Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, under my brand new card that I had not activated, I received another alert for suspicious activity, again for {$14.00} XXXX XXXX, again declined. I called my bank this time. The lady over the phone said that my account was "" digitally transferred '' to the new card, so any merchants who had my old card were automatically updated with my new information. She did a hard transfer and issued me another new card. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I yet again, under the card that I had not received in the mail got another text alert for suspicious activity. Same XXXX XXXX and this time the charge was successful. I call my bank again and the guy tells me "" I don't know how this keeps happening. All we can do is continue issuing new cards. '' I contacted XXXX and they told me the transaction was for XXXX XXXX under the account of XXXX XXXX XXXX I do not know anyone by this name or close to this name, but XXXX refuses to remove my card from her account, flag her account, or anything. They just kept telling me to contact my bank. Which, as I have explained here, has gotten me no where. So my usable credit card remains on this strangers account and no one will do anything about it."
222,"Wells Fargo is failing to properly itemize my balance transfer ( s ) on my billing statement. 

If you review my account history, you will see that the entire amount of the balance on my card is in balance transfers. There is a {$2900.00} balance remaining. The statement reflects my balance transfer promotional rate will end XX/XX/XXXX,  and the remaining balance is $ XXXX.The problem is the remainder of the balance is not itemized on the statement. 

I spoke to two representatives onXX/XX/XXXX. The first representative advised me the remainder of the balance would expire XX/XX/XXXX. This promotional expiration date for the balance transfer as well as the balance is listed nowhere on the statement. I finally asked to be transferred to a supervisor because she didn't seem to understand my problem with the statement. The supervisor I spoke to was XXXX. He also didn't seem to have a clear understanding of the problem on the account. He stated someone from their executive team would contact me regarding the problem, but I advised XXXX that I planned on filing a complaint with the CFPB, because clearly the statement should accurately inform customers when his or her balance transfer is expiring in order to better prepare the customer for the interest that will begin to accrue. My recent statement is attached to this complaint."
224,"I performed a fully authorized charge to my client 's credit card ; it stood for almost XXXX months, until he disputed it, and now, his card company claims it is not their fault for returning the charge to him, when clearly, it is. Here is my explanation : I ran the authorized, {$1200.00} charge through my card processor, XXXX. XXXX months later, they said Wells Fargo had approved a chargeback for that amount to my client, XXXX XXXX. They also said they received all supporting items related to this more than a month ago. They sent all of that over to Wells Fargo. 

This was authorized by my XXXX, XXXX XXXX, both verbally and per his lease, for payment toward past-due rent of his office/personal home, per the lease he signed in XXXX of XXXX. ( He also gave me verbal authorization to make such charges, including a charge of {$720.00} in XXXX of this year, XXXX, and there was NO PROBLEM with this charge. ) This is the exact letter I sent to XXXX : This {$500.00} charge, and the other {$700.00} charge ( totalling {$1200.00} ), were authorized under the lease signed by XXXX XXXX, who is now behind approximately {$4000.00} in rent. He had previously authorized a payment of {$750.00}, XXXX months ago toward his rent, as you will see by my transaction records. This total of XXXX plus XXXX equals only XXXX of the XXXX months he owes : XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, XXXX. He also owes {$400.00} in late fees for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, plus {$300.00} more for his full XXXX payment, plus {$210.00} for his electric bill, which I was forced to pay for him while he was hospitalized.

226,"Late fees assessed erroneously. Full payment ( actually more than ) every 28 days ( 2 biweekly payments ) has been made consistently, yet I still am assessed fees. Late fees assessed due to changing window of when payments would be accepted. Late payments are assessed as a result of not removing previously discussed erroneous fees that were agreed to be removed through multiple phone discussions. 

This is a repeating issue. The issue requires constant babysitting of invoices from Wells Fargo and requiring a multitude of calls per year."
227,"XX/XX/XXXX I went to my local Wells Fargo office and wired {$18000.00} to buy a car. I covered the wire by transferring {$7000.00} from my business checking ... XXXX to my personal checking ... XXXX and I wrote a convenience check # XXXX for {$12000.00} to be deposited to my personal checking acct ... XXXX and charged against my personal credit card ... XXXX which had a {$13000.00} limit and a balance of {$110.00} leaving an available credit amount of {$12.00}, XXXX. There was a 4 % fee of {$480.00} which would have left an available credit balance of {$400.00}. The wire transfer occurred without incident, but the convenience check was never charged to my personal credit card ... XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX, the available credit is still {$12000.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX The convenience check was returned NSF, which I do not understand. My business checking account XXXX balance of {$7700.00} was taken to XXXX to cover the NSF . My business credit card ... XXXX was charged {$4200.00} and that amount transferred to my business checking to cover the remainder of the NSF convenience check. Plus other overdraft fees. 

All the above transactions were done in the bank with the full knowledge of the staff regarding the multiple steps that needed to happen. Everything went smoothly and the wire was sent. However, after discovering that my business account went to XXXX, I met with the bank rep on 2 occasions and had a couple of follow up phone calls with him. The problem was being "" escalated '' and assigned to a person whose job was to solve these problems. I was told it will resolve itself in 3 days, then 5 days. After 7 days I gave up. To this date, nothing has changed. I have not been contacted by the bank. Today is XX/XX/XXXX. Had my personal credit card ... XXXX been properly charged {$12000.00}, none of this would have happened."
228,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX customer support to understand why my in-app payments were not going through. I was then told my Wells Fargo XXXX account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX without any warning, resulting in a loss of over XXXX rewards points in my XXXX account and a severe drop to my credit score. When I called XXXX customer services on XX/XX/XXXX to learn more, none of the agents had any information about why my account had been closed. I was transferred 4 times before an agent told me that a letter would be arriving with more information and that is the most she could do. When the letter arrived on XX/XX/XXXX, it contained little-to-no information about why my account had been closed beyond 'suspicious payment or account activity, or money that we could not collect. ' So, I called the number in the letter for more information. After being transferred XXXX times once again, nobody was able to provide any information about why my account is closed, stating that 'there 's nothing in the notes about the closure. ' The last agent informed that the fraud department is handling my account and the she could email them to get in contact with me since they do not have phone to call. Two weeks later on XX/XX/XXXX, I had not received any calls so I called the number in the letter again. After having to explain my situation again, I was transferred to card services, who quickly ( and incorrectly ) transferred me to business card services, who then transferred me to another support line. The agent I spoke to was finally able to tell me that my account had been closed due to "" 6 returns in 6 months. '' I contested that all but one month 's payment had gone through, and that my account balances would reflect that. She escalated me to her supervisor, who explained the same thing to me. I asked for a contact with more information, and she transferred me to a customer advocacy representative who listened to my situation and escalated my account to by reviewed by the "" Executive Office. '' I am now waiting to hear back from that office about reinvestigating my account. I have been told by many agents that my account can not be reopened, and I have to submit disputes to the credit bureaus to hopefully recover my credit score. I did everything to pay this card on time and use appropriately in alignment with guidance XXXX and Wells Fargo, and have been unreasonably punished and robbed of benefits and credit."
230,Applied for Wells Fargo Visa Signature Card on XXXX XX/XX/2022. Approved. But since then the card is not being sent at all. Called today. The customer service lady who picked up the phone call was laughing for no reasons. Asked to be connected to Escalation team and then talked to XXXX XXXX. She said that card was sent out yesterday only. Why in the world it's almost 18 days and the card is not being sent even after approved application?
235,"I contacted Wells - Fargo several years back and told them I did not have a credit card with them and I file a complaint with the police in 2018 and Wells Fargo stated they were going to closed the fraudulent account that was in my name.

239,"On Wednesday XX/XX/2023 I made several phone calls to Wells Fargo to first understand why I couldn't make an online account. My husband and I recently purchased a furnace through XXXX XXXX in XXXX. XXXX XXXX used Wells Fargo as their finance option. We spent {$4700.00} and went with the 18 month interest free payment plan. Upon receiving my account number from Wells Fargo I tried to create an online account to begin auto payments. I was denied entry upon entering in my Social Security # and account number. I called Wells Fargo to ask for help. These are my calls, times and interactions below : XXXX XXXX Was led by a representative in enrolling my account and was again denied access. I was transferred to another representative that told me in order to enroll online I needed to go to a Wells Fargo branch to show my ID. I wasn't told why this was or given any help when I asked if there was another way I could make payments. 
XXXX XXXX  : After researching where the nearest branch was I realized that there are no branches in the state of Ohio where I live or any surrounding states. I called back and was told again I needed to go to a branch no matter how far it was from me. 
XXXX XXXX : I called again to ask if there was anyway I could make ANY types of payments on my account via phone, mail, etc. I was told the only way to pay was to travel 100s of miles to make a payment in person. I was given no help after this. I was left frustrated, hopeless, and scared because I need to make payments on this."
243,"my original loan amount was for about XXXX, that was a year ago. I called the bank today to see if I could have that 'accumulated ' amount reduced or eliminated. I was advised that it was not possible. This started out as a relatively small loan for an engagement ring for my fianc, and I was making regular payments for the life of the load up until now. I called on XXXX occasions and spoke to XXXX different representatives and I was advised that there were no options. I used to hold a regular credit card with Wells Fargo but I paid that off and closed the account because I do not care for their business practices. But for this particular purchase the vendor only used Wells Fargo for purchases of this kind. I would like to launch a formal complaint, in pursuit of a resolution regarding the XXXX interest charges. I am willing to pay off the original balance in full but I refuse to pay the interest on this this item as I believe is unethical and mounts to modern day usury. Please let me know if you have any further questions.

244,"In early XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo credit card dept to see what upcoming credit card promotions they were having. The first call I spoke with a guy who told me that I could renew my current 0 % interest promotion XX/XX/XXXX and that there was also another promotion- a balance transfer promotion that was also 0 % interest for 12 months and that I had to the end of the year to sign up for that promotion. He also told me that I could sign up for a rewards promotion that gives and an extra XXXX points if {$1000.00} is charged within 3 months. I called Wells Fargo a few more times to get information about the balance transfer promotion and how much the fee would be for different amounts. 
A couple weeks later ; approximately XX/XX/XXXX I called again after deciding to do the balance transfer for {$15.00}, XXXX. I spoke with a lady who informed me that I had received inaccurate information about the promotion that I did not have until the end of the year to use the promotion that I had to apply and be approved before the end of the year. The woman told me that if it didnt go through by the end of the year, I would not be able to take advantage of the promotion because it ended XX/XX/XXXX. The woman submitted the request telling me that it could take 10 to 14 days to get approved which would have put me past XX/XX/XXXX and I might not get the promotion. The woman submitted the request for the promotional offer and on XX/XX/XXXX {$15000.00} was transferred into my checking account. 
The woman did read a disclosure to me over the phone and I did ask several questions for which she provided me answers. Multiple times I explained that I was using the promotional offer to pay off another loan that had an interest fee. I was told that I may or may not get an additional 0 % interest promotion on the card that I made the balance transfer from when the current 0 % rate expired on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that I had until the end of the billing statement in XX/XX/XXXX to pay off any balances that were not related to the balance transfer to avoid any potential interest if the current promotion was not renewed. 
The woman told me that because the balance transfer happened in a new billing period that I would have to the end of that billing period which would be XX/XX/XXXX to clear any balances not related to the balance transfer to avoid interest charges if I wasnt eligible for another 0 % promotion on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I paid down the credit card balance $ XXXX that was the amount that was over the {$15000.00} balance transfer. That would have made the balance left on the card only the {$15000.00} balance transfer- which was at 0 % interest for 12 months. I even paid the {$450.00} balance transfer fee. 
I called Wells Fargo credit card dept again XX/XX/XXXX like I was instructed by the Wells Fargo representative to see if the credit card promotion on the card could be renewed and to get the rewards promotion set up. Sometime during this conversation it was disclosed that when I make payments that the payment would be divided between the balance transfer amount and any additional charges made not related to the balance transfer- BUT because they did renew the promotion on the card that it made no difference I would not be charged any interest because the 0 % promotional card rate was renewed and the balance transfer rate was 0 %. 
It was pretty confusing at times but I felt like my questions were answered correctly ; I had no way of knowing I was being given any inaccurate information by any of the Wells Fargo representatives. I did explain numerous times what I was trying to do and what I was expecting from them. 
At some point- after many calls it became apparent that I was not given accurate information and Wells Fargo basically said to bad- nothing we can do about it now It ended up that I had to apply for another credit card so that I had a credit limit available to me that was separate from the balance transfer. This was done because somewhere in the many confusing conversations it was disclosed that my payments were going to be divided between the balance transfer and any additional charges I made and any additional payment that I made would go only to the balance transfer which meant that I would never be able to pay off the monthly charges because all the additional payment would go to the balance transfer and I would not have any credit card balance available to use if I needed it. I spoke to several people complaining because I was told by several people that this wasnt going to be the case. 
Sooooo I opened another credit card it was put on the same 0 % interest for 12 months. I had to wait for the new card this involved another bazillion calls to Wells Fargo credit Card Dept. 
I paid the card balance down to {$0.00} accept the {$15000.00} balance transfer before the card billing period ended on XX/XX/XXXX and according to the Wells Fargo representatives all charges including the balance transfer were on 0 % interest promotions and I would have no interest charges until XX/XX/XXXX. 
I was worried that one of the auto payments I had set up on the account was going to charge before I could get the new credit card number so I called the card in stolen so no other charges could be charged on the card ; I use one card for monthly charges that I pay off and the other is suppose to be just the balance transfer. 
I called Wells Fargo several more times the week of XX/XX/XXXX asking why I could not see my credit card statement. During one of those calls a guy told me that there was {$1100.00} dollars on the card that was subjected to interest I complained numerous times and demanded a supervisor explained that the only charge on the card should be the balance transfer which was at 0 % interest AND the card itself was also on a 0 % interest promotion. The guy referenced the supervisor who stated that the information was not accurate because the cards billing statement was coming up- I had to wait a couple days call back and everything would be correct. I complained about not being able to see the statements because he could not explain why he thought there was {$1100.00} subjected to interest causing me to think there were fraudulent charges on the card I had paid off the balance accept for the {$15000.00} balance transfer and I am using the new card for my monthly charges therefore I didnt charge {$1100.00}. I complained- was transferred several times complained transferred. FOR THREE HOURS!! 
I spoke with IT several times including supervisorsthey insisted there was no way to retrieve the credit card statements online even though I argued that it had been done in the past. Again I was told by a supervisor to wait a couple days and the information would populate correctly. 
When I checked for my new statements again on XX/XX/XXXX I found a {$9.00} charge for interest. It shows that there is {$1100.00} subject to 10.65 % interest and my balance transfer balance is now at {$13000.00}. 
I called Wells Fargo Credit Card Dept AGAIN on XX/XX/XXXX again I was given no explanation as to why I was being charged interest on a 0 % interest promotion. I got transferred to a supervisor she transferred me a few more times and eventually I was transferred to the executive dept. 
Eventually I get to another supervisor XXXX XXXX tells me the reason that I was charged interest is because the payments I made from XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX were not allocated correctly. It was explained that there were not additional charges for {$1100.00} the interest came from Wells Fargo applying the payments that I made to get the balance down to zero before XX/XX/XXXX to the balance transfer instead and that caused there to be {$1100.00} subject to interest- even though the credit card was on a 0 % interest promotion. 
I explained that I had been told multiple times that the both the balance transfer and the credit card were on 0 % interest for 12 months I even explained all the BS of calling the card in stolen getting a new credit card to make sure the balance transfer was separate from my monthly credit card use Several people telling me there couldnt be any interest because everything was on a 0 % interest promotion. 
XXXX said the only way to fix the issue was to file a complaint and it would go to the next level to be corrected. 
XXXX gave me the complaint # XXXX and told me it could take up to 10 days to get a response I complained about that also telling her I got incorrect information supposedly. from several people and I have been dealing with it since the balance transfer in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX advised me that I didnt need to wait to hear from them that I could call in the morning. 
I called again XX/XX/XXXX spoke with XXXX she stated that she could not help with the issue and looked to see if it was reported. XXXX advised me that it was reported and that my case # is XXXX. XXXX told me that my case was assigned to a XXXX XXXX she puts me on hold to CALL him. Then comes back on the line and tells me HE SAID hes not available hes on another line with a customer. XXXX tells me he will call me back when he gets off the phone or I can call him and gives me his number ( XXXX ) XXXX. I waited to the end of the day XXXX did not get any call so I called Mr. XXXX back got his voicemail which says if you want to speak with someone right away call another number. I called that number and complained that I did not get a return call from Mr XXXX I was transferred to an annoyed Mr XXXX who informed me he was investigating my complaint and something about he would be off a few days this week. I complained I was tired of calling Wells Fargo to get the issue resolved and he eventually said that he would call me back with his investigation today XX/XX/XXXX. 
Mr XXXX stated that he only needed to review one phone call that was recorded on the day that the balance transfer was made. I advised him that there were NUMEROUS calls made and that he should listen to more than one call- I spoke with several people and I specifically asked him to listen to the calls on XX/XX/XXXX and after in addition to the call where the representative submitted for the balance transfer promotion ; he insisted he only needed to listen to the call he claims was made on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Mr XXXX called me back today XX/XX/XXXX. He states that he listened to ONE phone call and what he wanted to hear was that the representative verbally read a disclose about balance transfers. 
Mr XXXX states that although neither the teller or myself had no way of knowing that the balance transfer would transfer sooner than 10 days and that somehow that was the reason for the {$1100.00} subjected to interest??? 
I AGAIN reviewed with Mr XXXX some of the many conversation parts that took place during this transaction and he apologizes that there was so much mis-information and repeatedly states that the representative who gave me the incorrect information would have had no way of knowing?? 
My question to Mr XXXX how is the consumer supposed to know when inaccurate information is being told to them Mr XXXX did not answer that question- he repeated that the representative had no way of knowing some information and regardless the teller read some alleged disclosures and the fact that I asked questions AFTER the disclosure was read and the representative answered those questions this alleged disclosure dismisses any / all inaccurate information I was given. 
Mr XXXX advised me that as a courtesy he removed the {$9.00} interest charged to my account and that if I wanted to avoid any future interest that I could AGAIN pay that portion of the balance that is not the balance transfer down to XXXX. And then I would be 0 % interest???? 
I advised him that I had already done that once why should I have to do it again CLEARLY that didnt work the first time!! 
I asked to speak to his supervisor- he stated that she was not available- I had to ask multiple times for her name he eventually stated that her name is XXXX and refused to give me her last name or a phone number I could contact her at. Mr XXXX stated that HE would speak to her about the issue and let her know I requested to speak to her. 

The resolution I am seeking is that the account be again reviewed and all of the payments I made to get the non transfer portion of the account to a zero balance from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX be allocated to only that. None of that money was intended to be applied to the balance transfer ; I spoke extensively with Wells Fargo representatives about making those payments. 
I made {$3300.00} in payments ; this was done making numerous payments they took a portion of each of the payments and applied them to the balance transfer. The amount that went to the balance transfer was higher than the amount applied to the non- balance transfer portion ; this is what they claim created the {$1100.00} portion that is subjected to interest on a 0 % interest card. 
I suggested to Mr XXXX that he listen to all of the calls ; I specifically asked questions before AND after and was given information by a Wells Fargo representative who should know their rules consumers no way of knowing that their representative is giving inaccurate information. 
Id like to again point out that the credit card involved is and has been on a 0 % interest promotion since XX/XX/XXXX. Which is long before the balance transfer. 
Wells Fargo representatives deceived me and fraudulently applied payments I made to my account in a way that they claim somehow allows them to charge interest on two 0 % interest promotions."
245,Wells Fargo closed my XXXX XXXX card without reaching out to me first to see if I still needed the credit line. Had to find out from a credit bureau report vs. Wells Fargo reaching out to me. No wonder they are always in trouble with government agencies.
246,"I have been contacting Wells Fargo for at least 6 months about this problem. Someone else with my last name is using my address to get a credit card and is now applying for a loan. I asked Wells Fargo a dozen times to fix the address. I even found his real address online and told them. They said they can't fix the address. What???? Their best advice - their only advice- was to mark his envelopes "" return to sender. '' I did that - and now he's taking out a loan. Wells Fargo said - after XXXX hours straight on the phone by XXXX of us using different phones - that it could only be fixed by a branch. I went to XXXX branches. All of them said they couldn't help. I complained again. Wells Fargo wrote me and said : As far as we know he's not using your social security number. Then how come he's using my address to get a loan now? I warned Wells Fargo months ago that he was just slowly escalating into my credit. They found the time to reply with a XXXX page single spaced letter about how they couldn't fix the address. What??? Wells Fargo has to be the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX bank in the world."
252,"Wells Fargo will not tell me how much is left on a "" FUND DO NOT EXPIRE '' Rewards Card that I have. I have attempted to work this out with the company and have gotten no response. 

I request all correspondence be done in writing. This is for the protection of myself and the protection of the financial institution. It seems that everyone would want this to be done in writing and not over any sort of phone call where the parties could lie and everything be a "" he said, she said '' deal. 

I request CFPB to handle this information and require everything to be done in writing so we can ensure that the financial institution is in compliance. It seems that by not requiring this to be done in writing the CFPB is simply allowing the company to practice unethically. 

If the CFPB is not going to handle this and simple close out the case without resolving the issue, I will contact the inspector general to investigate and find out why the CFPB is not acting ethically on behalf of a taxpaying customer. I'll also look to contact the XXXX  and the attorney generals office if the CFPB reject to help a customer. Is Wells Fargo paying off the CFPB to silence them and not allow this to be done in writing. What is being hidden to not have everything be done in writing from both sides? It just makes things look more like a scam when this requirement is not met. 

Thanks"
253,"From XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX 25+ phone calls made 19+ representatives/supervisors 6 requests to have calls pulled 51 business days, 73 calendar days unresolved. Company is claiming that our account was at one point 30-60 days delinquent and has been FALSELY reported to the 3 credit bureaus. It was reported on XX/XX/XXXX that the XX/XX/XXXX payment was 30-60 days late. We have had calls pulled and transcripts reviewed documenting that the account was never 30 days delinquent. This information was provided to us in letter form, outlining what occurred on the calls but is still being prefaced with there is no bank error and it is still the account holders error. HERE ARE ALL OF THE EXACT PAYMENT DATES WHICH CAN BE VERIFIED THROUGH EVERY SINGLE PHONE CALL!!!!!! THE ACCOUNT WAS NEVER MORE THAN 16 DAYS LATE!!!! XX/XX/XXXX - Account was opened. XX/XX/XXXX - {$84.00} payment due - payment made XX/XX/XXXX with live representative XX/XX/XXXX - {$84.00} payment due - payment made XX/XX/XXXX with live representative XX/XX/XXXX - {$84.00} payment due - payment made XX/XX/XXXX along with the XXXX payment with a live representative XX/XX/XXXX - {$84.00} payment due - payment made XX/XX/XXXX through automated system in the amount of {$160.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$84.00} payment due - payment made on XX/XX/XXXX through automated system with XXXX payment XX/XX/XXXX - {$84.00} payment due - payment made XX/XX/XXXX with live representative XX/XX/XXXX - {$84.00} payment due - payment made XX/XX/XXXX through bank website XX/XX/XXXX - received notification that there was a change to our credit scores and found that it was reported our account was 30-60 days late. We contacted the customer service department to find out what happened. On this call, the representative acknowledged there was a system error that post dated our XX/XX/XXXX payment to XX/XX/XXXX causing the system to think the account was late. The representative removed the XX/XX/XXXX late fee, submitted a dispute on our behalf to have the credit report error fixed, and assisted us with getting the payment processed that was pending and making the next months payment for XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX - it was reported to the credit bureaus that XX/XX/XXXX was 30+ XX/XX/XXXX - we were told that the XX/XX/XXXX payment is what was 30+ days late because there was no payment showing on the XX/XX/XXXX statement. No calls were pulled per request even though the XX/XX/XXXX payment was made on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - we were told that the XX/XX/XXXX payment was 30+ days late. XX/XX/XXXX payment was made on XX/XX/XXXX On four different occasions, four separate representatives told us different dates that were late. We were told XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and then XX/XX/XXXX in that order. There are inconsistencies from what they are telling us, what was discussed on the phone calls, and what they reported to the credit reporting agencies. Additional documentation attached."
254,"Wells Fargo credit card services closed my account on XX/XX/XXXX, because of late payment on one of my other credit cards. I spoke to them on XX/XX/XXXX and they refused to give me my rewards that I earned through there credit card. It was about {$1200.00} dollars worth of rewards that they owe, and the person who I spoke too refused to give those rewards. They said the only way to get those rewards was to reopen that account. I spoke to someone in customer service about reopening my account and they said that the account is permanently shut down and would and be reopened and the rewards are therefore forfeited."
255,"i applied for a Wells Fargo credit card that advertised 0 % balance transfers. Upon approval i called to start the transfer and was informed that i need to wait until my card arrives to submit balance transfer. This was not made clear to me prior to applying as i was expecting to transfer immediately ( ive never done a balance transfer before ). Fine, I waited. My card still hasnt arrived even though they promised XXXX days. So I contacted Wells Fargo directly to inquire. The representative just kept saying sorry for the inconvenience and told me they are having issues printing cards and its not their fault. I disagree. If they can not fulfill their obligations it is misleading and deceptive consumer practice to offer and have customers sign up for things they can not use. If I need a physical card to complete a balance transfer and you are unable to send me a physical card then you are not fulfilling your contractual obligations. I was told the delay in making and sending cards has been XXXX weeks already. Which means if there is a known delay in producing and shipping cards WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED PRIOR to applying & updated along the way. Now i am unable to take advantage of the promotional balance transfer which was the entire reason I signed up for their credit card. I was manipulated into applying for their card, when I could have applied at XXXX other banks had i known a ) I needed the physical card first and b ) you couldnt send me a physical card. My requested balance transfer is only XXXX XXXX of my credit cards approved balance. I asked the supervisor how can we resolve this? She said i have to receive the XXXX & XXXX that come with the physical card. I asked, Cant you just send me the terms & conditions and we can complete this without the card? She said no. Wells Fargo deliberately deceived me into signing up for their card. If I apply to another company now for a 0 % transfer i will not only take a hit on my credit report, but it will be past my due date for XXXX XXXX and id have an additional late fee and interest charges applied. They literally hoodwinked me and falsely advertised a service they are not able to provide. The supervisor said shed submit a report but before I could even ask for a copy to be sent to me she said XXXX XXXX and HUNG UP on me! They were completely unwilling to work on a compromise and kept saying it wasnt their fault for failing to provide advertised services. If i had been adequately and fairly warned there was a delay in sending cards, I WOULDVE PICKED ANOTHER COMPANY, which they obviously know and are deliberately hiding this fact from all new customers and applicants. Honestly appalled by this level of customer disservice. 
Also to add : they advertised that I could add the card to my XXXX wallet before i received the physical card to use it. BUT when i tried to do that i got an error saying my physical card needs to be confirmed before i can add it to my wallet. More misleading advertising."
256,"Hello, My credit card ending in XXXX from Wells Fargo was stolen and used without my permission on XX/XX/2018. My card has a chip which majority of cards has it now. So therefore the card was in my possession on time of the fraud. I noticed the use of my card and I called right away and canceled the card and received a new ( transactions were reversed ). 
XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from WF stating that the card was present and therefore concluded I authorize the transaction of a total of {$990.00}. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a complaint through CFPB that was referred to me by the police department of XXXX XXXX, CA ( I also filed a police report ). 
XX/XX/XXXX, I faxed 15 pages of documents to the Claims Department including police report, Federal Trade Commission ( XXXX report ), XXXX fraud alert report, CFPB complaint report, OCC office of comptroller of the currency, a dispute letter, emails to numerous WF executives. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I received a response through CFPB from WF stating "" your claim was reopened for reconsideration on XX/XX/2018. Please note, most cases take from 30 to 45 days. '' I also received a letter with this information within the same week. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from WF with the date from XX/XX/XXXX stating that they concluded that there is no new information and the case has been closed and therefore I have to make the payments. 

First I did everything I could have done and everything WF has asked me to do. For the second time WF have not given me 30 to 45 business days to look into this case. From the look of these days roughly three working days it took on their end. I have called WF yesterday at least 6 times to talk to a supervisor and it was not transferred. 
I was treated very poorly and abused by customer service numerous of times accusing me of fraud. They stated such facts that is impossible to steal a chip credit card while still in my possession and therefore it is on me to come up with footage of these non existent stores ( these conversations are recorded and are noted on my account ) I make sure every customer service read up on these notes. Others say that the police should have looked in to theses stores, the police first told me that these transaction numbers do not correlate to actual stores and that their job is only to make the report ( I called them again about this ). 
From my internet research it has been proven that chips can be stolen, I seen on TV, I have talked to numerous civilians about this matter ( even the police ). I have been with WF since day one, 14 years ago. Then I think to myself as I write this before the sun is up XXXX, where does the loyalty, respect and protection do I have from my bank - WF? 

I am XXXX weeks XXXX and very emotional with tears at times over this case. I am not looking for sympathy but I am looking for justice from a consumer stand point. I am left with no light to walk on, I am asking WF one more time to look at these transactions as half of your staff is on my side and sympathize with me stating "" these transactions does not make sense ''. I feel that I was not given the appropriate time stated for this investigation. 

I would like for customer service claim department supervisor to call me and solve this matter. I would like to also speak with the executive department. I would like this case to be looked at and investigated properly not only for my case but for all cases that has been treated this way. I want to continue my relationship with WF but as of right now I am NOT even using the card anymore as I am scared to go through a process so poorly handled by the company. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX"

262,"I applied for a rent payment credit card through Bilt during the first week of XX/XX/2023. It is a card company that seems independent, but is actually completely supported by Wells Fargo, including customer support and payment portal.

During this month of opening the card, I already had to call its customer service line to resolve some issues that I have never encountered through other credit card companies.

1 ) Two days after opening my bilt account, my account was attacked by fraud, and I wasn't notified at all. I only found out when I was scrolling through recent payment. I had to contact Wells Fargo to get a new card.

2 ) Seems like Bilt uses a different payment system than Wells Fargo. I submitted payments ( twice ) through Bilt app, after I successfully linked my bank account on the app. Both transactions failed to go through, so I had to call again. The wells fargo agent told me that they didn't see a bank account linked on their portal. This is why I suspect that Bilt uses a completely different system than Wells Fargo, because their information is not at all connected, which causes a huge hassle for consumers like me. 

3 ) After I had to submit my payment through Wells Fargo ( which went through ), I found out that my account is closed, without any warnings or emails or notifications. And no opportunities to dispute. I tried to explain what was going on, but the agent kept repeating the same sentences that they can do nothing about this, while I clearly have done nothing wrong.

No idea how this closure of my account will impact my credit score, but below are some points that I want to summarize regarding to Bilt : - Constant typos on their website and app - They don't have their own customer line - everything is supported and referred to Wells fargo, which is super confusing - Disconnection between Bilt 's database and Wells Fargo database, which is risky- They have a lot of positive reviews on XXXX app store. I suspect that many of them were fake."
266,"In XXXX, I applied for a store credit Wells Fargo card and was approved for a {$12000.00} credit line. I paid every payment on time, but received a notice that my account would be closed in XXXX, which damaged my credit.

I reached out to Wells Fargo about the matter to only find out that weren't offering this line of credit any longer."

Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX, they re-added the fraudulent charges back onto my account, and they stated that it was because I had a similar claim previously on my account, when Ive had the unfortunate occurrence of getting my card stolen TWICE off of a busy construction site."

I discovered this transaction on XX/XX/XXXX, within 24 hours of the transaction. I immediately called Wells Fargo to report fraudulent activity on my credit card. After speaking with various employees, I was told that an authorized user on the account made the transaction and that they were unable to stop the pending transaction. 

I am the primary account holder on this credit card. I separated all of my finances from my ex husband three years ago when we divorced. I was assured multiple times by Wells Fargo at that time that my ex husband had been removed from all of my accounts and had absolutely no access to me or my money. 

When we divorced, our debt was equally divided on mutual understanding that we would each pay our respective debts. My ex husband has failed to pay all debts since that time which has left me no option other than to pay them as my name is associated with these debts and my credit is negatively affected by non payment. I have paid over {$15000.00} of debt that my ex husband was court ordered to pay since our divorce. Additionally, I single handedly paid off this credit card ( {$8500.00} ) in the past few months. Within a month of this being paid off, my ex husband took a cash advance from this line of credit, maxing it out. 

After multiple phone calls to Wells Fargo I was able to speak with several managers who reassured me I was entitled to this money and it would be returned to me. I spoke with a supervisor who ensured me that the funds had been recovered and returned to my account, including the {$400.00} fee for the transaction, and the interest ( 25 % ) on the cash advance. The account was closed, I had a remaining balance of {$1000.00} ( the balance on the card prior to the cash advance from purchases I made that month ) with the next payment due in XX/XX/XXXX 

About 5 days after I received this information I received a call from the executive office of the credit card division stating Wells Fargo has reversed the refund, charged me the fee for the cash advance, and back dated the interest charges to XX/XX/XXXX when the transaction originated. Wells Fargo claims they have no proof that I was told years ago that my ex husband was removed from my account and that it is impossible to remove an authorized user from a credit card ; that the account would have needed to be closed at that time. This information was never communicated to me at that time and I was assured by Wells Fargo bankers that my money and accounts were safe and free from access from my ex husband."
270,"On 3 different occasions during the past 8 months, I have mailed, faxed, and delivered in person documents showing me as Power Of Attorney for my XXXX XXXX XXXX mother so that I can have access to this credit card account. This account had fraudulent charges made to it late XXXX and they were promptly reported. Because I chose to wait until I got a full account of the transactions on this credit card before paying, Wells Fargo has sent negative indicators to Credit Bureaus which has resulted in her only other credit card through another issuer to be cancelled. This is the only way we have to taking care of her and providing her daily essentials. 

They have not been cooperative or communicative as far as confirming they have the documents or asking any questions they may have to resolve the issue. The bank segment of Wells Fargo had no issue adding me as POA. In fact they faxed all the documents over to the credit card division and received confirmation that they received back in XX/XX/XXXX. My mother has had a Wells Fargo checking account for over 50 years."
271,"Signed up for Wells Fargo Visa Card branded with XXXX in early XX/XX/2022 in response to advertisement ( see link below ) offering 3 free hotel nights for spending over {$4000.00} on the card in the first 3 months of card opening. Spent over {$6000.00} in the first two months the card was open, but was only credited with one free night. Six calls/online chat exchanges with Wells Fargo resulted in them denying me the promotion and saying I was ineligible. 

This is dishonest and possibly fraudulent. I would hope Wells Fargo had changed their business practices but apparently they haven't.

I am assured that my balance is clear and my credit report is clear as well. I checked my credit score and the late payment is still on my record ( as of XX/XX/XXXX )"
273,"My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, In the month of XXXX I found out that I had a late payment from Wells Fargo Bank on my XXXX XXXX XXXX There was a balance on it for {$2.00}, XXXX the balance was from XX/XX/XXXX. For some reason I have not been receiving any statements at my new address which is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ca XXXX. I was also sick with XXXX in and out of the hospitals. Once I found out that I have a late payment I went ahead and payed off my balance. Now It is reported in my credit with XXXX and all the other credit places as a late payment. I am trying to buy a new car and this is really effecting my credit score. If it's possible can the late payment please be removed. I have a great credit score, I have never been late on any of my credit card bills. For some reason I am not sure why I wasn't getting any statements from Wells Fargo. I do not have the card with me since it is a closed card but my social security number is XXXX birthday is XX/XX/XXXX"
275,"After thorough research, I determined that Wells Fargo Autograph Card is the best card that fits my need. So I applied for this card on XX/XX/XXXX. The application was declined quickly based the following reasons : 1 ) oldest account has not been opened long enough ; 2 ) not enough open revolving credit cards with high credit limit ; 3 ) amount owned on bank card is too high relative to the available credit limits ; 4 ) too little time passed since the most recent credit card was opened. I explained the reason and asked for a reconsideration of just issuing a credit card with {$500.00} limit to start the relationship. It was declined again.

I explained that 1 ) my oldest credit card was opened in XX/XX/XXXX and it's been in good standing for 2 years ; 2 ), I have three credit cards open right now, with one credit card limit of {$10000.00}, and the other two are {$5000.00} and {$1000.00} ; 3 ), I only have 1 out of 3 credit cards carrying a balance of {$2500.00} which was paid down today ; The other two cards have no balance ; 4 ), my most recent credit card was opened half a year ago, I was planing to stop using that card once I get this card.

I believe the above reason are substantial enough the meet Wells Fargo unreasonably high standard. 

Application reference number : XXXX"
276,"I have just found out, after realizing that I have been paying interest on my credit card purchases for 2 years, that Wells Fargo has changed my credit card from a student card to their charge card in XX/XX/2020. The new card was sent to me around the expiration date of my previous card making it seem that the replacement was just for that reason. When calling to activate the card, I was not informed of the change, and the call proceeded as any replacement card activation. When I called today to resolve the issue, the banker on the line informed me that the bank has rather discontinued their student credit card at that time, and instead has just switched me into their charge card, and that given that they have sent me a letter with this information and that since I have activated my new card I have provided the bank the approval to the switch. Two years after the switch, I was actually informed of it, which if anything is a form of fraud. 
This was not my first encounter with the fraudulent banking system of Wells Fargo, but similarly, I was never informed with my right to opt out of overdraft fees when signing up for my checking account with them, but rather, the banker made overdraft fees sound as a part of the contract that I had to sign on. Even when I previously complained in person and over the phone about their multiple overdraft fees, I was never informed of my right to just opt out. I have recently closed my checking account with the bank when a banker with XXXX explained this to me as I was inquiring about opening a checking account with them."
281,"Between XX/XX/2022 and XX/XX/2022, my card was charged {$1000.00} as a result of various purchases made via fraud. I promptly reported the fraud claim to Wells Fargo and the charges were temporarily reversed. I received a letter in the mail a few weeks later saying that my fraud claim was denied since I told the bank that the card was in my possession at the time when the fraudulent charges were made despite telling Wells Fargo that I did not make those charges. The extent of their investigation was that they determined that since the card was in my possession at the time of the fraudulent charges, I would be responsible for the charges. I've call customer service and the fraud claim department and they said that I would need to do my own investigation and provide receipts that I did not make those charges."
282,"On XX/XX/XXXX I did apply for a Cash Wise credit card from Wells Fargo. I am already a customer of Wells Fargo, so I applied after logging in to my account. The application was instantaneously approved, I received an email about teh approval on XX/XX/XXXX. My online account reflected that this was opened. I was also seeing on my credit report that a hard inquiry was made about my credit, which made my score drop from XXXX to XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed when checking my account, that the new account was showing that it was closed. I contacted Wells Fargo thru the website, but was told, they would not answer online. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called them. ( I am currently travelling so this was an interantional call and I made the agents aware of that ). All together I was transfered to 5 different agents and had to give them all my details again after each transfer. It was annoying and expensive. 

Finally XXXX XXXX XXXX from the Credit Executive Office told me, that her office and the fraud division had decided that my application was fraudulent. I asked, why they would not inform me about this? I did n't get an answer. I also told her, that I want to file a complaint with the regulatory body in charge and asked her, whom I would have to contact. She said, her office was the highest authority and there was no address she could give me. I also wanted a written appology and explanation, why my account was closed. She denied that. 

She promissed me that they had initiated procedures to eliminate the hard requiry from my records at the credit agencies, but this would take time. I would not get confirmation by Wells Fargo about the successful removal, but would have to check that myself."
283,I was suddenly starting to see {$10.00} charges as of XX/XX//2017 without any notice from Wells Fargo credit cards when I purchase from XXXX. I don't have a problem being charged fees but I do have a problem when I am not notified and can not change my consumer behavior. I would not have made a {$18.00} purchase if I knew it would generate a {$10.00} fee.
284,"I was sent an unsolicited Wells Fargo XXXX credit card in XX/XX/2022. I have never had a bank account, loan or credit card with Wells Fargo. I most certainly didnt apply for any credit card or their new product XXXX XXXX 

When I called Wells Fargo to inquire they wouldnt help me unless I provided extensive personal information. They basically called me a liar when I said I never applied for and didnt want a XXXX credit card. I called numerous times and each time the customer service reps were rude and aggressive. 

I also tried to report it to Wells Fargo fraud department but they said it wasnt fraud. 

Some years ago I did inherit a portion of my Dads IRA which I transferred to my own account within 30 days. So I assume they had all my personal information and opened the card using that information. 

On XX/XX/2022 I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating unusual activity and that my account had been placed on hold. The credit card bill showed previous balance, purchases and new balance all at XXXX ( zero ). The interest rate was 25.74 %. 

On XX/XX/2022 I received a notice that my credit card account had been closed. 

My biggest concern is that Wells Fargo used my personal information and ( excellent ) credit score to fraudulently open an account in my name."
286,"Consumers beware! If you are a Wells Fargo customer and you notice fraudulent transactions on your chipped credit card, report it as "" stolen ''. My card was in possession, it never leaves my house and is only used for utility payments, but somehow there were multiple unauthorized transactions on my card. I've contacted Wells Fargo many times about this and they insist that those transactions were in fact authorized by me simply because the card is in my possession. The unauthorized transactions total over {$1500.00}, effectively eliminating my government stimulus. I am very disappointed in Wells Fargo and its fraud department being that I've been a customer of it since I was a teen. I've read about many scandals involving Wells Fargo, and I highly suspect a Wells Fargo employee to be the culprit. I urge all consumers, if you haven't already, to switch to a different bank."
289,"Wells Fargo Credit Card was fraudulent with wire 2 wire transfers totaling {$8300.00} and after speaking with Wells Fargo XXXX dept. more times than I can count, over two months period, they did reimburse half of it and then just a couple days ago... again after many frustrating communications where we informed them we were going to sue, they released the other half into our account. BUT before we ever received the first half amount, Wells Fargo shamed us into paying the card off, which I did. However, after numerous calls still waiting to be reimbursed for all the FEES that they charged on the card that we no longer have. 
We are in our mid XXXX 's and because of all this we almost lost our car and home due to Wells Fargo lack of professionalism. As soon as we have been reimbursed for the unnecessary CC fees, we are closing our account. We truly hope Wells Fargo will do the right thing and allow us a settlement for our pain and suffering. 

This all started back in XXXX through this XXXX. 

Thank you, XXXX XXXX"
292,I have been battling this unverified and inaccurate account for awhile now and this haven't been proven whatsoever. The information across the reporting bureaus are different from each other implying that this account have different values and information.
293,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I was approved financing by Wells Fargo. That same day I walked into a the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and I purchased a XXXX and foundation. The store employee named XXXX XXXX told me ALL foundations will fit standard bed frames. I NEVER asked to purchase a XXXX XXXX XXXX. He selected that foundation WITHOUT my approval. Please also note, XXXX XXXX repeatedly asked me to purchase a more expensive foundation. I declined. 

According to the sales policy of XXXXXXXX XXXX are not returnable. Their policy does not say NO EXCHANGES. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX delivered the mattress and foundation. The foundation was too big for my bed frame. I contacted XXXX and they rejected my request for an exchange. 

The CFPB should protect consumer from "" bait and switch '' sales tactics. My dispute was initiated with Wells Fargo and most recently they rejected my dispute. I have decided to file a lawsuit against both companies. I do not understand why both companies will not satisfy a simple request of giving the consumer what he wants. 

Please investigate both Wells Fargo and XXXX. They are both complicit in using unsavory sales tactics and enticing consumers like me. 

Wells Fargo has a poor history in consumer finance. XXXX has return policies that are poorly written with a standard practice of REJECTING consumer requests. 

I am probably not alone."
294,Id had Wells Fargo for over 5yrs and when I asked for a credit limit increase I was told I had to back with Wells Fargo before I could get a credit limit increase so I cancelled the CC with Wells Fargo I dont like them at all
295,Wells Fargo promised the ability to extend a 0 % introductory interest rate with ontime payments. A payment in XX/XX/22 was mis-posted by them. They agreed that it was an mis-posting and waived the late charge. They have agreed thee ( 3 ) times to extend the interest free period but seemingly refuse to do so.
298,I was charged for a purchase I never received. Bank card was closed for undisclosed reason
300,"I have been dealing with an ongoing issue with Wells Fargo card for two (2) years. I called customer service again today and spoke with XXXX who advised that I had to contact the merchant to continue the process. I shared that I did not get the service nor amenities that were promised. The resort was extremely dirty and bug infested, my daughter suffered an awful bug bite and had to receive medical treatment. The resort did not have the number of resturants as advertised on their website. Wells Fargo has failed to properly investigate my claims."
301,"I had XXXX XXXX XXXX on my Wells Fargo credit card, XXXX XXXX upfront fee and XXXX no interest charges. During that time I accidentally overdrawn my checking account and the overdraft protection covered it. Called customer service and paid off overdraft amount and interest charge for XXXX months on overdraft. 
However, Wells Fargo applied my payment to XXXX of the XXXX XXXX and the overdraft remained at XXXX XXXX interest charge. That was in XXXX of XXXX, and there have been at least XXXX different people involved with my case at Wells Fargo 's `` XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' in South Dakota XXXX XXXX different officers filed complaints on my behalf at my local Wells Fargo Office XXXX 
Twice interest charges several XXXX dollars were reversed, but the problem not fixed and the interest charges continued. 
At XXXX point I received a letter stating that the "" Overdraft '' amount was transferred to "" Purchases '' with XXXX XXXX interest expiring XX/XX/XXXX, which was the correct date for the XXXX XXXX into which my overdraft payment was placed. I found this solution strange, but I assumed that for whatever reason this was the easiest way for the bank to fix the problem and what mattered was the XXXX XXXX interest. 
However, on my next statement the "" Purchase '' amount was collecting XXXX XXXX interest. Due to health issues and other personal complications ( I am XXXX XXXX years old ) I didn't immediately take up the fight - calling Wells Fargo was a time consuming stressful and frustrating exercise. Dealing always with a different person at the Complaints Management Office who didn't return calls, sent computer generated e-mails and always informed me that they will contacting me eventually. 
In XXXX I started another complaint through my local branch but there was no resolution before the Promotional Advance became due, so I made another call in which I called Wells Fargo 's actions "" criminally incompetent '' and that brought a XXXX XXXX from the Arizona "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' on line who was very sympathetic at first and was going to transfer my call to a "" Finance Group '' that was supposed to be able to fix the problem. 
When he came back on the line, he informed me that the "" Finance Group '' was not available and Wells Fargo has a policy of applying payment to the outstanding balance with the lowest interest rate, in my case that was the Promotional Advance with no interest, just the upfront fee which I had already paid. He also advised me to pay the amount that was due on the XXXX of XXXX but not the amount under "" Purchases '', which actually should have been in the XXXX XXXX and not collecting any interest. He also told me to await the outcome of the latest complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Finally I received XXXX letters from XXXX different people at that office which are simply non-sensical and completely misstate the facts.They informed me that my problem has been resolved and no more interest adjustments will be made. At this point I have been charged again almost XXXX XXXX dollars. 
Concerned that I will not be able to get justice and relief, I have decided to pay off the amount under "" Purchases '' and just forget the whole thing. Called Customer Service wanting to make sure that I am paying the right amount to the right place and this time I was informed by that agent that I can not decide where my payment goes, that's the bank 's decision, and if I want to avoid the XXXX XXXX  +- interest rate charges I had to pay off both Promotional Advances - the one that was due in XXXX and also the one that will be due in XXXX of XXXX. And, of course the XXXX XXXX upfront fee was already paid on that one also. 
This is a complicated and convoluted case but I have all the e-mails, letters and of course the monthly statements, as well as the dates and names of some of the XXXX XXXX people not with the South Dakota XXXX with whom I talked. The XXXX XXXX makes the situation much easier to understand and it does underline the fact that this could have and should have been resolved in XXXX minutes in XXXX of XXXX Several issues I'd like to point out : most important is the fact that the bank had a contract with me about the XXXX XXXX  that should have absolutely no connection to the overdraft protection. 
I can not recall any place where this convoluted relationship between the XXXX XXXX and overdraft protection was explained and/or brought to my attention in such a way that it was clearly understandable. 
Furthermore, it is obvious that their own Customer Service people have no idea of this convoluted relationship between overdraft protection and XXXX Balances. 
They twice reversed interest charges, sent me the letter promising the resolution with the XXXX XXXX  interest and no one until XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX told me that the bank has this policy of depriving me of my right to decide how and when I pay off my debt, so they can charge these exorbitant fees between XXXX and XXXX XXXX 

If this practice is indeed legal, it is most certainly unethical, immoral and should be illegal. Regardless, Wells Fargo 's handling this situation for more than XXXX months is so negligent and incompetent that is hard to believe that they care about anything but profits. What happens to the customer is completely irrelevant. 
Finally, I would like to ask for a resolution since I need to know if I indeed am required to pay off the Promotional Advance- not due until XX/XX/XXXX - in order to avoid further interest charges. Also, I would like the interest charges since XXXX reversed. 
Thank you for your consideration, and hopefully quick resolution of this matter, with Best Regards, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ca. XXXX XXXX"
304,"On XX/XX/2022, I opened an account with Wells Fargo for a Credit Card that included a promotional purchase period and promotional balance tranfser offer. On the same date, I was approved for a a balance transfer of {$6000.00} to XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/2022, I had still not received my credit card or had a balance transfer completed and called Wells Fargo support. Tier 1 support did not understand the issue, so I was escalated to tier 2 for better suport. Teir 2 support informed me that my balance transfer funds of {$6000.00} had been released to XXXX XXXX and would post by XX/XX/2022. Tier XXXX support also informed me that my credit card had shipped and would arrive shortly and that any promotional offers would be extended accordingly. On XX/XX/2022, I received a letter from Wells Fargo that my "" balance transfer for {$6000.00} to XXXX  XXXX was not completed because... have not received your new account credit card ....

Upon account opening, I was informed that my card would be received within 7-10 business days and my balance transfer would be completed within 2 weeks. Both of these timelines have been blown out of the water. Furthermore, upon speaking to the executive support team on XX/XX/2022, I was informed that the promotional offers WOULD NOT be extended even though I was unable to leverage the promotional offers due to delays caused by Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo support have been unproffessional and downright uneducated on the terms and conditions of the opened accounts. At this point, I wish I had never opened an account with Wells Fargo."

I went to my bank Wells Fargo to dispute the charge and accidentally input my dispute in wrong my intentions was to put in that I returned the merchandise but I put in that I didn't receive it a total mistake of hitting the wrong button. My bank did the dispute based on the error I made and refunded me the {$240.00} and then reversed it several months later stating that they received info from the merchant that I received it. I didn't find out until months later that I entered my dispute incorrect once I was informed of this I asked my bank to redo the dispute correctly so I can receive my refund because I did return the item back to the seller and I did use my card as they can see on my statement to make the purchase of {$240.00}. My bank said they can not reopen my claim and I should take it up with the seller who has not been compliant with me at all. I am disputing the bank decision because I made a mistake in filing my dispute but this is a legitimate dispute and I did spend the money of {$240.00} on my card and I did return that merchandise so I am entitled to receive my refund back from my card issuer which is my bank Wells Fargo. I am human and make mistakes like anyone else my bank has made plenty of mistakes on my account and I was considerate and understanding we all make mistake in life no one is perfect but in this case I did spend my money and returned the merchandise and have proof so I want my money back. The bank is refusing to open my claim and refund my {$240.00}.

312,"Wells Fargo N.A. has trapped my balances and per their allocation rules will not apply payments to pay off my balance transfers despite making payments well above the minimum payments. Wells Fargo allocates payments across all balance transfers first across those balances with the highest interest rate per federal guidelines. However, when all balances are of equal APR, payments are allocated to balances equally rather than allocating to the expiring balance. This traps my balances until I pay off all the balance transfer amounts, and I end up paying interest every day for balances I have already paid balance transfer fees on. I have contacted Wells Fargo about my concern with their payment allocation rules, and they have agreed to refund some of the interest accrued. However, they will not waive the ongoing interest I will accrue until I pay off the balance. I understand that this payment allocation is per their terms and conditions. However, it is not in the spirit of our agreement. The point of the balance transfer is to pay upfront fees to avoid accruing steeper interest rates and reduce debt. By trapping my balances, Wells Fargo has violated the trust I put in them to aid me in paying down significant credit card debt. I think this is a predatory practice, and Wells Fargo should adopt a different payment allocation practice for balance transfers. Wells Fargo should look out for its customers and in the situation of multiple balances with the same APR, they should allocate payments to the balance expiring the soonest. Otherwise, consumers risk trapping their balances and facing higher interest rates."
318,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a business checking account at a Wells Fargo branch in XXXX, XXXX Today, XXXX XXXX, I received an email ( which I will upload ) letting me know that my "" requested '' overdraft protection had been added to the account and that funds for the overdraft protection would come from a new credit card with number XXXX. 

Trouble is, I NEVER REQUESTED OR APPLIED FOR EITHER OVERDRAFT PROTECTION OR A CREDIT CARD. The paperwork for the opening of the checking account refers to neither, and I discussed neither with the representative I dealt with at the bank branch. 

Astoundingly, this sounds like exactly what Wells Fargo got in trouble for last year or the year before. It doesn't leave me with much confidence in the bank. 

I phoned the customer advocacy office at Wells Fargo to ask how this happened. They had no answers but did confirm that the credit card account had been opened. ( Of course, I have not seen a credit card and do not wish to see one. ). They said they would open a case on the matter and get back to me at some point."
319,"Wells Fargo robbed me. On Thursday XX/XX/2021 I was not able to make a credit card payment from the drive-through so I went inside breathing during a pandemic and waited. I had tried to pay earlier on drive through and could not. So finally I was given my total of {$65.00} owed and paid my bill in full with cash. The Wells Fargo representative gave me a receipt immediately. There was nothing printed on the receipt about holding the cash payment. The Wells Fargo agent did not say anything about the automatic payment being charged. When I checked my account online later that day it said that I owed nothing and the {$65.00} was credit pending. 
When I called on XX/XX/XXXX, I talked with XXXX who transferred me to XXXX. I reported to her that I saw online that the credit was still pending and that WF had removed XXXX from bank account. XXXX said that I had autopay and I said that was to pay debts owed, not debts imagined. XXXX said that it could take up to 5 business day for a payment to post. I asked why WF presented a receipt for cash as received but held the payment in hidden accounts. I asked why WF was defrauding me by telling me how much the bill was, taking the payment, not posting it, then stealing money from my bank account. XXXX then said that I had mentioned fraud so she had to transfer me to someone else in fraud. 
XXXX took my fraud complaint, saying she was noting all the details. I said that I wanted the fraudulent transaction from my bank stopped or my stolen money refunded to my bank account. XXXX said she was noting it and someone would get back to me. 
Wells Fargo continues to hold my stolen money. Wells Fargo must return the stolen money and pay any bank fees associated with this fraudulent bank draw. 
I locked the card so it could not be used, resolving to end this abusive relationship with WF. Nevertheless WF allowed a recurring charge past the lock. I disputed that charge as WF is a criminal company using my name in their criminal conspiracy to juggle money in secret accounts. WF can not transact any business on my behalf because of its commitment to theft and fraud. I told XXXX that. WF misrepresented my balance to credit agencies in accepting the charge and in stealing the money. WF also violated FDCPA in robbing money from my bank account when I had no debt, violating any autopay agreement we may have had."

Until you are more than welcome to call me and discuss with me if you are confused. *previous communication is attached below. on XX/XX/XXXX i called wells Fargo reporting a purchase issue with XXXX for {$3800.00}. Where I paid an extra {$40.00} to XXXX for a secured delivery to me and the parcel to be only released to me but anybody else i did that because of the amount of the purchase and i wanted to be secured from my end. On the XXXX of XXXX, i was at home waiting for my parcel to arrive, XXXX never showed up and i received an email from XXXX saying that the parcel was delivered to the address i freaked out and checked the tracking, It said it was delivered NO SIGNATURE WAS OBTAINED AND SOME RANDOM DELIVERY NAME AS XXXX was mentioned, For secured delivery XXXX is required to check the ID of the person before they release it. I freaked out so much as it is my life 's very first investment i called wells Fargo and reached out to XXXX  and XXXX XXXX XXXX said that the sender could file a claim with us as a receiver i could not do anything.

XXXX did not deliver what they promised. Please help me Please. according to visa terms and conditions, on the denial letter earlier it says, Merchant has provided the proof of delivery? the proof of delivery can not be deemed sustained because the delivery person is different including the signature obtained does not belong to me.

321,"On XX/XX/2023 I applied and was approved for a Wells Fargo XXXX credit card. Per their website it is advertised as "" 0 % intro APR for 18 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers. Intro APR extension for 3 months with on-time minimum payments during the introductory period. '' For a total of 21 months 0 % APR. I had opened this card specifically to utilize the intro APR for a balance transfer. Wells Fargo however, doesn't allow you to do balance transfers until you actually received AND activated the card. I called to see if they could start the transfer over the phone but 2 levels of customer service managers told me that I had to wait until I actually received the card in the mail. This would take 7-10 business days. Further, they informed me that balance transfers take 4 days to process and have an automatic hold placed on them for an additional 10 days int heir system. So assuming I get the card in the mail in a timely fashion and am able to activate it right away we're still looking at nearly a whole month of loopholes to not have them honor the intro APR! Other credit cards allow balance transfers to begin as soon as the application is approved online ( did it with XXXX XXXX a few months ago ). This is unacceptable... at best it is false advertising and at worst it is straight up fraud. Which considering all the fees levied against Wells Fargo in years past for shady practices you'd think they would have learned their lesson ... but nope... still screwing over consumers!"
324,"On XX/XX/2022 Wells Fargo made a {$11000.00} payment to XXXXXXXX XXXX  to transfer the balance. Wells Fargo then again on XX/XX/2022 mistakenly and without my authorization or request made a second payment of {$10000.00}. This caused an overage of payment and a credit balance with XXXX, but also created a situation where I am now {$10000.00} over my "" credit limit ''. Wells Fargo is charging me two transfer fees and over-the-limit fees. This was 100 % their mistake. I called after my card was declined and Wells Fargo said I have to work out the refund with XXXX! I was told I had to call XXXX  and request a refund and then pay them back. The credit card company who made the payment should be able to work directly with the credit card company who received the over-payment. I as the consumer should not be harmed by this mistake either with fees, penalties or poor credit reporting. I have no control over what CC companies pays another and yet the solution had landed squarely in my lap to "" fix '' this mess."
325,"I HAVE HAD WELLS FARGO SECURED CREDIT CARD SINCE XXXX. I MADE ALL PAYMENTS ON TIME FOR YEARS, UNTIL XXXX OF XXXX. I END UP MAKING 1 LATE PAYMENT, REASON BEING, ILLNESS TO XXXX, WHICH CAUSED ME TO BE OUT OF THE WORK FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. I CALLED A FEW TIMES TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER ABOUT THIS. THEY PRETTY MUCH DID NOT CARE. YOU WOULD THINK BEING A LOYAL CARD HOLDER FOR 5 YEARS WITH ONLY 1 LATE PAYMENT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP ME. THIS IS MAKING IT HARD FOR ME TO START BUILDING MY HOME. THE UNDER WRITERS ARE TOUGH. IF I WOULD OF NOT GOTTEN SICK. I WOULD OF NEVER GOTTEN THE LATE FEE. I THOUGHT CREDIT CARD COMPANIES TRY AND WORK WITH CONSUMERS THROUGH TOUGH TIMES. I HOPE THEY CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS IS CAUSING. I AM PERSON WHO LIKE TO PAY THERE BILLS ON TIME AND COMMUNICATE WHEN I AM HAVING AN ISSUE WITH PAYING ANY BILLS."
326,"I am reporting big fraudulent charges on the fraudulent Wells Fargo credit card account with my name, the card ending in XXXX. I have been living in central Illinois near 18 years now. Unfortunately, recently my identities were stolen by a thief in Florida. I received a Wells Fargo bill statement of credit card ending XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2022. I never apply for or have this credit card account. The statement shows big fraudulent charges of a total {$5900.00} including major transactions in Florida. I called Wells Fargo right away to report this fraud problem. But yesterday I received an attached letter from Wells Fargo which denies my fraud claim. I had to call Wells Fargo again to ask detail checking and investigation about my claim. I spent over XXXX hour to spoke to XXXX different representatives but no good answer so far. I had reported to our local police department to file a police report # XXXX, with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ID # XXXX. The contact phone # XXXX, XXXX XXXX Police Department, Illinois.

332,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased an excursion for Alaska  through XXXX/XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$450.00}. The transaction shows a date of XX/XX/XXXX. 

I bought insurance for the excursion from XXXX XXXX for {$26.00} on the same date ( XX/XX/XXXX ). The transaction date shows XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased another Alaska excursion through XXXX/XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$230.00}. The transaction date shows XX/XX/XXXX. 

I bought insurance for the excursion from XXXX XXXX for {$13.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The transaction date shows XX/XX/XXXX. 

Totaling {$730.00} I purchased these excursions in XX/XX/XXXX for my XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX. The cruise was canceled and I rescheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. Instead of receiving a refund, the company said they would honor the two excursions for the XXXX XXXX XXXX 

I then received word from my travel agent in XX/XX/XXXX that XXXX/XXXX XXXX was in financial default and no one would be receiving their money or get their excursions. I was told by my agent to file a claim with the credit card company for a refund due to NOT receiving the services I paid for. I filed a claim by phone on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received notification that the claim was denied and closed. 

I went inside the bank this time on XX/XX/XXXX, to file another claim. I spoke to an associate who had to file the claim by phone. She explained to the person that I had not received the services for which I paid for and explained to them the business was in financial default under receivership ( State of Wisconsin ). The person told the associate the issue was between me and the merchant. She then reiterated that the business was in financial default. The claims person said they were not responsible for the Government shut down and refunding me the money. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to file a claim online with Wells Fargo. I can not do so because the online banking is not showing the transactions for those purchases. It shows all my other purchases, but not those mentioned above. I do have them on my XX/XX/XXXX bank statement. 

The debit/VISA credit card used was through Wells Fargo Bank. 

Thank you in advance for your assistance."
333,"I called Wells Fargo to resolve a complaint about interest charges due to an issue of Wells Fargo not debiting my account for the credit card fees. Wells Fargo fixed that issue and offered to set up automatic payments for my credit card so this issue would not arise again. I agreed. 
six months later while reviewing my bills I realised that I was being charged monthly interest. On contacting wells Fargo they told me they automatic payments have been set up for the minimum amount due and not the full amount. when setting up the automatic payment, I was not provided with this information.

I have requested Wells Fargo to refund the interest charged for the seven months as the minimum payment was set up without my authorization either by mistake by wells Fargo or maybe intentionally to earn unnecessary interest. 
It should be noted that there is no easy way for setting up automatic payment online at the Wells Fargo site, nor is the information that only minimum payments are being chrged clearly shown on the online credit card statement. 
It was only when I downloaded the PDF statements was I able to see and understand what was happening."
337,"Wells Fargo is the holder of a line of credit I received through XXXX XXXX XXXX. Im not sure if its considered a Wells Fargo credit card because it has a higher balance than what I utilized from the store. They have informed me that there is a policy that any late payment, even by one single day, is subject to fines that can not and will not be discharged or waived. There is no recourse the public has to contest these fees. There is absolutely no grace period for this either. I had attempted to explain a number of health issues and hospitalizations and technical issues on the side of Wells Fargo that has prevented timely payments."
338,"Throughout the years I have made payments with all my credit cards and they have always first paid the highest interest rate balance first and then if any money was left from the payment, the bank would pay it toward the rest. I did a balance transfer payment to my Wells Fargo signature credit card on XX/XX/XXXX for an amount of {$7500.00}. I had made other payments that month one for the minimum and another just to round up my balance, {$250.00} and {$150.00}. The additional {$7500.00} was supposed to pay off my purchasing balance ( whatever I had bought that month ) and a portion of a promotional rate ( with a balance of {$6300.00} ) which was expiring that month ( expiring XX/XX/XXXX ) into regular rate. I had just obtained another promotional rate from Wells Fargo which was 0 % until XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$5000.00}. What Wells Fargo did was, they took the {$7500.00} and divided it into 3 and paid it toward 1 ) {$1500.00} toward Purchasing balance 2 ) {$3300.00} into the promotional rate balance that was expiring XX/XX/XXXX leaving me {$2900.00} of {$6300.00}. 3 ) {$2700.00} of the {$7500.00} was applied toward the promotional balance of {$5000.00} at 0 % that will expire on XX/XX/XXXX leaving a {$2300.00} balance. I called Wells Fargos Credit card customer service line and they said it shouldnt have been applied that way and they will try to fix it. They said that they will make an exception and send the money back to my savings instead of sending it back to the Credit card which I did the balance transfer from so that I can remake the payments so they would apply the balance to the lower interest rate. This never happened and I called back. They told me their colleagues gave me the wrong information, they cant do that, actually they cant do anything. They told me to file a complaint with them, so, I did and the investigator sent me an email and said they did the right thing and they cant change it. I am so frustrated because none of my credit cards including Wells Fargo have ever done this to me. I always pay down or off high interest credit cards and this is the first time they divided it and applied one third of the payment towards a 0 % rate. I am brining this to your attention because I dont think this is in the best interest of any consumer to experience what happened to me. I would like to know if there would be anything your agency could do to raise awareness and make this right."
345,Charging overdraft for items not overdrafted
346,"On XX/XX/XXXX, for car repair service at XXXX, XXXX, VT I was charged {$380.00}, which I paid by Wells Fargo XXXX XXXXXXXX. This morning I wanted to dispute that transaction, because : XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX I haven't authorized. I brought the car in for exhaust repair. I specifically instructed them in writing not to perform the state inspection until that repair is done. That repair was not done that day because the parts needed to be ordered. Yet, I was billed for inspection. I do not know why I was billed for an inspection, that I asked NOT to be done, unless repairs, I acknowledged that needed to be done, were completed. I was also, actually, billed for the "" state sticker '' as a part received, but I did not find the sticker affixed to my windshield. I should not be asked to pay for parts not received. I did not even realize I was billed for inspection until I reviewed the bill at home. 

2 ) Furthermore, I was overcharged for parts. For one allegedly bad rubber bushing, they changed an entire control arm. I paid {$180.00} for part # XXXX. Which I later found far cheaper in 3 separate locations XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX - {$85.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX - {$83.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX - {$52.00} 3 ) In the lengthy write-up of everything that is wrong with my, otherwise perfectly fine, driving vehicle, they noted that there was no oil in the car and that there was an oil leak ( they did not mention that to me in person ). I checked the engine oil and the engine afterward and the oil level was appropriate and there were no signs of any leakage. 

4 ) there is no explanation for the item "" misc. supply '' ( {$17.00} ) in the bill, and I don't know why should I pay that So, I went to file a dispute online on my Wells Fargo account profile, but after repeatedly trying, I was unsuccessful. Their online dispute submission system always freezes in step 2 of 3, when after clicking on the 'continue ' button, instead of being taken to step 3 nothing happens.

I then engaged in 'live chat ' with 3 equally uninformed, incompetent, and unhelpful customer service representatives who were just eager to explain what they can not do ( file the dispute over chat, give me a direct email where to submit my dispute, give me a regular mailing address where I can send it by USPS ). 

Instead, they were telling me that I must call them. I disagree. This is not an accessible service. I am hard of hearing. They are mandated by the XXXX to provide accessible service to me. And the phone is not that. I want to communicate in writing. Every business in the US of A has to have a legal mailing address, including Wells Fargo, and I am urging you to demand they provide it to me. 

Further researching online I found out they have mailing address for people to send supporting documentation with their disputes ( Wells Fargo Dispute Resolution Department, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX IA XXXX ), and I sent my dispute there by certified mail, return receipt requested.

The chat agents also gave me the usual spiel about how my computer, my operating system, my browser, and my cache may be wrong, and gave me directions about a hundred different time-consuming and inconvenient steps that I should perform in the hope to submit my dispute online, as I should have been able to do in 10 minutes this morning, instead of wasting 2 hours on those morons.

There is nothing wrong with my computer- I am filing this just fine. But to satisfy the form, I actually try to access my Wells Fargo account tonight from a completely different computer ( with a different browser and operating system ), and I was obliged to enter the code they texted to my phone, as this was the first time I tried to access my WF account from that computer. And, guess what - the same exact thing happened when I try to file the dispute : their system did not let me move on past step 2 - which while being frustrating and infuriating proves their chat folk is lying : there is nothing wrong with my tech, but the problem is on their side. 

Either their website is just accidentally malfunctioning and buggy or this is a deliberate effort to quash disputes, and to make them more time-consuming to file, by offering this bogus online system, that they know doesn't work, and then directing people to call them and waste further hours and hours on hold with them. I believe what they do is illegal, and I expect your swift action. 

While i was reviewing my WF account profile I noted two messages from them. One from XX/XX/XXXX where they acknowledge that I changed my email address from XXXX to XXXX. Then there is another one from XX/XX/XXXX which states that an email they sent to my XXXX address returned undeliverable. There are several frustrating and infuriating details about that. First, why are they sending an email to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX if they acknowledged on XX/XX/XXXX that I changed email address to XXXX? Who is doing their IT?? 

And, second - what problem do they have with delivering emails to XXXX? I receive hundreds of emails daily to that address, even from a bank in XXXX, and absolutely nobody has any problems with delivering emails to that address except for Wells Fargo and XXXX credit cards. I suspect they might be using the same IT geniuses for emailing services, who for some idiotic security reason, that I can't even identify yet, don't like my balkansnet email address. 

Also, on XX/XX/XXXX I once received this message in my browser : This page cant be displayed Turn on XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX in Advanced settings and try connecting to https : //www.wellsfargo.com again. If this error persists, it is possible that this site uses an unsupported protocol or XXXX XXXX  such as XXXX  ( link for the details ), which is not considered secure. Please contact your site administrator. 

Again, this happens with no one else. I don't know who they think their customer are? Software engineers exclusively? They should make sure their online services are accessible to all their customers not just those with the latest model computers and the latest operating system update ( however, the other computer I used is brand new with new XXXX and I still could not submit the dispute online. 

I want you to convey to them that I don't give a XXXX about which XXXX XXXX they consider secure, I only care about convenience of access, and if they can't provide that, they can not count on me as a customer."
347,"I have Wells Fargo credit card. 
Payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX for {$16000.00} some change As usual I have submitted payment on XX/XX/XXXX thru Wells Fargo website. The money was transferred to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX from bank to Wells Fargo as an ACH transfer. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I tried to charge {$2400.00} on credit card which was declined, after calling Wells Fargo they said they have not received money from bank thats why they put a 15 day hold then I called my bank to inquire why the money was not sent to Wells Fargo even though money was taken out of my account they said they did send the money to Wells Fargo thru ACH. 
I called Wells Fargo second time then they tell me they did receive money because of large amount they put a hold on for 15 days, I have reminded them we are not in XXXX or XXXX we are in XXXX I submitted for payment on XXXX and they submitted to my bank XXXX and my bank sent the money on XXXX. They said there is no guarantee it could take up to 30days to have access credit that has been posted to your account. 
I went ACH website it says funds are normally cleared within 3 to 5 days. 
My feeling is because I pay my Cc balance fully every month they are restricting home much I charge because they are not making any money from me using their credit card."
348,"XXXX dollar around. 
I filed the claim to the my bank well fargo. I thought it will be resolved easily. I purchased something from the personal seller. It was a broken and dirty item. After I received it, I got sick because of its weird smell. And my floor had a lot of tiny Black bugs insects. I had to visit the doctor after that. The doctor said that I probably got affected by bad air or gas. The only thing I have touched with is that item. 

I filled the claim to the well fargo claim center. They never asked me any information. I have all pics and proof. Nobody contacted me. They just closed my case without a reason."
352,"I have a Wells Fargo credit card which has multiple companies set up receive recurring payments from it. It is the policy of Wells Fargo that they delay applying payments they receive toward the credit limit, even though they do credit them towards the balance remaining. Consequently, I have repeatedly exceeded my credit limit and had {$0.00} credit left, even when my balance as shown on their own app was less than half of the limit. For example, this month I initiated a payment of {$8000.00} using the Wells Fargo app on XX/XX/XXXX. This amount was withdrawn from my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. Since then I have also made payments ( using my checking account 's online banking ) for {$2000.00} and {$1000.00}. All of these payments show up on the Wells Fargo app, which shows the current balance this morning as XXXX XXXX of my credit limit, but my "" credit left '' remains at {$0.00} and it is now XXXX XXXX XXXX days after the {$8000.00} was withdrawn from my checking account! 

This policy by Wells Fargo is completely UNACCEPTABLE. I have had much inconvenience and lost money because of it. No other financial institution with which I work takes more than 3 business days to fully credit an ACH payment. I will be switching to another credit card company, but want to warn other consumers to AVOID WELLS FARGO credit cards!"
354,"Applied for credit card, made a requirement to update phone number with credit bureau. Complied updated phone number. Called back and verified I met criteria. Still was denied based on same reason. Company wants to re run credit even though I met criteria within time given."
357,Did you certified to the bureaus that the account XXXX was reporting accurately before XX/XX/20? XXXX or no? Because you reported false information to the bureaus about me and therefore you must delete account XXXX I supplied you factual information and proved you wrong therefore you will have to remove this account from all bureaus you will not go in and add information that was provided to you. Due to the fact thats what you guys do dont verify anything so no you will remove this account immediately no ands buts.
362,"I have many bank products with Wells Fargo. However I have one of my bank product which Is a business credit card account that I had with Wells Fargo for over 5 yrs now that I was making payment and using on a monthly basis that Wells Fargo decided to close this account without my consent around XX/XX/2022. After doing so they started to apply late payment fees and interest rate fee XX/XX/2022 on the remaining balance that I had when they involuntarily closed my business credit card account which I had just made a payment towards that same week/month. From there I started getting collecting phone calls day and night from Wells Fargo about making payment on the account because it was past due and every time I asked the clerk to explain to me why my account was closed unexpectedly, they always replied back without an actual reason ( s ) and proceed to press me to pay the past due or late payment. I even had a rep that goes by the name of XXXX that will call my phone nonstop and even leave voicemails in regards to me paying them instead of explaining to me why they closed my business credit card account which I work so hard to maintain from an unsecured business credit card with my own money to a secured business credit card after couple of years building relationship with Wells Fargo. I have been a loyal customer with Wells Fargo for more then 12 years and that's how they showed their appreciation by closing my business credit card account without my consent."

To reiterate : I agreed to ONLY a credit check and did NOT authorize the credit card or line of credit be created under my name."
366,"Wells Fargo has submitted correspondence to me which is nothing but lies. I resent people and businesses that is going to purposely lie about what they have done wrong. First of all, my issues with this bank did not start on XX/XX/XXXX. The fraud to my checking account never resolved, The fraud with a Lien never resolved and now The fraud with my Credit Card along with The Super Checks has all became hidden secrets, I am so tired of fighting with this corrupt bank in doing the right thing. I have contacted so many attorneys from New Jersey to Georgia to pursue a case against this bank for their fraud, negligence and lies they have been telling for too many years. This bank does what XXXX does, drag their corruption out until they have passed the timeline of the one, they have. this bank has had so much time to correct their fraud. like corruption, it goes without resolution if you give up. I have not given up from the day I discover what this bank has done to me and my money. deceived me and stole my money. This issue with my Credit Card started on XXXX XXXX. I took {$200.00} cash advance off my credit card, I redeposited {$210.00} later and the {$10.00} extra was not for a cash advance fee because I did not owe one. yet the bank took it as such. I replaced that cash back on my credit card 20 minutes later, which I had been told by many employees that if I deposit the money back within the hour it will not affect the account. it will be a wash with no fees. this is what happen. On XX/XX/XXXX, I took {$2800.00} cash to Wells Fargo to pay off my credit card. I called the automated to get the balance which it stated XXXX without realizing that the other bank had checks that need to be cover also. what I did was take the money from my checking and put it all on Wells Fargo credit card. I got back home and realized the money should have been taken to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I call the credit card department, told them what happen and to transfer the {$610.00} into my checking account. The {$200.00} that was taken was already included in the statement because the statement had closed on the XXXX of XXXX and the transaction happen on XXXX XXXX which is the part of accounting the branch manager nor XXXX XXXX seem to not understand the reason I could not get this understood. this is really bad when your top people do not understand the simple fundamental of accounting and closing of statements and dates. I was told by Wells Fargo customer service I had to wait 2 days until it can be done. I waited and the money was not there. the {$41.00} was still there, not the additional {$610.00}. I called customer service to see why my deposit was not there. I was told nothing was done and she will be more than happy to do it now, but it was going to take 7 days. I was so confused on why would cash money have a hold on it. I asked her and she said it was cash. I told her yes and it is available immediately so why did I have to wait the first time when you should be able to see the type of deposit when you are in a customer account. The transaction was still not being done. I hung up the phone and called my attorney, told her what happen, she told me to use that credit card to get my own money back. the balance was XXXX and the account could not be a cash advance because it was extra. once i took my money back from the same teller I had used throughout this entire business, when I went back to show her what Wells Fargo had done, she was either fired or quit, we will never know until we find her. The transactions on my credit card account is # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX every last one. I never had any transactions on card # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This is Wells Fargo new card that they generated on their own without me requesting a new card for any reason. The only fraud on my card was the fraud Wells Fargo did. I had already reported the XXXX XXXXXXXX and the {$19.00} in XXXX before all the craziness to XXXX XXXX. This bank put my money that was mine as a cash advance on their new card with all the fees. that new card should have had XXXX brought forward while waiting for the XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX statement to drop which would have had the new purchases on it and nothing else. instead, they brought over all their own mistakes off my original card and placed it on their new card in order to commit more crimes against me. If Wells Fargo was not so corrupt in their business, they would have not taken a customer money and made it into money that belong to them. this bank should be called XXXX bank. everything is theirs 's. forget about the fact that it did not belong to them from the first place. I was sent their Super Checks to go on vacation, consolidate bills for 2.9 % interest rate. I am thinking because I paid off the card, they were giving me an incentive. I used the 3 checks # XXXX XXXX to pay off bills and to pay the cash bail for my son. The bank cleared all 3 checks and the merchants posted the cash to my accounts and the XXXX was also available in my XXXX XXXX XXXX Account. Wells Fargo reached out to this business because they are their business customers. These entities was contacted by Wells Fargo to get the money back. you want to know what is so crazy and illegal about what they all did. they went into my accounts and took back cash money without my permission nor my knowledge. As far as the law is concern, my debts are paid in full and the XXXX XXXX XXXX need to be charge by the CFPB with theft by taking. make them replace every XXXX of my cash back into my account and to never touch the account unless both parties has been served with a court order. other than that the bank committed a crime and I want them punished. The error that XXXX XXXX made also cost me insufficient funds fees of 3 transactions. The fraud that you committed in opening up accounts in people names without their authorization does not express pride nor quality customer relations. look at what you have done to me. stealing my Social Security check money from my account, knowing full well the law states that any bank account with the direct deposit of a Social Security Check is exempt from liens. it never stated the names had to be examine. The Social Security Check was the only rule for exemption, and this is why all expenses that was occurred should be reimbursed by you. XXXX XXXX XXXX is my shero. you gave her my bank statements without my permission nor knowledge and through XXXX blessing she has become my XXXX of truth in holding you accountable for the fraud that she find in my bank statements because of her experience on the bench with the exact cases that stole my money off my Debits Cards in which you all know. then to tell the me that the merchants who has my money for no reason and who was willing to put it back into my account through Wells Fargo because that is how they got it and Wells Fargo refuse to reach out to the names and numbers of all 7 merchants to retrieve my money back. This is a true sign that Wells Fargo also has to reimburse those charges also. The problem is my expectations has never been a priority to Wells Fargo, this is why I received a nasty letter from you calling me a liar about corrections facility. If you had listen to my first and second conversation with your customer service representative after the Mediation you would have heard me say that there is only two corrections entity that I am familiar with since XXXX and that is XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. these were the only two entities in XXXX XXXX had licenses to operate in the facility my son was in. all the charges of corrections on my cards, I have no idea how, why, what, when and how was these other facilities was able to get my information to do this. Wells Fargo did nothing to correct the money that has been taken away from me including the money they just placed on me as theirs 's. Any decent human being would have thought by now that the scandal this bank has experience through their corruption, they would try their best to be careful and copable for what happen in their organizations. It seem the problems has gotten worst than better. I know now it is best for me to reach out to XXXX XXXX XXXX to get the help I need to make these banks accountable for their corruption on me and probably so many other consumers. I still can not believe that Wells Fargo would submit a answer with nothing but lies, including leaving off the most pertinent information. THE ORIGINAL CREDIT CARD WHERE THE FRAUD OCCURRED. THEY CLOSED IT AND HID IT BECAUSE THOSE SUPER CHECKS WAS FROM THAT CREDIT CARD NUMBER. THEY LIED, CLOSED IT AND STATED THE ACCOUNT WAS CLOSED. NEVER HAPPEN UNTIL XXXX XXXX WHEN THEY CLOSED IT WITHOUT NOTIFICATION TO ME. FRAUD AND LIES IS RAMPANT IN THIS BANK."
367,I opened up a credit card with Wells Fargo back in 2014 and wasn't able to pay it back due to financial hardships. I just turned XXXX at the time and had a XXXX on the way and was making $ XXXX/hr part time at my job and it wasn't enough to make payments back to the card. I didn't know anything about credit or how it worked back then and now that i am older i see the damage that it has made on my credit report. It is hard to apply for any type of loans now or buy anything due to this negative remark on my credit report.
368,"I purchased a roundtrip ticket using my debit card from XXXX XXXX in XXXX for the XXXX season. I ended up cancelling my trip because I called XXXX and asked if my trip was eligible for a refund. The representative told me it indeed was- after I gave her my flight information and so on. She told me to fill out the cancellation and refund request online. So I did. A few days later I get an email from XXXX saying they wont be able to refund me. 
I call XXXX and told them what happened and why I cancelled the trip and what their representative told me. They refused to give me a refund. I called them again later in the day and escalated to the problem to a manager. They refused, so I turned to my bank, Wells Fargo. 
WF was took all my information. I told them what happened they gave me a credit to my card and told me they would investigate the case. 3 months later and they have closed the claim and took the credit back.

Im a little lost on what to do here since XXXX representative told me I was eligible to a refund. I dont know what to make of WF decision since Im not sure they fully investigated the situation."
369,This account was fraudulently opened in my name
370,"Back in XXXX of 2021 I received a letter from XXXX stating my personal information had been compromised and they would provide me free 2 yr identity protection. During the process of signing up for the protection I discovered that 2 accounts had been opened using my personal information. When I reached out to one of the issuers being Wells Fargo they informed me that a full investigation would be completed, and a "" detail '' report would be provided to me at the end of their investigation. I never received any documents regarding the case and how the credit card was opened and when I went into the bank branch was to there was nothing fraudulently found and was informed that my credit card was closed, and they issued the perpetrator of my stolen identity a new card in their name. I was clear with Wells Fargo that I needed the report in order to prosecute the criminals who stole my personal information. 
The other credit card company will be filed in a separate complaint."
371,"I was at an atm in XXXX XXXX using my debit card. Several people were around, one said I did not close my account after a cash withdrawal. He pointed to the atm screen which appeared at first glance to remain open. He said I should reinsert my card to close it. I reinserted my card and the atm would not return it to me. I suspect the surrounding people jammed the atm somehow. I made many many attempts to obtain my card from the atm to no avail. I returned home and immediately called my bank, explained the situation and asked them to block my card. I check my card activity online after the call requesting the block. No unusual transactions occurred at that time. This occurred at approximately XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I checked my card activity later and noted several unauthorized transactions totaling approximately {$3700.00}. Early on XX/XX/XXXX I went to the local police office and filed a fraud/theft report. I notified my bank of the of the fraudulent transactions. 
My bank subsequently denied my claim. They never contacted the bank where the fraud occurred seeking video which was available, they never asked for the police report, they never contacted me in any way until I called requesting the status of my claim. I was told it was denied, no reason was given. I later, on XX/XX/XXXX received a letter at my U.S. address saying the claim was being benied and suggesting I was complicit in the fraud. I should also note that approximately 4 years prior I lowered the daily withdrawal limit on my card to {$1000.00}. Wells Fargo unilaterally raised that limit without asking or notifying me. 
I have contacted my bank, Wells Fargo repeatedly protesting their denial. I am still awaiting a response."
373,My credit card at Wells Fargo was used for fraud in that a series of on-line transfer were made to the credit card which I did not authorize. My credit limit was {$15000.00} and the on-line transfers were for more than {$41000.00}. Wells Fargo now claims that my credit card balance is over {$41000.00} and is demanding payment.
375,"Summary : Wells Fargo Bank denied my credit card application because I did not submit a telephone number to receive messages from them, after their representative told me I could apply without doing so. The representative and her superior later identified the lack of telephone number as the reason for denial. I was sent a false letter by the Bank giving me a deadline to agree to submit the telephone number, when the application had already been denied when the letter was sent. This denial is the first I have ever received over 35 years of using credit cards, and will damage my credit score. 
XXXX XXXX, XXXX : Applied for XXXX card after receiving promotional in the mail. Provided all information in detail, but refused my cell phone number for privacy reasons. Representative said the application could be made without it. 
XXXX XXXX, XXXX : Date of letter from Wells Fargo telling me I had until XXXX XXXX, XXXX to provide my cell number for the application or it would be rejected. 
XXXX XXXX, XXXX : Date of my receipt of that letter. I called XXXX immediately and by chance got the same representative, "" XXXX '', as on the XXXX XXXX call. I asked to cancel the application, since I did not want my cell number used. She informed me she could not cancel it. The call was escalated to a supervisor, who told me the application had already been rejected. The XXXX XXXX letter was a clear falsehood. The supervisor apologized pro forma, said "" the system '' had generated the false letter, and told me nothing could be done. 
I have had dozens of credit cards over 35 years, including one continuously since approximately XXXX. I have a high credit score, and am XXXX. It will be damaged by this action of XXXX."
377,"on XX/XX/2022 my credit card was charged 4 fraudulent charges : 1 XXXX XXXX  for - {$57.00} 2 XXXX XXXX - {$20.00} 3 XXXX XXXX for {$20.00} 4 XXXX charge for {$500.00} I reported it immediately to my Wells Fargo credit card and they investigated and decided that all the charges were fraudulent except the XXXX one. After many attempts of requesting information on their investigation to see how they came up with the conclusion that all the smaller charges were fraud and the large one was not. I have requested documents of their investigation and they refuse to provide it but yet expect me to just pay for it. It is absolutely frustrating, but then again its Wells Fargo and they feel thay can just get away with anything."
378,"I recently disputed this information with the credit beaurus and they stated this information was valid I have received no paper work confirming the validation of this account. This is a violation of my consumer rights. Ive been distressed and struggling through this pandemic to soon find out this false information is apprearinng on my report Ive listed all the violations that have been violated 806.

379,"On XX/XX/2020 - I went to my local Wells Fargo drive through ( lobby was closed due to Covid-19 ) and I asked to make a cash {$2700.00} credit card payment. I placed {$2700.00} in XXXX dollar bills, my Driver 's License and card inside the drive through container. 

I waited approx. 9-10 minutes to receive my personal items back. The receipt was inside a Wells Fargo envelop with the cash that I withdrew along with my Driver 's license and card. 

I didn't think much of the transaction or particular event, since I do this every single month after I get paid on the XXXX of every month. After some time, I noticed that my credit card payment NEVER reflected on my credit card balance. I did notice that they had deposited {$270.00} into my preferred cheechink account. That money came from a check that was made out to XXXX XXXX ( I have no relationship or knowledge of this person ). 

I called Wells Fargo credit card department and asked about my payment not being posted. They asked me for a receipt and I explained that I was not given a receipt for my {$2700.00} credit card payment. I was given a {$270.00} receipt for someone else 's deposit. 

I was asked to go reach out to the local branch manager and explain the situation. The following morning I went to the same branch where I made my credit card payment and explained the situation. The manager explained that they were going to have to look and check their systems. 

I received a call from the branch manager and I was told to contact Wells Fargo Credit again and that they would be able to help me further ( they were unwilling to provide me with my {$2700.00} credit card payment receipt ). 

I called Wells Fargo again and told them what the branch manager had said to me, which was to contact Wells Fargo again. The agent on the phone told me that they would have to escalate this to the Executive Office level. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was connected dispute especialist, XXXX XXXX. He assigned me a case number and told me that I would need to contact the branch manager and request a receipt. I explained to him that I had already tried this, but the branch manager was unwilling to provide me with a receipt. 

He explained that he would have to "" look into it ''. I was also told that these complaints have a timeline of 5 business day, to which I agreed. 

It is now XX/XX/XXXX ( WAY past the 5 day mark ), I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX, my dispute specialist at the Wells Fargo Executive Office level. He explained that he 1 ) "" got in touch with the branch manager and were not able to locate my payment '' and 2 ) "" reached out to the finance department and asked for a possible deposit '' I tried asking probing questions to check if he actually followed through. I asked him if he could tell me the name of the branch manager that he was in touch with. He responded "" I can't recall the name '' I also asked him if he had the name of the person from the finance department who he was working with. He responded "" I just submit a general inquiry through the system '' At this point, I am very frustrated with Wells Fargo and the local Wells Fargo branch. it has been more than 3 months and I still don't have my credit card payment in my account."
381,"I am writing about my account with Wells Fargo Account # XXXX which I addressed previously via the CFPB in regards to the late pay reported in XXXX 2020. I did get a response dated XXXX/XXXX/2020 to which it says they can not honor the CARES ACT to update the account in XXXX 2020. In my previous complaint I addressed Covid being the reason the late occurred in the first place and an accommodation was made were fees were waived. Since the accommodation was made no reporting should be reflected in XXXX 2020. 

You state the payment was reversed which is exactly the effects of covid causing that to be returned."
385,"I have a deferred interest Wells Fargo Credit Card I used 18 months ago to purchase new windows for my house. I was very careful to make sure I paid off by the due date to avoid the large interest payment. All of the payments were done with autopay until a month before the last payment was due, I personally called and told the representative I wanted to pay off my card. I made it clear I wanted to pay it off early so there was no chance I would get the large penalty. She took my bank info and gave me a confirmation number that the payment was applied and when I asked, she assured me the card was at a XXXX balance and I had in fact paid off the balance to avoid the large interest payment. 

A month later, I get a statement telling me I owe nearly {$2000.00} in interest. I was shocked and called them right away. I spent 2 hours on the phone with various reps and supervisors. They told me that apparently the last payment didn't go through because there was a transposed or missing number in the bank account number. Although I was never contacted and told this! I reminded them that I had done auto pay for 17 months and Wells Fargo had no problem accessing my bank account for all of those payments! I told them the confirmation number I received when I made the last payment but I was told that this is not confirmation that the payment went through. They offered to reduce the interest fee by 75 %. Not acceptable to me."
386,"XX/XX/2018 {$1100.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ID # XXXX XX/XX/2018 {$1000.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ID # XXXX I never signed any credit card agreement to pay the company this amount they charged, but they forged my name on their charges they submitted. I never would have agreed to charges of these amounts, The company provide me no written contract or agreement and then tried to charge extreme amounts other than quoted. They verbally quoted about XXXX XXXX dollars to take to another location. They threw possessions in the truck which caused significant damage to total loss, stole many possessions, broke multiple possessions, and stole funds by falsifying charges from the verbal quote. They had the credit card number so just charged what they wanted without any written agreement, additional verbal agreement, and far greater than what i would have ever agreed. After the incident I had received very bad information about this company and that they intentionally steal from parties of whom they are moving or storing. 

I tried to follow this matter with the merchant and they were actually frightening and intimidating as to what they would do to me if I ever contacted them again. The owner and his men working were most abusive, scary, intimidating and frightening, as they used foul language to me repeatedly. They threatened harmful actions if I reported anything against them. They were very mean to me and argued against any proper consideration and treatment of me as I tried to ask of them. 

WF again mishandled the claim and did not follow through. We raised it repeatedly, filed Reconsiderations and I completed other forms for WF, but WF never even considered handling it again as they lost their time frame so did nothing."
390,"To whom it may concern I disputed Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX the original dispute was included in bankruptcy was not added to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. You claim the information was added i revised the credit report with a new credit report the information is still not there which put you in FCRA i demand that you remove this account in its entirety I asked you to review XXXX credit report that is uploaded and circle where do you see included in bankruptcy! 
Also you failed to notify the bureaus that consumer disputes!! Is another violation of the FCRA. 
Per the reporting agencies there was a updated done by you and you failed to note the account as consumer dispute. 


Also the account was open on XX/XX/2017 the payment history is incomplete which is another violation of the FCRA based on the credit report Wells Fargo I dont want to sue you for XXXX in FCRA violation but I will if I have too FCRA states consumer credit report must be 100 % accurate and verified remove the account from XXXX XXXX and XXXX immediately"
393,I called in XXXX of this year to cash in my rewards. I was promised a check for over {$5000.00}. The check never came. I called back about XXXX weeks ago and was promised they would expedite the check and it never got here. Also Ive tried to cash rewards from them in the past and the same thing happened. Today I tried to resolve his issue again and was informed that the person could not get any supervisors on the phone to resolve this. I didnt even ask for a supervisor so I assume it takes a supervisor to complete this.
394,"When I was approved for a Wells Fargo credit card there was information on my credit report that caused the interest to be set at a rate that gouges me - approximately 25 %. I have informed Wells Fargo that this information has legitimately been removed and that they should re-review my rate. At my current XXXX credit score, I believe that my rate should be sub-20 %. Today a man called me to ACKNOWLEDGE that they have an internal department that reviews accounts for APR reductions but told me that he WILL NOT get in touch with hem to see if my APR can be reduced. They scam people by knowingly overcharging them for interest, in cases such as mine where they know there is a discrepancy. I will continue to work with the company and keep the CFPB abreast of their continued abuse of customers."
395,"Followup to CFPB case # XXXX As stated in the attached XX/XX/18 letter from Wells Fargo, XXXX rewards points were to post by XX/XX/18 for redemption. As of XX/XX/18, the points have yet to be posted."
399,"I am writing today about a charge that was made on my Wells Fargo credit card ( Ref. Claim No. XXXX ) in the amount of {$1100.00} from the company XXXX, which took place on XXXX. 

On XXXX I used by Wells Faro Visa Credit Card ending in XXXX to purchase airline tickets through a XXXX party service called XXXX. The tickets were for a round trip to XXXX, XXXX set to take off from New York ( XXXX ) on XXXX returning from XXXX to New York ( XXXX ) on XXXX. 

I was quoted {$1000.00} after I entered my Wells Fargo Visa Credit Card information and before I clicked Buy on the company 's website. ( Please see attached photo reference in attached Email 1 ). After the payment went through, I realized I had been charged {$1100.00} by kissandfly.com instead of the original amount quoted. 

I immediately contacted the company on XXXX and a representative on the phone told me that I was notified of a price change before I submitted payment. I told them I was not notified of a price change and sent them XXXX XXXX as proof. I received no reply so I called again on XXXX and requested that they cancel my booking immediately without penalty since I was within the XXXX grace period where a customer can cancel an airline ticket purchase with no penalty for full refund. 

US Department of Transportation Law states that consumers have the legal right to cancel any airline ticket purchased within XXXX hours of the initial purchase without penalty and with a full refund to the customer. 

The airlines that I purchased tickets on were XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. Both airlines representatives said that I absolutely had the right to cancel within XXXX hours, but the cancellation had to be through kissandfly.com since they were the third-party service provider. 
XXXX XXXX under the Refunds section XXXX XXXX under section XXXX Allow reservations to be Held or Cancelled for a certain period of Time On XXXX the XXXX representative agreed that I could be refunded and asked that I fill out a cancellation request on their website so they could approve the request since I was within XXXX hours of the initial purchase- please see attached Email XXXX. I completed the online refund request at XXXX XXXX ET on XXXX. I then received attached Email XXXX at XXXX XXXX ET on XXXX stating that I was being issued a refund, but I had to accept the refund by XXXX XXXX  ET that same day XXXX, otherwise I would not be issued a refund. 

I was not awake at XXXX XXXX ET to respond and agree ( nor would most anyone be for that matter ) and to impose a subsequent XXXX deadline to accept the refund by XXXX XXXX ET is absurd and purposefully deceitful. They then canceled the request and told me that I was no longer within the XXXX window and that they could not refund me- please see attached Email XXXX. This is incredibly unethical and harmful to me and other consumers. I was legally owed a refund and was manipulated and unlawfully forced out of that refund that was owed to me. 

I disputed this charge, explained this situation, and provided supporting documentation to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2022. I was notified by Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2022 that they would not refund the charge and that I would be forced to pay the charge from XXXX 

Today I would like to submit a formal complaint as I believe the review and dispute process was cumbersome, opaque, and biased. The outcome was wrong and I beleive I was wrongly charged by kissandlfy.com Please let me know if I can provide any further detail. Thank you."
400,"I have a credit card with Wells fargo and most often its been great. We have had a nice banking relationship. I am a business owner, and in trying to explain the issues that XXXX has brought upon my business, they didnt agree with my timeline, and hence my account is in collections with legal. I made a payment that didnt go through as my business has functions in XXXX. Now that coronavirus has been named, all companies are being given assistance on current bills, but my issues stemmed bAck in XXXX so unfortunately, they wont extend to me the same benefits current business are getting.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS BEING FORWARDED TO THIS DECEPTIVE PRACTICES. WELLS FARGO CLOSED MY CARD ENDING IN XXXX ON THEIR RULES OF DISCREPANCY, THEN OPEN CARD ENDING IN XXXX. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE COPY OF THE CHECK THAT WAS GIVEN TO THE LOAN COMPANY WAS PAID OFF ON XXXX XXXX, WAS CLEARED ON XXXX XXXX. DUE TO THIS FINANCE COMPANY IS WELLS FARGO CUSTOMER ALSO, THEY REVERSE THE PAYMENT OFF THE ACCOUNT THAT WAS CLEARED AND PAID IN FULL. AS AN ACCOUNTING PROFESSION WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS PAID IN FULL, THE ACCOUNT GOES INTO NON - ACTIVE IN WHICH NO ACTIONS CAN BE DONE TO THAT ACCOUNT ANYMORE. EVEN THE CUSTOMER WOULD BE GIVEN A NEW ACCOUNT NUMBER IF THERE WAS ANOTHER LOAN. WHY THESE TWO ENTITIES ALONG WITH XXXX GAVE THE PAYOFF BACK DIRECTLY TO WELLS FARGO WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION IS ILLEGAL. THESE ENTITIES WERE 2ND PARTIES, NOT FIRST PARTIES. THAT WOULD BE ME. WHAT EVER WAS DONE WITH THE CHECKS THAT WELLS FARGO SENT TO ME HAD MY CREDIT CARD NUMBER ON THEM. THIS WAS NOT FRAUD. I ASSUME THE CHECKS WAS FOR ME TO DO WHATEVER I WANTED TO DO BECAUSE THE INTEREST WAS ONLY 2.99 %. MY CREDIT CARD INTEREST IS VERY HIGH AND THIS IS THE ONLY REASON I ASSUME THE CHECKS WAS A DIFFERENT OFFER. NOW WELLS FARGO HAS ISSUED FALSE WRITING ON THE CHECKS TO THE MERCHANTS STATING THAT THE ACCOUNT WAS CLOSED. THE CARD WAS SHUT DOWN BY BY WELLS FARGO, NOT MY ACCOUNT. I HAVE ENDURED A SERIOUS FINANCIAL BURDEN BECAUSE OFWELLS FARGO DECEPTION IN TAKING MY EXTRA MONEY AND MAKING IT A CASH ADVANCE FOR NO REASON ACCEPT FRAUD IN THE SAME WAY THAT MY ACCOUNT WAS COMPROMISED BY HACKERS WITH READERS WHO CAN GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO SCAN YOUR CARD TO DUPLICATE SALES FROM MY CARD AS THOUGH I DID IT.

THIS IS LOOKING LIKE A PATTERN ON WELLS FARGO PART. THE WELLS FARGO REPRESENTATIVE SPECIFICIALLY TOLD THIS CUSTOMER THAT THE LIEN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS MEDIATION AT ALL. IF THAT WAS TRUE, WHY DID THEIR JUDGE ADD A LIE INTO THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A {$1000.00} CHECK SETTLEMENT. I WAS TOLD BY THE JUDGE THAT OUT OF THAT SETTLEMENT, I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO PAY TAX ON IT. WELL FARGO DID NOT GIVE ME THAT AMOUNT, IT WAS {$300.00} LESS.

I SEEM TO HAVE MISPLACED HER CORRESPONDENT BACK TO ME. I WILL FAX IT ON XX/XX/XXXX TO YOU. AS TO PROVE WHAT I AM STATING IS THE TRUTH."
406,"On Monday XX/XX/XXXX I contacted My XXXX XXXX customer service about returning broken, unsafe furniture. The customer service representative said that I could not return the furniture because it had been past their three day return policy. I asked where this policy was stated and he said it was given to me and was clearly printed on the back of my deliver receipt that the delivery driver gave to me and all he could do was set up a furniture damage claim to have the furniture replaced. I told him I wanted to talk to a supervisor and dispute this policy since this was the first time I had ever heard of a three day return policy. I spoke with the supervisor and she pretty much said the same thing and started the exchange claim. 

I then checked my security footage of the day my furniture was delivered and the drive didn't give me a single piece of paper, and when I asked for a copy of what I signed, there is NOTHING on the digital delivery receipt about a three day return policy!!!! 

So I checked the website and sure enough there is NOTHING on the website about a three day return policy either!!! I then called the manager XXXX at XXXX XXXX location, and explained the situation to her and she gave me a completely different story about the policy being on a sales receipt the delivery drive gave me! I again explained to her that nothing was given to me and she said that there was nothing she could do that I would have to file a claim with the company! 

So then at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX I get a text message from someone overseas requesting photos! I was livid about the time of day they were contacting me as I knew it was a violation of my consumer protections and rights, but I then get a completely different story from them about the how I supposedly agreed to a 3 day return policy. They then emailed me a copy of a receipt and email that I had never seen before, and the is when I decided to dispute the charge and fight this in court now! 

It is not okay for companies to lie about made up policies and then try to hold customers accountable for those made up policies! I signed and received no copies of anything that states there was a three day return policy, and I never received anything via email either!!!! 

I want my credit card company Wells Fargo to reverse the charge dated XX/XX/22 in the amount of {$1300.00} and hopefully the store will come pick up this broken and dangerous furniture! The furniture that was delivered not only has broken legs making the bed frame unusable, but there were chunks of varnish falling off, and the night stand wood was cut so crooked that the whole table wobbles making it completely unusable too!"
407,"on XX/XX/19 I went to a XXXX  dental office for a free consult. and by the end of the appt the dental office had some how in a very slick and quick manner conviced me that I needed all kinds of work done and when I said ok they opened a line of credit via wells fargo in the amount of {$8500.00}. and charged my "" NEW ACCT '' a total of {$8500.00} for services I had not even received yet. not realizing the office had already charged the acct I made a 2 appt on XX/XX/2019 to start the work. after returning home from second appt I received my wells fargo credit card statement which included a new charge in the amount {$8500.00} with an interest rate of 12.99 % which is very high as my credit score is close to 900. I called wells fargo right away to question the how they can charge the high interest rate on A+++ credit and knowing that I have another credit card with them in great standing with a lower rate. I was told that they had no control of the rate and that the dental office has the control to lower it. How is that possible? The dental office had the card number before I even had a chance to get the card in the mail and read over the terms and see the rates. If the office would have let the paperwork and card to be sent to me before they charged it I would not have said no to doing the work. I never signed a credit app or was not aware or told the fees and rate just charged. when I asked the dental office why the whole amount of {$8500.00} was charged before any work was really done I was told that in order to have the teeth impreions made into mouth plates that they needed to be paid in full for them. so I was under the asumsion that the cost for making the mouth plates would be charged only. not the whole amount quoted for "" Phase! '' work which by they way is the same amount of money no matter the patient or work to be done. I also never received an itemized invoice with item and amount for each in plain English so I can understand where the {$8500.00} was spent. I called the dental office and found out that they can or could change my interest rate would even give me 2 years with 0 % if paid in full at the end of 2 years. if not paid in full I would owe all the back interest rate and my rate would go back to the 12.99 %. how is it that the dental office can change or assign the rates and not the lending company? how is it that they can assign credit without looking at the credit score. they run a credit check to check credit but fail to get rates based apon the credit score. i have already closed the account in question and i am disputing the account and charges of {$8500.00}. And i stopped making contact with the dental office as well. and still don't have anything for the money that was charged. I feel that Wells fargo and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX are practicing unfair and predatory credit card lending and unfair business practices."
410,"Wells Fargo Bank not only used my information to open/close 14 stray accounts under my social security number and/or credit number known by the 3 credit reporting bureaus, making it a part of Wells Fargo 's multi-million dollar Cross-Selling scandal. They closed a charge ( s ) unauthorized, activities account and left me with fees steadily accruing after alleged closure and inactivity date ( s ). My credit is fine, have a few derogatory items to worry about  from prior to, two years account activities, for respected account ( s ). The only reason they could find for denial and an adverse action  is, "" Previous Wells Fargo checking or saving accounts not maintained as agreed. '' Granted by, otherwise denied, paid/repaid, authorized Wells Fargo overdrafts. This has been the denial since my first credit/bank account opening attempts in XXXX. I feel that this is illegal and discriminatory in action, like Wells Fargo not granting account immigrants accounts because of discriminatory reasons. It might be due to their discriminatory actions against XXXX or XXXX borrowers, such as the lawsuit discussed in XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo 's scandals in the past reporting 20 years. In XXXX. XXXX they flunked community lending. They will not overturn/overlook this decisive action. All I need them to realize, is that I can and am financially capable of handling, any/all, of my credit accounts show pos. payment history for last two years on all accounts and XXXX balance on closed accounts. Please remedy this situation with extreme hastiness as Wells Fargo needs to just quit discriminating and taking advantage of people, approve of my application and let go of derogatory information about me, on an internal level unless it's going to be public to me? But how when there's no records of previous account activity for any of my Well Fargo Bank Accounts ' previously and possibly fraudulently  opened without my knowledge."
414,"I have been trying to resolve an issue with Wells Fargo regarding charges to my credit card related to unauthorized transfers resulting in fees they assessed. These transfers, which resulted in a {$12.00} charge to my credit card was not done by me. They were either done by an employee within the Wells Fargo organization or done as the result of an error on the part of Wells Fargo 's banking systems, which happens often with this financial institution. However, they are now trying to force me to be responsible for paying these unauthorized charges ( fees ) in the amount of {$12.00} which is indeed fraudulent in nature. I have spoken to several representatives since XX/XX/2019 and to no avail have not gotten any satisfaction. They actually refunded half of the fraudulent fees, but left the remaining {$12.00} charged to my card. How is it that they would refund half of the unauthorized charges/fees, but leave the other half on my card? It doesn't make sense and no one within their organization can answer that question. They refuse to allow me to dispute this charge online via my portal so as to continue to assess fees to the card because I refuse to pay their fraudulent charges. 

I never authorized Wells Fargo to use a credit card account as a line of protection for any other accounts I've had with them over the years. This was something Wells Fargo did on their own. I never gave them permission to use this card for that purpose, however, they've done it and that in itself is fraudulent. For this reason, as well as my dissatisfaction with this bank for allowing this problem to go unresolved for 3 months, and other issues, I have closed ALL of my accounts. I believe their inaction in handling this matter is retaliation for me doing so. They are a scam and defraud customers to generate fee income on their products and services. I have been trying to get this issue of {$12.00} resolved since XX/XX/2019, and yet, I get nothing but the run-around with this institution. As a consumer, I will not be forced to pay for unauthorized charges or fees to a credit card or deposit account. For a bank like Wells Fargo to continue such an issue over {$12.00} is ridiculous. I want this matter resolved so I can be done with Wells Fargo indefinitely. They are not a banking institution worthy of managing my funds or financial accounts."
416,I have called XXXX numerous times from XX/XX/XXXX till present and are told that I am unable to set up a payment plan and that it is in the legal department and to call XXXX. Every single time that I ask to see if I can pay and I ask for a letter to be sent by mail stating that this debt is satisfies or my payment was received I am told that they are not able to provide me with such letter. I was deeply affected by the pandemic and was without a job from XXXX XXXX up until around XX/XX/XXXX. The interest rates are unfairly and incredibly high and I would like to file a complaint.
419,"I opened a Wells Fargo credit card account. I've had to replace the card several times because each time I get a new card, I use it for a couple weeks without problem but then I begin to see several charges that are not made by me. In the last month, I've had charges upward of XXXX from transactions like XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I've reported to Wells Fargo-they have credited some items, not all. I suspect that it's one of Wells Fargo 's employees who keeps getting ahold of my personal info. I never lend my card to anyone, all of the charges come at once because they know I always report the card stolen when this has happened before. I will be paying the charges that correspond to me, disputing the rest and closing the account."
420,"Wells Fargo closed my card without notice last XXXX XXXX They gave me no opportunity to pay any balance due and charged off on their own {$470.00} on XX/XX/2021. They immediately started reporting this to the Credit Bureaus as a charge-off. To reiterate, I was given no opportunity to cure on a card I spent about $ XXXX a month on - paying off constantly. 

To add fuel to the fire, the {$470.00} charge off amount had turned into multiple requests from Wells Fargo asking me to pay a balance due of {$1300.00}. Evidence is attached - the numbers do not lie. Why would the number be inflated? 

I appreciate resolution on this matter."
421,"I opened a Wells Fargo credit card to transfer my balance from XXXX XXXX. It was suppose to be completed by the XXXX. 

I now have an interest charge of {$80.00} for the balance transfer as well as the amount that ws suppose to be transfered. The problem is the transfer never happened. The entire amount is still on my XXXX XXXX card. So I had to make a payment and now I'll get charged interest which I was trying to avoid. That's why I got the 0 % apr card from We'll Fargo. 

I called them and they don't know what happened so they blamed XXXX XXXX. I then called XXXX XXXX and they said it's Wells Fargo. Finally, I got them on the line together and Wells Fargo can figure out what went wrong. Then they said it may take up to 90 days to figure it out. So I'll be accumulating interest on XXXX XXXX the whole time. They were also suppose to have somebody call me that's supposed to be researching it. I've received no calls. I called them back to speak to the Executive Office Case XXXX XXXX  XXXX Case number XXXX and she did not answer or call me back. 

So now I have 2 accounts and my debt has doubled now. So of course this will now effect my credit score and a I will end up paying an amount of interest I can't calculate. I have no idea what's going on or what they did. They need to take the payment amount I made to XXXX XXXX off the Wells Fargo Card as well deduct the percentage of interest they charged me for the transfer that never happened."
423,"I have a XXXX XXXX Credit Card which is serviced by Wells Fargo Bank. On my most recent statement, issued on XX/XX/2001, they charged me a minimum interest fee of {$1.00}. I have had the card for 3 years and they have never charged me a minimum interest fee ( I have maintained timely payments for three years ). I also did not receive any updated terms or conditions between this statement and previous statement so this is clearly an erroneous charge. I called the number at the back of my card on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with XXXX and was escalated to XXXX. They claimed the fee was correct because not all of my purchases from XXXX XXXX qualified for deferred interest. But I have made multiple purchases in the past with some that qualified and some that didn't, and they have never charged a minimum interest fee. I emphasized this to them, and also the fact that they can not just suddenly charge me a fee without notice. XXXX agreed to remove the {$1.00} charge. This was a week ago and the charge remains on the account. 

I re-read the statement and it states I have to dispute the charge in writing or they may not act on it, so I am mailing out a letter to them, certified, tomorrow. I understand this is just a {$1.00} charge but if they are charging 100,000 people this arbitrary charge then they have just stolen {$100000.00} from the public. I am also concerned that if they think they can get away with a {$1.00} charge this month they may charge me more next month and expect me to just pay that too. Please do not let Wells Fargo get away with this. They deserved to be penalized to the fullest extent of the law."
429,"XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo discontinued carrying "" secured '' credit cards, which I am a customer of. According to customer service agent this past XX/XX/XXXX, I was mailed a check XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of the "" secured '' card ( {$300.00} ). Well, over one year later, every time I contact them, all they can do for me is open a "" case '' to have someone eventually review, inform, and still not mail me {$300.00}. My accounts are now passed due, credit has been ruined, and they now tell me "" good luck. '' I'm homeless now, and it feels like when I go into a branch, they look at me like I'm crazy for asking for my money. I'm so shattered inside by this type of treatment. Sad, just sad."

However, on their Cell Phone Protection Guide to Benefits ( located here : https :  //www08.wellsfargomedia.comXXXX ) there is no clause that states that.

434,"WELLS FARGO SS # ISSUES I applied online in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX for a personal credit card. 
Wells Fargo approved my application immediately and issued a credit card with a {$14000.00} limit. Then when I tried to set up online access to the card I was unable to. I called Wells Fargo and they stated that the last digit of the social security number was entered as a XXXX instead of the correct ending number of my SS # which is a XXXX. They stated I would either have to fax/mail ( no scanning and emailing allowed ) them my SS # or I would need to drive XXXX miles one way to a banking center to show my social security card to have this corrected before I could have online access to see my account activity and make payments online. I spoke with Wells Fargo reps multiple times and told them that is is fraudulent to continue to allow me to use a credit card that they claim is attached to someone else 's social security number. Wells Fargo continue to allow me to make charges on the card but continues to state I can't get online access because the card is not under my social security number. I told them I could fax my ss card but that the emblem hides the last digit making it nearly unreadable. They said this would be okay and just to fax it anyway. I faxed them my XXXX XXXX XXXX ss card and recieved a letter from XXXX 's XXXX stating they can't read the SS #. and will still not be able update the credit card information ( from someone else 's so # to my ss # number ). 
I spoke with XXXX today XX/XX/XXXX and let her know I was reporting XXXX ' XXXX for allowing people to use credit cards that they state are in other people 's social security number. XXXX stated she understood and moved it up to an escalation dept that should get back with me. 
The other reason I am sending this message is because I know this is not a XXXX time mistake on by XXXX 's XXXX. It seems to be a calculated new plan of theirs. They did the same thing to XXXX of my workers earlier this year. He was working on a construction project and overheard my conversations with XXXX 's XXXX and told me about his own issue with them giving him a prepaid card then stating they got the SS # wrong and he would have to send them proof of social. 
I am also aware of XXXX 's XXXX 's past unethical practices. My first mortgage was through them and I received a class action payout years ago related to their past practices. 
I have tried to work with them for the past 2 months before having to report them. I gave them every chance to correct their reported practice of allowing people to charge on cards that they report are under someone else 's SS # but they refuse to fix the issue. At this point I am afraid they are going to make negative non-payment reports oneither my ss # or the person they state they have inappropriately listed as the card holder due to their error in their computer transposing the ss # number as they claim is what caused this issue. They state that once the computer makes a mistake from the number the applicant typed into the application to the computer which as an error and tends to transpose the SS # to an incorrect number on the card account - that they can't change it back to the correct number that was on the application with out a physical ss card. Nor have they stated that they have correcting the computer issue that is causing this issue in the first place. They clearly know this is an issue and choose to continue the practice."
435,"XXXX thought it was my bank and gave XXXX info acct #, exp date, sec code #. XXXX account was frozen until info was submitted. Then I realized later it was not my bank."
437,"Wells Fargo sent me a promotion which I registered for and met all the requirements in terms and conditions. They did not give me the account credit claiming that the offer ended on XXXX XXXX however I fulfilled the terms back in XXXX and the terms of the offer stated : "" Your Wells Fargo statement credits will be posted to your credit card account within 1 to 2 billing cycles of your purchase. '' It can been seen by their official link sent in the email below : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX? XXXX They need to honor their terms and not change them after the promotion has started. I called and asked to be credited as it had been 3 billing cycles and they denied saying that credits do n't post until after promotion ends. However the wording of the promotion clearly conflicts with what I was told verbally."
438,"On XX/XX/2022 I made a withdrawal of {$750.00} out of my banking account with my debit card. After about 3 hours, I received a call that showed up as Wells Fargo which is who I banked with at XXXX. The phone number was ( XXXX ) XXXX which I have the call log for. While I was talking on the phone the lady was informing me that they noticed a charge used in XXXX and if it was me. I said no that wasn't me, so they said ok they will freeze my card and they would replace it. During the call, she was telling me personal information about me to prove that she was legitimate. Personal information such as my address, my first 6 numbers of my social security card, and other info, so I believed her so when she asked for my PIN, I didn't think about it and gave it to her. Shortly after, she said I would be receiving a confirmation text with a code and to give her the code and to also not log on my banking account. During this time, I had a gut feeling something was off so I didn't tell her that text code. I then told her that I would call the bank on the back of my card or a number listed online. She was trying to say that she was legitimate and she kind of seemed desperate to keep me on which was a red flag. I hung up on her and immediately called the back of my card and informed them of the issue. After about 2 hours on the phone, the representative closed the account and made a new account for me. While I was looking at charges on the app to figure out what they did. I noticed they withdrew {$240.00} from my banking account and transferred my savings into my checking which I am assuming that was why they wanted that text message code that luckily I didn't give them. I was really fortunate on taking out that {$750.00} because they couldn't take out more than the {$240.00} due to the daily limit. When I looked at the details of the changes, it showed that the charges were done at a ATM in XXXX while I was at work in XXXX. About 1-2 weeks later, I received a notice from my bank saying that the charges were made using with my card and the PIN that I dumbly gave them so they said it must of been me or someone who had my debit card. I still had my card so that wasn't true, however I did ask for a replacement for my debit card which I didn't receive at all which was suspicious. I am not sure if they skimmed my card somewhere or used my replacement card. When I called the bank fraud line to dispute it, XXXX said unfortunately he couldn't help and that it wasn't possible for them to copy my chip so it must of been me that made the charge. If it was me, why would I do another withdrawal and go do the extra steps to transfer my savings to my checking when I could of just done them through my app."

442,"I received a credit card offer from Wells Fargo directly in my email inbox stating I had been invited to apply for their Platinum credit card. I responded to the offer and applied for said credit card. A week later, I received a letter denying my application stating as the reason : "" Not a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ''. 

I am a working, highly educated lawful XXXX, on a XXXX XXXX  and I have been a client of Wells Fargo since XXXX. The fact that my application was denied due to me not being a US XXXX XXXX  holder demonstrates that I was clearly discriminated against due to my XXXX XXXX  and lawful XXXX  status. They pre-approved me for a credit card but once I responded to the offer, I was unfairly treated, discriminated against on the basis of my XXXX XXXX. 
As a woman of color, XXXX  and belonging to an XXXX minority, I could not, in good conscience, stay silent as many now in America face discrimination and unfair treatment due to being a minority. 
I have reached out to Wells Fargo via email on XX/XX/XXXX, in regards to this matter but they have not responded to my claim. 

According to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act : "" The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the nations consumer protection agency, enforces the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( ECOA ), which prohibits credit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, NATIONAL ORIGIN, sex, marital status, age, or because you get public assistance. '' In XXXX, Federal Judge XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX ruled "" the right of noncitizens, including those with XXXX status, to be offered credit on the same terms as U.S. citizens in a lawsuit against Wells Fargo in a case identical to mine. 

In that sense, I do have grounds for legal action, however, I would rather settle this matter amicably, that is why I am reaching out to CFPB for assistance."
443,"My application for a credit card was denied by WellsFargo due to my national origin ( not a U.S citizen ) which is contrary to the federal equal credit opportunity act. My application was solely denied due to my national origin, not due to a low credit score or any other valid reason. 

For the records, my credit score is excellent ( XXXX with XXXX and XXXX ). I am a legal resident XXXX  in the U.S, and WellsFargo was the first bank I opened an account. To be denied by the same bank due to my XXXX orientation and national origin is totally unacceptable and contrary to the conduct of the bureau of consumer financial protection and the federal equal credit opportunity act."
448,"Attn : Office of the CEO - Wells Fargo I've always paid off my balances in full with Wells Fargo. I hardly carried any balances on my card or any other credit cards. I received offers for a 2.9 % balance transfer rate through Wells Fargo bank with the the payment of a transaction fee. Given the promotion and understanding that a low interest rate ( 2.9 % ) payable over months was a viable option when I became the victim of credit fraud ( XXXX XXXX Sheriff Department Case # XXXX ), I took the offer, thereby utilizing my credit lines with Wells Fargo XXXX and for which they charged a fee. It was then surprising to notice today that my credit line was being reduced to what the borrowed amount was. By doing so, my credit utilization has significantly dropped, despite me paying more than the minimum each month and well ahead of my XX/XX/XXXX date to payoff. This will indicate that I have a high utilization and a credit risk, whilst Wells Fargo forces me to pay off the balance to lower my utilization. Having paid the transaction fee, I purposefully didn't see an incentive to pay off the balance each month since the offer extended through XX/XX/XXXX. I am requesting Wells Fargo to reinstate my credit lines to the levels they were at since this reduction will cause lenders to think I am credit risk, for which I am not. Alternatively, they misrepresented their advertising. if they are unwilling to re-instate, then they should credit back the cash advance fees and I will pay off the balances in full. They can not have their cake and eat it, as their promotions is the reason I took the advance, understanding the time value of money. This should be done immediately and my credit report updated accordingly."
453,"Wells Fargo gave me a credit limit of XXXX, then when I was using the card, they just dropped my credit limit to under my balance, then charged me late fees and raised rate of late charges! I paid the card off, I was using the card monthly and they had a XXXX credit limit. I was using my card and paying it off at the end of the month to increase my points on 1.5 % on purchases! I was then hit with them again with them lowering my credit limit again to my balance for what they said was the way I was using my card is not what Wells Fargo XXXX department said! Now I have a XXXX fico score and they said that my use of the card was not what they wanted because I had low credit scores! So this is a lie because they said it was pattern based usage of the card! Then they charged fees and outrageous fees for cash transactions that I never made! I told them this should be illegal, apparently they have been doing a bunch of illegal transactions!"
457,"I did my banking with Wells Fargo. They approached me about a $ XXXX loan to pay off debt, which I took. Then, I hit a rough patch in steady employment. Later, I found out that Wells Fargo made up their own new rule, and unbeknownst to me, rolled out {$1500.00} as a charge off and took it off the bill ( it was hidden, I was unaware ). Now, years later they are saying I've missed payments on it, but I never saw that in a statement or bill. In fact, after I paid off both the loan and the credit card ( originating with checking/savings account ), I called them up and asked "" Where is my pay off letter? '' That's when I found out. They can't sneak out a chunk to continue ruining my credit 4 or 5 years later, can they? 

I consider this predator lending. I do not agree to pay this {$1500.00} whatever fee. When I asked, they confirmed they want to charge me that. I tried calling several times, with the intention of paying a small portion of it, but couldn't get through. 

It was awful - they hounded me during a stressful time when I was job hunting and actually made me miss important calls and leads. Once I paid off both bills, ( {$2000.00}, {$5000.00} at max ), I thought this would be over and just the lates would be on my credit report. 

I don't think what they did / are still doing is ethical, nor do I believe I owe this amount ( otherwise I would have paid it ). I've never heard of this before. It was fancy accounting they were not up front and honest about. Once I learned of this 'bill ', and said predator lending, they sent me a {$50.00} check, but I don't recall ever cashing it. 

When I disputed this via XXXX, my credit score decreased by 16 points, which caused me to fall into a lesser category. This affects a potential mortgage, and I hope to move next year. I'd like them to explain to you and other banks how a secret charge off can get used as a secret weapon to ruin one 's credit and life. It wasn't very nice of them! 

I pay my bills, and would like my credit score to reflect that."
459,"On XX/XX/2022, I was having trouble with my new TV and connecting to XXXX through the TV. Like many Americans, I reached for my phone and did a search on XXXX for XXXX customer service. Unbeknownst to me, the XXXX algorithm did not provide me with the actual XXXX customer service, but a number to scammers. 

Again, not knowing they were scammers, I called, and they informed me that there had been a security breach on my account, and that I needed to download an app called XXXX, and before I knew it they had me transfer XXXX cash advances in the amounts of {$2300.00} each ( not including cash advance fees ). Cash advances do NOT appear as pending on an account immediately, and then they had me XXXX the money to someone else. 

I immediately contacted WELLS FARGO and filed a complaint to which they investigated and their response was "" We processed these transactions as authorized '' nothing we can do, sorry XXXX. 

I then complained to the XXXX Offices, and once again, I was met with the response "" Our position has not changed, we processed the transactions as you authorized. '' Had I known I was being scammed, I would have NEVER authorized this, and this was FRAUD by deception, and I find it ominous that Wells Fargo BENEFITS from not only the cash advance fees but has a stake in XXXX as well. Needless to say, I closed my checking and savings with Wells Fargo, and told them I will never do business with them again, and that XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX would be rolling in their graves if they knew about this... but it fell on deaf ears.

461,"There are 3 Credit Ratings Companies ( Top 3 ) all give me a credit score from XXXX to XXXX out of XXXX. Now it is very puzzling when they decide to give someone a credit card, why they fail to use the credit score? Or why they refuse how good this guy credit rating is? 

when I go buy a car, They tell me your credit score is in 5 percentile and very good. 

I have had business both personal and corporate with Wells Fargo BanK long before that started with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NC and then Wachovia Bank, all of these are now within Wells Fargo Bank. So there is a clear knowledge base for the company to make decision. Nothing more important than the Credit Score which clearly show the character of the person getting the credit card. I had never had a returned check through out the 50 years of work experience and never failed to pay my bills, if they were mine, and not paying them ontime. 

The excuse they bring is "" you need to do things to improve your credit score ''. This clearly show the persons who is actually reading and sending out these letters are not highly qualified people. 

The only plausible explanation is the pure prejudice because of my XXXX name, which by itself does not necessarily determine the character of the person. 

I would like to send you the two letters I received from these folks and you would explain how this can be anything else other than prejudice. 

The letters provide details needed, I did not include those details here. 

Please allow me to know how I can send you the letters from Wachovia. 

Sincerely"
462,"Several fraudulent charges were made to my credit card. Wells Fargo contacted me because they noticed it. They did not pay for the charges ( small XXXX and XXXX charges ). They issued me a new credit card. This is all in XX/XX/2022. Then I saw XXXX of the fraudulent charges back on my new account. I contacted them and they said they received 'proof ' from XXXX and I asked for them to send that to me. When I received the tracking number I went to the post office and they gave me the address of where the XXXX business routers were delivered - this is not my address. I call Wells Fargo and they add this to my 'notes '. Unfortunately through all of this I really wonder who added notes and who didn't do a thing. They all read from the same script when talking to me. I have been to Wells Fargo branches and they are unable to help. I filed a police report. When I received the 'proof ' - it was NOT my email address or my XXXX account that was used and I then called back and provided them with this information. I also looked into IP addresses and this one was not mine. 
I did not make this purchase and I am not responsible for the XXXX charge and the interest charges. 
I have spoken to multiple people on the phone and via email. I have had to take time off of work to deal with this and this has caused me a great deal of stress and anxiety. 
I am incredibly distraught and upset and I do not owe Wells Fargo this money."
463,"I observed a {$16.00} payment on my Wells Fargo Visa account for an expressed mailed credit card on XX/XX/XXXX. I called Wells Fargo as soon as I discovered this to inquire about the {$16.00} fee and report that neither my husband or myself, as it is a joint account, requested a new card. We then reviewed our online credit statement and observed a {$100.00} cash advance payment with a {$10.00} advance fee. I then phoned the Well Fargo Fraud Department and spoke with XXXX at which time I was instructed by him to report to a Wells Fargo branch bank in person with photo ID 's and that a "" hold '' would be placed on the credit card. Also, I was informed that our address of 22 years had been changed to a XXXX XXXX area on the Wells Fargo credit card account. The agent cancelled the compromised card and I requested a new credit card to be mailed ( not express mailed ). Upon further investigation on our part we discovered more {$100.00} cash advance withdrawals with a {$10.00} cash advance service fee. We reported to a Wells Fargo branch bank at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, FL., and spoke with banker XXXX XXXX who in return made phone calls to their fraud department to report this issue. We received a credit for 5 fraudulent transactions with the {$10.00} service fee. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, we observed that our credit card balance was {$290.00}, the next morning the balance increased to {$840.00} without us making any charges. Again, we went back to the same Wells Fargo branch and spoke with banker XXXX XXXX, who made calls to inquire about the sudden increase in the balance. She indicated that Wells Fargo added the five {$100.00} payments back to our account. We again reported fraudulent use of our credit card which then amounted to ten {$100.00} cash withdrawals and the additional {$10.00} service fees for each transaction. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo again and spoke with XXXX ( correct spelling of name ), who reported that the first claim was denied and that the second claimed was dated XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, My husband and I spoke with the branch manager, XXXX XXXX, and banker XXXX XXXX at Wells Fargo, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. After numerous phone calls, they indicated that they requested an additional "" elevated '' investigation and that we would get the results via phone in 24 to 48 hours On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo and spoke with XXXX with customer service who transferred me to XXXX, a specialist in the fraud department and credit card claims, XXXX reported that no "" elevated "" investigation was requested and that a reconsideration was recorded on XX/XX/XXXX. I received a correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX regarding the resolution of the dispute indicating that Wells Fargo conducted a research on the claim which resulted in no fraud found because the transaction was made using my credit card pin. Because your card and pin was in your possession at the time of the transaction, we have concluded that the charge is valid. Any temporary credit your card may have received will be reversed and the amount will be reapplied to your balance. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX of customer service, to inquire about the pin number the perpetrator used to gain access to my credit card account. She stated that pin numbers are confidential however, she confirmed to me that the pin number was changed on XX/XX/XXXX by an unidentified person portraying themselves as me. I did not make a request for a change in pin number. At this time, the total amount loss is {$1100.00} with all charges coming from the XXXX XXXX area. 
We have been a customer of the Wells Fargo credit card since XXXX. We have resided at same address since XX/XX/XXXX. According to the evidence, we have never been to where the address was change ; we did not request the address change, the rapid charges that occurred are not historical patterns of credit expenditures and we have no knowledge of receiving a pin number for our credit card pin, nor have we ever used the pin number for cash advances. All factors are indicative of fraudulent exploitation. Me and my spouse are an elderly couple with compromised health. Our resources and savings are a livelihood and we have exhausted ourselves with this unauthorized use of our funds. We have been overwhelmed with the effort to provide evidence and advocacy. We expect this matter to be resolved immediately and that our account to be credited for the fraudulent charges and fees in the amount of {$1100.00}. 
Documents can be provided upon request."
465,"There was a balance of under {$6.00}. We attempted to call to make a payment but ivr indicated that there was not balance. Have escalated the issue multiple times because the account has now been closed without notice. After speaking to multiple people about their system not being synced, I was told that they could not talk to me if I did not submit a document as my Fathers agent. This account has been active since 2003."
466,"I applied for a credit card at Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. A week later I received a letter declining my application with a FICO score of XXXX out of 850, an almost perfect credit score. 

My application was denied due to my XXXX last name. If my last name was of a XXXX person, my application would have been immediately approved based on my credit profile. It makes absolutely no sense why my application was declined based on my almost perfect credit score and annual household income of $ XXXX. I was never contacted to substantiate my income or any of their concerns. 

After receiving the letter, thinking it was a mistake based on my over 20 years of immaculate credit history and an household income of $ XXXX, I contacted Wells Fargo to get more information. I was able to speak with their executive office representative and escalated my case. I offered to provide my tax returns and current pay stubs to substantiate my income and to mitigate any risk concerns the credit card analyst had. Additionally, I expressed my concerns that I was a victim of XXXX discrimination due to my last name. 

A week after speaking with the executive office, I received the same exact letter, almost verbatim from the previous letter which means no one in the executive office did anything. I am a victim of XXXX discrimination. I have a long established immaculate credit history with an almost perfect credit score. The only deviation is my last name. The analyst and manager that worked on my application are XXXX  and proper action needs to be taken."
467,"For several months I stopped receiving statements from my Wells Fargo credit card. Then in XXXX, I received a statement that was forwarded from another address in Texas. On the statement were two charges on XXXX XXXX in the amount of XXXX and XXXX from a XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX. I have not been to XXXX XXXX in several years. I called Wells Fargo on XXXX XXXX who put me through a rigors process of proving my identity and canceling the account. They reissued a new card, but I refused to activate unless these charges were reversed. After receiving other statements still showing a overdrawn balance with fees, and being notified that my credit score dropped to the lower 600s, I contacted Wells Fargo again on XXXX. I was told that the fraud complaint was closed and no fraudulent charges were ever identified. The representative said he would try to reopen the investigation but could not promise anything. After all of the news about the corruption within Well Fargo, I  want to see if filing a complaint with CFPB would be of any help."
469,"On XXXX XXXX, 2017 I made a payment online with my Wells Fargo mobile app to my secured card. I made this payment mid morning Eastern standard Time on the Friday. Wells Fargo states that payments made before midnight Pacific time will post to the account the date made ( paraphrase ). I called on XXXX XXXX, 2017 at XXXX XXXX to see why my payment was n't posted and they told me that it was n't there and I had to wait for their system to update in 1 to 3 business days. There system never shows the pending payment but shows it in posted so they do n't allow them to push the payment through. This causes delays in using my card."
474,"We had a balance of {$660.00}. We accidentally made two payments totaling {$1000.00}, which was over the balance owed. We noticed immediately and were unable to cancel the payment online. We called and they told us they would issue the overage ( {$330.00} ) back to our bank account in 7-14 days. They next day, they charged us {$160.00}, which was our previously scheduled monthly payment ( account was paid off, we shouldn't have been charged anything after that and they said that we would not, now that our account was paid in full. ) We contacted them again and were told that they were so sorry and now they owed us {$500.00} within the next 7-14 days. ) After that time frame passed and we did not receive the funds back, we contacted them again, they apologized and said it would actually be up to 45 days and the previous reps didn't know what they were talking about. They said we would receive the {$500.00} back by XX/XX/XXXX at the latest. We confirmed - AGAIN, that no more funds would be taken out and that we would receive the funds back by XX/XX/XXXX. They assured us 100 %. In the meantime, they took out another payment of {$160.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. This brought the total owed to us from Wells Fargo to $ XXXX.We contacted them immediately and they apologized profusely and said they would "" rush '' the refund on the XX/XX/XXXX payment and we would receive it in a few days. We did not. This time we waited for XX/XX/XXXX to roll around. When we did not receive anything back from Wells Fargo, we contacted them on XX/XX/XXXX. They apologized again and said that everyone else we spoke with previously was wrong and it could actually be 60 days before we would receive anything back. They did not know or have the ability to answer why they were continuing to charge us even though we had satisfied the total account balance ( + {$660.00} ). They  continue to debit money while lying about when we will receive our refund. We are now 48 days out from the original complaint and have still haven't received any refunds of the money they have taken from us after our account was satisfied and without our consent."
475,"This kind of account is placed as a charged off account, be sure to inform me precisely why there's a balance indicating on the document whether it's a charge off? The balance is, in fact, wrong, please make sure to reverse it to XXXX or remove the item fully. Please also produce documentation to verify all the charges and credits in this supposed account that caused to the extremely high credit figure you might have displayed on my account. My demand to present these records is a standard information demand in accordance with my rights honored within the fair credit billing act. If you fail to give these details per my civil rights petition, please make sure you quickly remove this specific wrong posting."
478,"Wells Fargo is attempting to collect on a debt, that's charged off. This account was discharged and the alleged debt has been used as a tax write-off. This will be an act of tax fraud, to collect on a debt that is registered as income. The harassment to collect on this debt would be a violation of the FCRA 15 USC 1681eb, failing to report information that is accurate."
480,"In early XXXX, my daughter called me and told me that my ex-husband had left and was not picking up his phone. I went and picked her up and we tried to find him. At that point, we received a XXXX  ' note from him. In the note, he claimed that he had taken a loan out in my son 's name. We immediately filed both a missing person 's report with XXXX XXXX PD and a police report for identity theft against my ex-husband with XXXX XXXX, AZ PD. My son and I promptly checked our credit reports. My son found a loan for XXXX dollars from XXXX XXXX, and I found several credit cards under my name that were maxed out that I never knew about, and he neglected to mention when we divorced. I cancelled as many of the cards as I could ( because I was only an Authorized User ), but two of the companies ( XXXX and Wells Fargo ) have refused to even contact the police officer assigned to the case. XXXX XXXX, on the other hand, has cleared the loan from my son 's name, and they stayed in communication with the officer on the case. We have tried repeatedly to contact Wells Fargo by phone and by mail in particular, but they keep sending card statements and asking for payments when the police officer has told us repeatedly that Wells Fargo has never even approached him.

We have the credit card information, police report number, police report, and the Officer 's Contact Info and we can provide all of this information upon request. We've provided all of this to the companies that are mentioned. 

I haven't attached these documents for privacy concerns."

I got XXXX fraud warnings XXXX from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX from XXXX XXXX Bank on XX/XX/XXXX. I am the only authorized user and only have XXXX debit card with Wells Fargo. I immediately answered XXXX and in error accepted as non fraudulent ( it was XXXX am and there were a number of charges. Upon review I immediately read the charges again and noticed XXXX that was for GAS ( no amount ) and realized that this was not an auto pay. I tried to Iogin into my Wells account and could not get my SMS text after 3 tries. After I logged in with my email getting the authorization code and found the charges were for XXXX at a Gas station in Florida. That is when I logged into XXXX and noticed a different phone next to my tele number and a XXXX line added. I immediately notified the fraud unit of Wells Fargo XX/XX/XXXX at approx. XXXX and was given a Claim Number and was told to destroy my card and a new card will be issued XXXX Days. The XXXX charge from XXXX on my XXXX XXXX Bank I sent back as Fraudulent ( {$2300.00} ) which originated in FL also. I Notified XXXX of the fraud and they reinstalled the correct SIM on both of my numbers and deleted the XXXX fraudulently added line. Wells sends me letter XXXX that they have denied my claim due to fact that card was tapped? I have NEVER tapped a card in my life, asked them to check my account and asked them to send me a store video of me in FL. They stated to me ( A female named XXXX ) that you can not hack the chip and I must of given my card to someone?? I have since read about the XXXX XXXX that occurred XX/XX/XXXX ( was never notified ) and internet posts on how a fraud can occur with a tapped transaction. Wells is sending me the documents ( who knows which ones ) but it appears they will recharge my account for the fraudulent charges. What does a consumer do?"

Send me proof in writing what did I want you to do with this account? You been reporting it as false since the account went close that erroneous information because you were to lazy to actual conduct a proper investigation is what this is all about.

485,"I recently discovered that Wells Fargo has been charging me a XXXX dollar annual fee for a credit card for the past XXXX years. I went into a branch to ask about it and they told me in the branch that there should not be a fee. They told me I would have to call customer service and talk to them. I called and spent an hour and twenty five minutes on the phone with them. They told me yes, there is no fee but we can only reimburse you for last year. Not the other years that they stole from me. 

I asked "" Wasn't Wells Fargo recently fined by the government for stealing money from their customers through credit card fees, etc. '' That got their attention and the person I was speaking with passed me over to someone else. That person spent 20 minutes trying to locate a original agreement between the bank and I regarding fees but could not find it. I then reminded them to just look on their website where you advertise this very card - it says there are no fees. She then gave me an 18 digit case number and said someone will call me someday. I have no faith that they will act accordingly."
487,"From the year XXXX to XXXX a former bookkeeper for the business was fraudulently using a business credit card to make purchases from XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, etc. to the amount of {$23000.00} This was not recognized until she was already fired for payroll theft and we were going back through the records. It was hard to differentiate our XXXX purchases from her XXXX purchases so we decided to call XXXX to verify. We were able to get a XXXX on the phone and she was able to help us go through the many transactions that were there and let us know which ones were fraudulent and which ones weren't. I spent no less than XXXXXXXX XXXX  on the phone with this particular XXXX going through each individual charge, what it was and who made the charge. She was also able to let us know that this bookkeeper had XXXX credit cards linked to her XXXX account that did not belong to her. After we discovered the XXXX fraud we then noticed that there was fraud by XXXX XXXX. We also have XXXX XXXX for our business and when we went back and looked we were being charged XXXX every XXXX by XXXX. Once for our cell phones and once for the bookkeepers entire family cell phones. This was not just her phone, but everyone in her family. Once we had gathered our information we immediately notified the police and Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo rejected the fraud because she was a bookkeeper for the company. We never gave her the credit card to use and she never had it in her possession. We do not know how she was able to obtain the number. Once Wells Fargo denied the claim we had our attorney send them a letter with more information. He also called Wells Fargo to try and resolve this to no avail. The bookkeeper has since been XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for these credit card charges but we still have not received any help whatsoever from Wells Fargo other than for them to tell us that they denied the claim. We would appreciated any help that we can get. This process has been prolonged due to XXXX and the court system being backed up."

I am personally going through a lot right now from this virus so my mind has been in a blur as I have buried a family member yesterday. 

Last night, after falling asleep from exhaustion, I freaked out and realized it was XX/XX/XXXX. I called the Automated Phone system and submitted a payment for remainder of the balance without the interest ( what I should have owed before the terms expired ). However, on XXXX, WF already added in the {$980.00} in interest to my account. The automation system said since I paid before XXXX XXXX  PCT it will post on XXXX. Please just know I am very responsible with my bills its just been a bad month. I am not accepting this."

I checked my bank account where the payment was taken from and I saw that my balance was a negative amount. Wells Fargo had taken a non-authorized payment of {$3000.00}. I immediately called Wells Fargo Credit Card and they informed me that there was nothing they could do until after mid-night on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called back on XX/XX/XXXX am time, and I was informed by the Credit Card Department that the reversal on my account would take 2 business days. 

I called am on XX/XX/XXXX to follow up and was informed that it would take 11 business days for the bank to return my funds to my bank account. I informed the person I spoke with that this was not acceptable and demanded to speak with a manager. 

I was then transferred to Wells Fargo Compliance Department who informed me that all she could do was file a complaint against the misinformation. I demanded that this matter be escalated and I was then informed that an executive from Wells Fargo would call me. I have not heard back."
492,A fraudulent charge was made on my Wells Fargo account by XXXX for the amount of {$15.00} on XX/XX/2022 and again on XX/XX/2022. I disputed both charges and requested a new credit card. I have since received my new card ( have not activated it ) and today I received another message stating there is a charge from XXXX in the amount of {$15.00}. I contacted Wells Fargo and I asked to close my credit card account and disputed the charge. I was given the run around when I asked to go ahead and close the credit card account. The first 2 disputes are still in process. I have asked for an update and was not given one and told to call back when the claims department is open. I don't use this credit card at all my XXXX account is linked to a different credit card.

He has had my card for the last week and he wont stop trying to XXXX up my credit even after I pay something off he went and spent money again today XX/XX/2022 and I want to dispute every transaction he has made since last week.
499,"Wells Fargo created a fake credit card in my name. I was never notified about this until they started piling fees onto the card, closed the account after the amount owed was about {$100.00} over the spending limit for the card, and sent it to collections, at which point I started getting phone calls. Since then, I was given a settlement check in the class-action lawsuit about this issue, but the account still shows up on my credit report. I tried disputing it with the credit agencies multiple times to no avail, and then with Wells Fargo themselves, and it is STILL on my credit report - it looks like they actually reopened it and reclosed it due to my complaint, which will keep it on my credit report for another 7 years, even though I never applied for a credit card, never received one, and never signed anything, AND the company recognized their actions against me as unlawful ( I received a settlement check )."
501,"I submitted a complaint to Wells Fargo bank regarding a dispute about an airline ticket in which XXXX  XXXX refuses to resolve an issue with me in regards to a cancelled flight. I was unable to use the ticket because of the stay at home order due to COVID-19  so I wanted to get a refund or a credit with XXXX  XXXX. I was unable to reach them through email and through phone so I initiated a dispute with my bank. When I initiated the dispute with my bank XXXX XXXX  removed my itinerary completely and there was no record of the flight whatsoever in my name. Wells Fargo ended up siding with XXXX  XXXX  after the dispute because of the fact that they "" offered me a resolution '' when in fact they did not. Their policy states that they will be giving credits to all customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic when in fact they did not honor that."
502,"I was notified by the credit card company that the XXXX credit card will be closed if do not charge {$1000.00}. I didnt and was issue a Rewards credit card. When I changed on the new card for the first time and sent the payment to the same po box that I have used since 2014, it didnt get processed and to this day it is unknown what happened to it. I was never notified of a payment address change nor if the address change had anything to do with going from XXXX to a Rewards card. 

I called the credit card company regarding the issue informing them of the payment and asking for address verification several times but there was silence. I was given a fax number to fax proof of payment to, which I did. I never heard back from them. During the first call I told them without address verification I will be blindly re-sending the payment and my next payment as well. Again nothing said. 
I canceled the first payment then resent it and the next payment to the same address hoping that the first payment had only got lost in the mail. The resent payment disappeared and the next payment was sent back to my bank. Wells Fargo was sent proof of payments but refused to accept them stating they want my bank account statements. No, no one looks at my bank account statement but me and the shredder. I feel wanting access to my bank statements is a major invasion of privacy. It would tell them who I work for, how much I get paid, where I shop, where I like to eat, who I pay my bills too and much more. That is way more than they need to know for proof of payment. 

I made two calls to them with the first one wanting the address verification, I got it on the second call. I went to Wells Fargo and made the payments to make sure there would no more issues. They gave me the number to call and make a formal complaint which I did. Next I responded to the investigation results from the formal complaint call."
505,"I've had a Wells Fargo credit card for almost two years, always made my payments on time and never had any issues. A couple of days I received a message saying that they increased my credit limit to {$4000.00}, but the next day after they raised my credit limit my account was closed without any reason, I call the bank and they said I was going to receive a letter explaining why. I received the letter today and it did not explained anything, so I have no clue why they just all fo the sudden close my account."
507,"I am a victim of unfair credit reporting and deceptive practices. I have made several attempts to resolve the matter. XX/XX/2020 I filed a dispute with XXXX XXXX Credit Bureau stating that I was not the owner of the closed credit card on my credit report. I requested to see a contract agreement with my signature along with any monthly statements sent to me. XXXX XXXX is the only credit bureau reporting on this alleged credit card account and they indicated the account is closed. XX/XX/2020, Wells Fargo reported to the credit bureau that the limit on the close account had been lowered {$73.00}. As a result of the report from Wells Fargo, XXXX XXXX credit bureau lowered my credit score XXXX  points. I have disputed the ownership of this account because the credit card in question that I held with Wells Fargo was a {$1000.00} SECURED Credit Card and no such amount was charged to this card. Also the credit bureau investigation failed to resolve anything. There was no evidence surrendered to suggest that I owned the account.."
508,"On XX/XX/XXXX a merchant, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, double charged me for services. I called Well Fargo to dispute the second charge. After Wells Fargos investigation, they determined that my dispute claim is denied. After the denial, I call Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX to get a better understanding of the claim denial. In turn, the supplied with a new credit card I did not ask for and ultimately never resolved my claim."
510,"I had a charge of {XXXX} dollars that I disputed I believe XX/XX/21 or around that time.Wellsfargo detected fraud and I called and confirmed that it was indeed an unauthorized purchase. Today ( XX/XX/21 ) I look on my account and see I have a outstanding balance of {$XXXXXXXX} and a notice on my app that says I am over my credit card limit. I call Wellsfargo and they inform me that my claim was denied because of the ip Address of purchase matched my normal IP address ( something like that ). Basically what I got out of that was that my claim was denied because they believe I authorized the purchase. At this point Im upset because Im informing the rep that I didnt authorize any purchase and she then ask me did I receive any merchandise from the merchant I told her no, how could I receive anything when I have no idea about this purchase, I DID NOT AUTHORIZE ANY PURCHASE. she tried to contact the fraud department but they do not work weekends I guess. I ask here is there anything that could be done to get this resolved to day. She said not and advised I have to call back in Monday so that I can speak fo the fraud department and possible get the merchant involved. she also advised that since the claim was denied, I could try to file the claim again but it couldnt be for the reason of fraud which sounds crazy because I told her numerous times that I dont have no idea about this unauthorized purchase. So at this point Im highly upset and I need my money back."

I am aware that pursuant to 15 USC 1605 ( a ) a finance charge is the sum of all charges.

You can ask the credit bureaus that I paid off all of my collection agencies. It is sad that Wells Fargo is treating me like this. 

They know that most people don't look at their credit report. 

They said that they will submit it to fraud department. 
I asked them what address is on the application, they said my current address is on there. I told them that I never applied for a card in Mississippi in XXXX. 

They said that they will send me the application and other stuff for validation ... and they never did mail them to me. 

I disputed with XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, KS XXXX and I do not know who they are. They never responded to me, it has been over 30 days. Their trade name XXXX and XXXX XXXX, I have never borrow money from them or applied to them. 

I disputed this on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, DE XXXX and they didn't respond to me at all. I asked them to remove themselves off of my credit report. Since they didn't send me any validation. 

I disputed this on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, ND XXXX and I have not heard from them either. They didn't send me any validation. I don't remember them. 

I attached document of transcript conversation between me and Wells Fargo ... using TTY."

I filed a fraud report with local XXXX Sherrif 's police department reporting the fraud that was made on the card. I also filed a report to Wells Fargo, and tried to resolve this issue without a resolution at the time that I am filing this complain against them. I have excellent credit, and this transaction is having an impact on my credit score. 

I have a file to send to you, I am not able to submit all of the documents here online. I have over 40 pages of documents. 

I need an immediate resolution, as I been trying to resolve this issue for almost a year now. I even contacted the State Attorney 's General 's Office, and could not reach a resolution there either."

I immediately pulled a copy of my report on XXXX the only thing in my report is this under the special messages section "" INPUT SSN LIKELY NOT ISSUED PRIOR TO XX/XX/XXXX '' this is because I became officially a legal resident of the USA as of XX/XX/XXXX, the problem that I am having with this company is because my wife who is a citizen of the United States share same accounts in our credit report and to my surprise she applied the same day as me and she was approved immediately even though our credit history is similar due to our joint lines of credit, I have excellent credit 0 negatives remarks and no fraud alerts for them to state "" they need to confirm my identity '' and that I can't even provide them my information to validate my identity I feel discriminated, I only have one address and that is my current, I looked at phone numbers it only contains my wife 's and my cellphone number I feel this is credit discrimination due to being qualified for the credit card my score is XXXX and no real explanation has been provided to my person.

521,"On or about XX/XX/2022, someone who stole my identify applied for credit with Wells Fargo. 

I received a letter in the mail from Wells Fargo denying the application, but I have a hard inquiry on my reports now and also a denial of credit."
522,"On   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX     I had a repair service billed to my credit card for {$310.00}, in which I made a payment on  XXXX  of {$53.00}. I did not see another bill until the end of  XXXX  (  XX/XX/XXXX statement ). I noticed a {$27.00} late fee and did n't understand why. I called  Well Fargo o n   XX/XX/XXXX a bout the bill and was informed that I had a bill (  XXXX   )  prior to the bill I had received. After a few minutes of discussing the missing bill, the  CSR indic ated that she would waived  XXXX  credit  XXXX  the charge as a courtesy on  XXXX  and sent me a copy of the missing bill for my records. Since the payment was {$80.00}, I sent in the differ ence ( {$53.00} )  on  XXXX  to complete paying the amount due. On the next bi ll (  XX/XX/XXXX  ), I now  see a {$37.00} late fee. I am confused again since I have been making multiple payments on my card. So I called again on XX/XX/XXXX  to inquire what was going on and I was told that the credit was not applied against what I had to pay but against the balance. I argued that that was n't what I was told and that in the conversation, the  CSR di d not indicate that I still had to paid {$80.00}. The CSR I was talking with would not remove the charge because they had remove the prior late fee. I asked to talk with a supervisor and while I can not remember whether it occurred in that conversation or whether the supervisor call back, I was able to talk to a supervisor and explain my case, emphasising that if I had received the missing bill, the first late fee would not had occurred AND that I was n't aware and I was n't told that the waived fee would n't count as a payment, I should n't be penalized for the  CSR not being clear and I do n't work at the bank so my understanding of amount be credited to my account and Well Fargo ( seem ) to   be different. The supervisor indicated that the fee would be waived but the credit  may not show up for up to 2 cycl es. I continued to make payments and paid off the amount owed. When I did n't see the problem corrected, I called back on  XXXX  and was back at square  one. I do n't have a problem with the bank making money but not by taking advantage of the customer. This has now seriously affected my credit score and other credit accounts.   <P/> I can see if I was acting in bad faith, but I tried to be proactive in handling issues with my accounts."
523,"On XXXX/XXXX/22, I booked a hotel room for an event that immediately sells out all affiliated hotel rooms. I had the credit card in question saved to my XXXX account. Per Wells Fargo, an initial test charge was approved, but the deposit payment was declined. According to Wells Fargo, this was declined due to fraud protection. I had received a text to verify the payment, which I had responded to within XXXX minute while I was at work. Unfortunately, due to the nature of this event, the hotel room was immediately cancelled due to declined payment, and rebooked to someone else immediately ( there is no waitlist ). The trip itself may be ruined, as I am now scrambling to find a less desirable hotel room that will be more expensive due to not being part of the event. It's difficult to predict how much money I will lose due to having to find new accommodations. 

XX/XX/22 : Complaint called into Wells Fargo XX/XX/22 : Email received stating XXXX ( ext XXXX ) is handling this case. I called the extension, but XXXX was out of the office. I requested a rep call put in a message to call me back, as potentially rebooking the room is extremely time sensitive. 
XX/XX/22 : I called again, and was informed that XXXX is out of the office. I requested a call back from someone else on the team. The rep I spoke with forwarded my concerns to team leader, XXXX XXXX, and the team manager, XXXX XXXX XXXX did not receive any calls from this team. 
XX/XX/22 : XXXX called me in the morning, and said that she is escalating my case. She acknowledged all of my stated concerns, and did all that she could in requesting resolution, and upon being rejected for those resolutions, escalating the case further. The case was escalated to XXXX XXXX ext XXXX ), who told me that she was ready to close the case with no resolution. She stated that Wells Fargo does not guarantee payment on claims, and they would not do anything to assist in the situation generated by their declined payment. I requested to escalate further, and XXXX refused, stating that she is the highest escalation. I asked if she was the manager of her department, and she stated that she is not, so I asked to speak to a manager. She said that a manager from a different site may call back, but her manager is XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo declines payment, refuses to elaborate on why fraud protection was triggered and why they choose to auto-deny payment instead of verifying before rescinding payment. Declined payment cancels my hotel room, which is possibly now irretrievable. Wells Fargo refuses to help, and my trip is potentially ruined, and I likely will have to spend even more money for less desirable accommodations, if any in the area are even available. 

The heart of my complaint : Wells Fargo automatically denying claims on a credit card, for a hotel room, is anti-consumer. I would expect that a future booking for a hotel room would be particularly easy to recoup a payment, considering in most instances if it happened before or during the stay, the hotel would be able to cancel the reservation or update payment method. By automatically denying payments as part of the fraud protection system that Wells Fargo has chosen to use, it puts the burden on the customer to fix a mistake made by Wells Fargo. Notably, other banks and credit card providers do not automatically deny payments, even when a verification request is sent to the customer."
524,"Wells Fargo Visa. I have on repeated occasions, at least four, over the last several weeks attempted to get copies of my monthly statements for XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. These statements are not available online. 

Wells Fargo has promised me they will mail the statements and fax them to me but they never arrive. Each time they say to give them 3 days to arrive via fax but they don't arrive. We even tried working through our local Wells Fargo branch and they called on our behalf and even provided their fax number to their credit card department but also to no avail. 

Thank you for any help you can provide. We have run out of options to try to work with them to get us the information we have requested."
525,"Hello, My name is XXXX XXXX and Im writing this letter regarding a scam transaction through a wells Fargo credit card. 
Last year on XX/XX/2022 I purchased a 1st class upgrade ticket from XXXX to XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX through a wells Fargo credit card. 
after paying the {$1100.00} I didn't see the upgrade on the app so I called XXXX XXXX to make sure everything went through and the representative told me the upgrade will show shortly as a business class in the connection flight from XXXX XXXX to XXXX, so I informed the representative that this not was shown on the notification on the app it should be first class for the whole flight and he can review the phone call I made to them before purchasing to go over the details, the representative ignored me then I called wells customer service and informed them what happened and they told me they cant do anything at the moment, since the transaction still pending and they will dispute it when it's processed. 
After 10 days I had to travel and the airlines forced me to get in business class in the connection and the bank dispute the amount in XXXX and charged it back in XX/XX/2022 and since then wells refused to dispute it again saying that the merchant provided proof of using the service and ignored that I informed them it was a scam after 15 min from the purchase and 10 days from the travel date. 
Below is some supporting Info : Case # XXXX Account # XXXX Thanks, XXXX"
526,"I sent this to their executives, after calling and emailing as well, but they sent a manual bounce back ( without any real bounce attached ). They were NOT authorized to run my credit either. I am VERY CONCERNED MY INFORMATION HAS BEEN COMPROMISED!!! 

To the WF account executives, My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX, though your customer service employees kept calling me "" XXXX XXXX '' on the phone as they were powerless to help me. 

I'd just decided to lease a condo part time. My permanent address is the same one links to my SS # and my XXXX ( depending on which agency you ask ) credit score. I am single -- by technical definitions, I am a literal orphan. I have no one on this earth. I was raised poor. By poor, I mean POOR. I mean, I remember having a nickel to last a WEEK. Surely you understand WHY having worked HARD for an XXXX credit score is a big deal. Now thanks to the ineptitude of WF, my credit score will fall for two years, all because of a credit check I did not actually authorize. You WILL remove this, and I will fight this up to every level possible. It may only be a few points, but I fought hard to get where I am, and I am not going backwards.

I teach for a major university. I teach remotely, but found leasing a condo was cheaper than the hotel I live in now. But my permanent address is still the one linked to all my credit cards. I have myriad cards -- none with a late payment. XXXX, XXXX, you name it. Annual fees, I pay them. But as a traveler, 50 states, 5 continents and counting, I decided to listen to XXXX XXXX and his buddies and pay my rent with the BILT REWARDS card. My nightmare began. 

All was good until WF wanted to text me twice as I was beginning my application process. The first time was at my current number, which is on my credit report. I verified it. All was well. But then it asked to send me a security code at my number ending in XXXX to complete my application BEFORE CHECKING MY CREDIT. I recognized that -- VAGUELY. I may have been in grad school 20 or 30 years ago when I had that XXXX flip phone, back when texting was {$.00} a minute? Are you kidding me right now? 

That's when my nightmare with WF began. By now you maybe know the end. I have initiated a consumer credit complaint against you. I can't tell if someone on the XXXX end stole my information, or if someone at WF is clueless or what. Two phone calls and three emails later -- note that NO ONE EVER sent ME and email after my application-- and all I could find was I was supposed to MAIL my secure documents through US mail ( NOT SECURE! ) which included utility bills?

All the proof in the world I am me, and WF is so antiquated they don't have secure portals for these things? I don't feel safe with such protocols anyway, but I haven't even moved in, and my permanent address is with an old mentor of mine. SHE PAYS HER UTILITIES. I live in a hotel when I am in the city of the university. This is not XXXX XXXX. 

By then I began to wonder who was online when I submitted my secure information. I think someone was messing with it. No one could help. Lots of apologies, but no answers. I feel very UNSAFE, very lied to. And the worst part is that you already checked my credit before I could get that far. I was saying that IF THE PROCESS CONTINUED YOU COULD, but I hit CANCEL. I specifically hit the word CANCEL IN THE PROCESS WHEN I SAW YOU WANTED TO VERIFY AN OLD PHONE NUMBER. But you went ahead and did a hard inquiry on my credit report. 

I take issue with this and insist it be removed or I will consider this either fraud on the part of whomever was taking action, or perhaps even actionable behavior as this was genuinely the shadiest thing I have ever had in 20+ years of credit and professional life. 

That's like an inoculation with the wrong medication -- you can't take it out. So my credit report now looks like I was rejected for a card for which I was WORTHY. I chose YOU over a different Chase card which I would not be able to get now due to their rules, but after the trauma and possible FRAUD I went through with WF, now I don't have the BILT REWARDS card either and my credit score will fall a few points.

All I have is my good name and credit. My student loans are THROUGH THE ROOF, and being paid off through Public Service Loan Forgiveness, every painstaking month, since I was on my own going through school. In this world, I may have e a PhD but I am still no one. I did not need Walls Fargo and XXXX XXXX to REMIND me of this. 

I will file a fraud dispute against the inquiry, but I would like you to address this and even remove it. This was a horribly traumatic experience. I started my life with bad credit and barely knowing how interest worked and messing everything up. Now I am three years away from my student loans being forgiven, and not having any real debt in the world. And I just got treated like the biggest loser ever.

Someone at WF is either stealing info or doesn't know basic security protocol. Or both.

I am NOT in the habit of emailing every executive in a company but I am both beginning my new position Monday and moving into my part time condo I can not now NOT use BILT REWARDS to pay for because someone wants me to perpetuate fraud and MAIL my government documents to you in the most insecure way that exists. I wouldnt send a baptism certificate through the US mail. Further, I CANCELED my authorization, and you checked my credit anyway, but That is what I would expect from a site with such weak security you think my phone number ends with XXXX and XXXX cant remember what level of grad school I was in when I had that number. 

This is my singular notice and request I will CC to credit bureaus, CFPB, XXXX XXXX XXXX the XXXX  as a request you remove your inquiry from my credit report, and remove ALL RECORDS of my former business with you. What a horrific mistake I made even considering trying XXXX. I look forward to other companies competing with you. Anyone else would be a solid winner. I have literally had to call my union legal counsel to see how to proceed, but have been informed for me a letter to you with this information may be sufficient, and, thus, I trust they are correct and you will show some integrity and I will receive notices from my credit bureaus saying items were removed from my report. 

I also request you investigate this incident. This was at best a security breach, and at worst, fraud on behalf of someone working when I began the process and pulled out when I saw the wrong phone number. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Please do not try any technicalities on me with buttons embedded on your website. The old phone number issue and my pushing cancel, and the fact your employees then told me BOTH my current phone numbers were unable to text me when you already had both prove your website was not accurately working. So even if you try saying I authorized anything, I did not. To my knowledge, I pushed CANCEL and you checked my credit anyway. I will argue the technical aspect all the way to court if I must."
527,"While heading out for a vacation on XXXX Wells Fargo called and said they was an issue with my credit card. Since I had not used that card in months I said you're calling the wrong person. The woman replied please call the number on the back of your card. I called and was told a person from a New York phone number had called to get the balance of my account. She said it wasn't anything to worry about and said they would send a replacement card to my XXXX XXXX XXXX She had me establish a pin number in case someone called in again. 
On XXXX I received another call stating they were from the fraud dept. I called the number on the back of my card and was told they sent a card to a NY address. I live in another state. I told them to close my account. I asked why they did not use the pin number established. When I called back they did not use it with me either. 
On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  when I returned from vacation I received a text that 2 charges were made at XXXX {$1000.00} and {$1300.00} from account ending in XXXX. I called the back of my card and they said there were no charges. I read the text to the person who then she found the account! It was reported as fraud I asked the account to be closed as I did not open it. 
I discovered after going into the bank on XX/XX/XXXX that 3 accounts were opened. Meanwhile I was getting emails of other accounts .... a total of 5 have been opened as of XXXX. 
I have spent COUNTLESS hours trying to get them to stop issuing cards in my name to close all accounts!! One day they closed one and reopened it, after reading to me that it couldn't be reopened. When I asked why it was reopened the guy said well sometimes we do under certain circumstances!! WHAT circumstance? Theres notes of fraud all over my account!!! Then he proceeds to read me the same policy that the account cant be reopened. So they sent another one to NY. 
I have contacted the attorneys that had a previous class action against them. They say I have a law suit to file. 
Yesterday they said I have to go back to the branch again to close accounts. The branch manager identified me, then I had to call them again to close an account. I have been repeatedly told the account was being investigated ... .. and transferred to other departments. Emails have been sent to me with investigations on accounts that I don't have or that weren't sent to NY either. 
Today I received an email they want me to open a checking account with them and they will give me {$350.00}. 
I am a victim of the banks stupidity. 
I am sure this is an inside job, as I have no other issues elsewhere. 
All my family and friends have pulled their money out there. 
When I call them they send me to the fraud department to be verified with a text to my only phone I've had since I opened the account years ago. Why did they not do that with the fake person, who supposedly has my personal info?"
529,"Currently I have has a business account with Wells Fargo for an LLC since XXXX. This has a business credit card with a credit line of {$25000.00}. All balances have been paid in full monthly since this account was opened. Opened a second LLC partnership in XXXX, XXXX. A second business account was opened at Wells Fargo. A business card application was submitted and denied credit on XX/XX/XXXX. A credit line was requested for {$50000.00}. A complaint was lodged with no success and intervention by local bank manager. Even approving {$25000.00} would have worked. No interface with their credit card department only clerk level as their system is designed. Denial reason was, "" your business has not been established long enough to meet program requirements ''. Very interesting with a XXXX credit score and assets of over {>= $1,000,000} and NO debt. Also noteworthy is I'm a XXXX veteran, XXXX XXXX XXXX and my partner is an XXXX. I know many others who have easily gotten such a credit card. Additionally, my treatment changed after I made numerous complaints XXXX timeframe about Wells Fargo regarding denial of a PPP loan which was in contravention of the legislation. With Congressional help, this was approved another bank quickly. No admission of wrongdoing was forth coming by Wells Fargo Senior level executives. Actually got 6 denial letters from them. The scenario has all the appearance of flagrant discrimination by Wells Fargo and I want this investigated."
530,"I have disputed several transactions on my card- some were credited others have not been credited. I last reported a charge for XXXX over the phone, I never received a letter stating that it was being investigated and Wells Fargo won't allow me to check older transactions that may still be fraud. I have paid my account in full to avoid the interest charges for charges that are not mine. I have never allowed my account to be delinquent, but Wells Fargo has not done their absolute best to protect me and I'm not sure how many other fraudulent charges I've paid by mistake."

My case number is XXXX, But after 2 weeks, I still not received my bonus."
534,"Hi, it started when I received checks from Wells Fargo. They offered zero percent interest with these checks for purchases, and balance transfers. Balance transfers had a fee for the transaction. 
So I used a check for a purchase, expecting the zero percent rate. After waiting for the check to go through, I noticed the balance to be higher than I expected. So, after looking at the charges made, I realized they had charged me for a balance transfer. The fee was something like {$120.00} dollars on {$3100.00}. So I called them to inform them that I was charged a balance transfer fee, yet it was a purchase. They told me that if I used the checks they were treated as a balance transfer. I explained that isn't the terms available in the documentation I received with the checks. I was supposed to get zero interest rate on purchases. This is not what occurred. I was charged a flat interest rate right off the bat. So this isn't a zero interest purchase, and they scammed me into using the checks, knowing I can't do anything about the charge. The charge was labeled a balance transfer, which it was not. Wells Fargo is ripping people off again! 
Please help, XXXX XXXX"
535,"I am a XXXX year old, U.S. citizen living for now in XXXX, due to not able to afford living in the U.S. since my pension is only {$600.00} per month. I decided to give my XXXXyear old grand-son, a gift by allowing a purchase pertaining the videogame XXXX for {$9.00} US dollars in XXXX. This was used by using the platform and the credit card informtion was saved there witthout me being aware of it as I had never used my credit card to purchase something related to video games online. My grand-son started making purchases since XX/XX/XXXX, which bills were paid, but continued making purchasing throughout the month of XXXX which amounted to {$4400.00}. Although the purchases were made due to me allowing my grand-son to get that one purchase, what its extremely ackward is that Wells Fargo nor XXXX XXXX did not take any type of action to keep this from happening. I contacted XXXX XXXX and they said charges were valid and that we needed to contact Wells Fargo. We contcted Wells Fargo and they submitted the case for review twice and both times came back with the conclusiong that the charges were valid and that the credit card holder shoudl be liable for the charges, or the person who charged the card should do so, meaning my XXXX year old grad-son. Ridiculous. We have been sent back and forth from one company to the other, where both are abviously looking to find someone else to be responsible for the chages but them. There are many cases already reported on situations like this, and although my son did make the purchases, this was clearly something I was not aware of and did not intend for it to happen. I was a Wells Fargo client since XXXX, and never made those type of purchases nor was ever late on my Credit Card payments and they did not even take any sort of precautions with odd purchases being made by my, specially made from overseas. XXXX XXXX, another company trying to stay away from guilt, knowing there have been cases in which they have had to reimburse families for the same issue, claim charges made by my XXXX year old grand-son were valid, this an under age kid who, although made the purchase, the charges were made by an underage individual so charges could not be valid. Also, I had no idea that the credit card information would stay saved in the platform as it was the first time I used the credit card for this type of purchse nor would have been able to understand the terms and conditions fully as this content is very difficult to understand for a XX/XX/XXXX English speaker. It will be greatly appreciated if you could assist me in this matter as this affects my peace of mind and I am under a lot of stress due to this situation. Any correspondence regarding this case could be mailed to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NJ XXXX or email me back to XXXX or my sons email XXXX, who is helping me with this complaints as my English is not the best. 
Thanks a lot for your attention. XXXX XXXX."
536,"I obtained a secured credit card from WELLS FARGO in 2014. This secured card was for the amount of {$300.00} I obtained this card under the guise that it was a tool for rebuilding my credit and that if i used the card an made my payments on time that the limit would go up and that that it would become a regular credit card. I have had this Wells FARGO secured credit card for over 3 years. in that time i have never made a late payment nor even so much as waited for my bill. In fact I have, consistently, paid this card off in full every month. <P/>
I have patiently waited for Wells Fargo to increase the amount and return my {$300.00} as promised for proper usage of this card. Instead i have been paying annual fees as well as usage fees and and exorbitant cash advance fees for it when it covers as overdraft protection for my well bank account. ( I have another credit card from XXXX XXXX that i obtained well after the Wells Fargo card and it was almost immediately increased and no longer a secured card. over a year in fact. ) My main problem with Wells Fargo, this card and their inappropriate action is : I am currently attempting to purchase a home. i have learned that this card has actually been detrimental to my credit and credit score due in fact to none other than its minimal limit. I. E. I rent a car for the weekend and it costs me {$160.00} however XXXX puts a standard {$300.00} hold on any card for security purposes. Well this shows on my credit score as exhausting my available credit resources, or at the very least exceeding the preferred 30 % usage of available credit. having and using this card regardless of payment history has held my score back not improving it. ( by the current standards the only way that this card would improve my limit is by my having it, paying fees for it but never using it! ) What has it done to those less fortunate and with less income who could barely afford the {$300.00}. to start. How much money and fees have i paid for the usage of my own money."
538,"I hate to bother you for something so small but I have tried everything from calling to emailing to complaining but Wells Fargo refuses to fix the UNFAIR redemption policy.
<P/>
THE UNFAIR PRACTICE : It is VERY UNFAIR that you can ONLY REDEEM in {$25.00} increments.
No other credit card, that I know, has such a condition.
It is inherently UNFAIR because it always will leave customer SHORT.
If the customer has over {$25.00} or under {$25.00} rewards balance, the customer will always be short and never able to redeem the FULL amount that customer has RIGHTFULLY earned.
It is virtually impossible for the customer to get exact {$25.00} redemption amount, because redemption amounts are calculated at various different levels of 1-3 % of purchase."
539,"I contacted the local store before I submitted a request to open a secured card with wells fargo. I asked the branch worker if my card will graduate to a unsecured card within a year. She assured me that it would. It has been 16 months and my card is still a secured card. I have reached out to the executive consumer department and they keep giving me a run around because they said I opened the card online. I did but it was based on the pretense of the information I received from the branch. This is ridiculous, I am trying to find out exactly why the account did not graduate. The only thing they keep telling me is that its based on the overall interaction with the company. Since I have opened this card my account has never been late and I haven't had a bounce check or account in an overdraft status. This is a ploy for this company to keep consumers money. I have asked for details explaining this and have yet to receive an answer."
543,"Regarding Dispute ID XXXX I purchased an airline ticket using my Wells Fargo Credit Card on XX/XX/XXXX to merchant XXXX XXXX for an amount of {$890.00}. The flight was and international flight using a non domestic airline XXXX XXXX and scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. The coronavirus pandemic shut down the borders of our country and this flight was cancelled. I filed a chargeback with Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX to attempt to get my money back for this flight, due to the fact that the flight was cancelled by the airline due to a global public health crisis. Wells Fargo did not allow the chargeback due to 1 ) I acknowledged both verbally and in writing that the ticket is non refundable and was set by the airline company ( XXXX XXXX ) and 2 ) in an act of "" goodwill '' the airline has authorized a waiver to use the credit in the future of another trip. I responded to this declination with a copy of the United States of America Department of Transportation Office Enforcement Notice Regarding Refunds by Carriers Given the Unprecedented Impact of the COVID19 Public Health Emergency on Air Travel Declaration that was published on XX/XX/XXXX. Due to the fact that this flight was cancelled directly due to border closures caused by the COVID19 Public Health Emergency, this declaration is supposed to provide me consumer protection for the airfare I purchased with this Credit Card IN SPITE OF the non refundable status that I agreed to during the initial purchase in that I should receive a full refund NOT A VOUCHER FOR TRAVEL for this special circumstance ( see attached ). I received a response in XX/XX/XXXX from Wells Fargo that its position regarding the chargeback was not changed despite this. In the time since receiving this, I filed a complaint with the Department of Transportation against XXXX XXXX. The US Department of Transportation has filed action against XXXX XXXX stating that their refusal to provide full refunds in lieu of vouchers was in violation of US law. Additionally, XXXX XXXX entered into an agreement with the XXXX Government that required the Airline to offer eligible customers who purchased non-refundable fares but did not travel due to COVID19 since XX/XX/XXXX the option of a refund to the original form of payment ( see attached ). I even received an email dated XX/XX/XXXX that I was now eligible for a refund from XXXX XXXX ( see attached ) .I contacted XXXX XXXX at this time to receive my refund. Since XX/XX/XXXX I have spoken to at least three different "" travel agents '' to get my refund, all with no luck.I have submitted refund initiation forms. These "" travel agents '' do not speak english and appears that they follow a "" script '' while handling calls. I have asked ( via phone ) to speak to a manager at XXXX XXXX regarding this refund. I have asked to be provided the contact information ( either phone number or email ) to their "" special claims '' department and I was told that they do not take phone calls and requests for an email contact have fallen on deaf ears. Additionally, I tried calling XXXX XXXX 's customer service line at XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX no less than 100 times in the past few months to obtain my refund. Calls to this line only resulted in a pre-recorded message that the call volume was too large to answer my call and try back later. I have done everything in my power to obtain this money that is due back to me from these merchants. I called Wells Fargo Credit Card services again to see if the chargeback could happen with all of this documentation that has gone on in the past year. I spoke to an "" escalation specialist '' on XX/XX/XXXX who told me she would research and get back to me. I received a document dated XX/XX/XXXX from Wells Fargo stating that their original finding still stands in that the there was a "" valid resolution with the merchant and the cancellation was processed via the merchants resolved issue by offering a credit voucher for future travel plans '' attaching the original documentation from the XX/XX/XXXX finding. 

Wells Fargo Bank has violated several Federal Laws and Policies with their decision : 1 ) Wells Fargo violated the Enforcement Notice Regarding Refunds by Carriers Given the Unprecdented Impact of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency on Air Travel which states that for airline tickets that were purchased for travel during the COVID-19 pandemic IN SPITE OF REFUND STATUS AT TIME OF PURCHASE ( please see attached document of this declaration in its entirety ). Therefore, Wells Fargo 's assertation that this matter is resolved due to the 1 ) non refundable status at time of purchase and 2 ) acceptance of a voucher travel for future travel is in violation of federal law. In fact, in the months since the exact opposite has come to light as XXXX XXXX has been ordered to provide refunds by both the United States and XXXX Government and sent me a email stating so!

2 ) Wells Fargo violated the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) by not allowing the chargeback, specifically that the charge resulted for "" goods and services you didn't accept or that weren't delivered as agreed ''. In addition to the above violation, the "" resolution '' was no resolution for me. XXXX XXXX is a non-domestic carrier and borders to foreign countries have been closed and slow to re-open in addition to the continued health risks of traveling at this time. A "" voucher '' is useless. Additionally, I am considered a first responder and an essential employee, making time away from work difficult during this pandemic. The protections provided to me as a consumer have been violated. 

I have tried relentlessly to get my rightfully due refund from the merchant. I have spent dozens of hours calling and trying and I have gotten nowhere. My next step is to take legal action."
544,"On XX/XX/2019 Wells Fargo notified me that they had detected unusual activity on my account. my credit card was used to make an online purchase at guitarcenter.com in the amount of {$1100.00}.

I did call Wells Fargo to let them know I did not ask for an address change, and to change my address back to my home address ( XXXX XXXX ). They then "" cancelled '' the credit card that was originally sent to GA, and sent a new one to my actual address. I went in person to Wells  Fargo on XX/XX/2019, to speak to a manager and to again dispute this outrageous charge, to which they said they could not help me and told me I needed to call XXXX XXXX. I closed my account with them on XX/XX/2019. I received a call from whom I assumed was a creditor representing Wells Fargo saying they would be closing this case. I then began receiving multiple Bills via email and USP mail from Wells Fargo demanding I pay for these charges, and also the interest that had been accumulated for the months following. Since I have refused to pay this debt that is absolutely not mine, my credit score has dropped significantly, and Wells Fargo has been no help at all, though I've attempted to call and speak to different Managers  my issue has fallen on deaf ears. I did file a police report on XX/XX/2019 with SJPD."

Called customer service and was told THERE IS NO WAY to apply my EXTRA payment to my upcoming XXXX payment. 

Called again, told the same thing, and asked for supervisor. Undoubtedly was the person sitting next to the one I asked to transfer me to her Supervisor. No chance this was a Supervisor. Or if so they need to fire all their supervisors. Supervisor told me nothing in the universe could allow WF to apply this vast overpayment to my XXXX  payment.

Wells Fargo XXXX. Its not enough that they stole millions or billions a couple years ago through criminal practices. Clearly WF still wants to do things the same way.

I am trans, and they opened the account with the wrong legal name, address, and phone number, without confirming my identity, which is a XXXX violation. I noticed the discrepancy at the end of the month, and attempted to contact Wells Fargo to correct the issue. After a 3 hour phone call, I was informed that I would have to provide additional information so they could verify that I exist, and provide them with my ID. On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to a local branch in XXXX, and provided my ID card, and answered their questions, and was told that the situation was addressed and that my name had been changed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was provided an email that they considered this to be fraud, and had closed my account because I was trans. This is discrimination under the basis of XXXX, per XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is a violation of Reg B. I attempted to gain additional information about this, and was told to talk to the credit bureaus who had no information as to why I had my account closed.

551,"I applied for a credit card in my name from Wells Fargo. My husband had just received a card from them. He applied online and the card arrived in less than a week. 

After following the exact process as my husband, I received a letter that stated that my card was denied because Wells Fargo could not identify me. This is because most of our assets are held jointly by my husband and myself. In order for me to get a card, I have to submit three pieces of ID : a government document with my photo, and at least three months of documentation from each of two accounts that have only my name on them. And, they will not accept email or USPS mail, only fax or delivery in person to a Wells Fargo branch. The nearest one is more than 50 miles away. 

I have contributed to Social Security since I was XXXX. I am now XXXX  and receive a Social Security check each month. I am a retired teacher and receive a pension from the State of New jersey. Our home is owned jointly by my husband and me, without a mortgage as are all other accounts. Our credit rating is over 800. I do have two accounts in my own name, but why is this necessary for me and not my husband? 

My complaint is that because I am a woman, I have to jump through hoops to get a credit card in my name ; my husband only had to apply. Why do I want this credit card? 
A friend who was recently widowed was shocked when all of the credit cards in joint name were stopped upon her husband 's death.

553,"A balance transfer was made in the amount of {$5600.00} in XXXX of XXXX from my XXXX XXXX card to a Wells Fargo card. I began contacting XXXX XXXX in late XXXX because the balance transfer had not come off of that account. Throughout summer, both companies were contacted multiple times. Wells Fargo completed several research requests concluding that they did send the funds. XXXX XXXX still stated the funds were not seen. In XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo and discovered that the last 4 digits of the account number they sent the funds to did not match my account. I am unsure how these numbers got changed. To remove the balance from my account, XXXX XXXX is requesting an EFT report showing that the funds were sent. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo requesting that further documentation be sent showing that the balance transfer occurred. They stated that the only proof they could provide is my statement. The statement had already been sent to XXXX XXXX and was determined to be insufficient proof of transfer. Wells Fargo stated that the only other option is a custom letter. I again called XXXX XXXX to let them know. After some discussion, a three way call was done between myself, the XXXX XXXX representative named XXXX, and the Wells Fargo representative named XXXX. This call was recorded on both sides. XXXX stated to XXXX that the EFT report was all that was needed to resolve the issue. XXXX stated multiple times that he understood the request but Wells Fargo was unable to provide that, and that the only proof that they could provide was my statement or a letter. XXXX let him know that those options are not sufficient. He acknowledged that information. XXXX placed a request for both the EFT and a letter but acknowledged that it is unlikely that the EFT will be sent. He also stated that regardless of the outcome, there is no way to cancel the balance transfer, leaving me to pay the balance on both cards. 

I have now have the same balance on two cards. XXXX XXXX has temporarily refunded the balance to allow me to submit further documentation but it will be recharged to the account if sufficient documents are not sent."
554,Wells Fargo has ruined my credit score and made it impossible for me to open a checking savings or business credit card. I had a secure credit card.

It was not until I went to check my statement on XX/XX/2022 that I was made aware of the charge. I immediately called their fraud department to report it. Their ultimate resolution was that since it was made through their online banking portal, I had authorized it. I have repeatedly informed them that this is not the case. At the time of the transfer, I received no text or notification that such a large cash advance had been made, or that anyone had logged onto my account from a new device."

It is not my charge and was not made by me. I never signed or provided information. I would have no reason to make this charge. 

When the charge appeared, I called the merchant number and they claimed they could cancel whatever was charged at that time. They then directed me to WF if the charge was not reversed for some reason. 

WF admitted that the Corporate Headquarter sent information that showed their concern as well and that they did not have sufficient information to process these charges. I do not recall the exact terminology translated by WF for the merchant, but clearly WF knew that this dispute process was not followed properly as they explained to me. They stated that when they received this information they should have continued to the next step and they failed to do so. It may be that WF ran out of time for the dispute process so just neglected handling it. WF then sent letters claiming that I paid monthly on the account therefore they had no dispute rights. They have failed to properly credit the account."
562,"On XX/XX/2020 my bill for {$21.00} did not go through when it was on auto-bill. I reached out to the company 31 days after, made the payment in full, because the only notification I got that it didnt go through was from it hitting my credit with a 30 day late payment. They never notified me of the bank rejection of the payment. I now can not qualify for a mortgage because of this mark on my credit and the company will not help me with this very unfair situation."
565,"XX/XX/XXXX I was told by Wells Fargo that I am a victim of a cyber spoofing scam. Wells Fargo told me, someone using my username and password was able to access funds from my Wells Fargo credit card account, transfer funds into my checking account and then wire those funds to another bank account. 
XX/XX/XXXX date of the cyber attack, I received a call from XXXX XXXX, a man explained he was an agent of Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX report suspicious activity with my checking account. XXXX, the agent I was working with said he needed to send a six digit code to me to verify my identity. He explained I needed to repeat it back to him, which I did. Not at any time did I give my username or password. I logged into my account using my laptop to investigate. Thats when I became aware {$11000.00} had been withdrawn from my Wells Fargo credit card and the transferred into my checking account and then {$11000.00} was wire transferred to a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account. I wasnt aware by giving the initial six digit code this agentwould be able to enroll me in wire transfers, add a recipient, withdraw the funds from my credit card, deposit those funds into our joint checking account, only to have those funds wired to another bank. The agent gave me a claim number for the fraud and advised me they would be calling me back within 24 hours to update me on the claim. He suggested I would then order new cards and go to our bank to close the hacked account. 
XX/XX/XXXX I had not heard back from the agent so I called Wells Fargo to confirm the claim number and they couldnt verify the number. I proceeded to explain my situation to the claims agent and he issued two claims one for the wire and one for the transfer of funds from my credit card. Every claim takes 10 days to investigate. 
I have been diligent about contacting Wells Fargo claims, stressing I didnt enroll in wire transfers! Here are dates of contact XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX my husband and I went to our local Wells Fargo Bank closed our checking and opened a new one. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a police report XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX case # XXXX. 

We received a letter in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX from Wells Fargo saying the claim was denied and the case was closed. I allergy our local bank and tried 3 times to get an appointment but the local manager was short handed and could not meet with us. A Wells Fargo manager called me and set up an appointment for XX/XX/XXXX to discuss my case. The morning of our appointment, someone had hacked our brand new checking account and made two fraudulent charges. We had to close the new account and open another new account. The Wells Fargo manager called the claims department while we were at the bank and had a new agent reopen the case. The Wells Fargo manager gave us a new claim number and told us we should hear back within 10 days. Ive filed three claims of fraud with Wells Fargo but they are firm on the wire transfer agreement. It states whether or not we authorized the transaction we are responsible. They said someone else used our username and password and we are liable for the wire. 
Ive asked what code, username and password were given on XX/XX/XXXX and no one at Wells Fargo claims could tell me that information. Not one time did any of Wells Fargos agents call and ask me any questions about this investigation. All of their findings are based on the wire policy agreement ( even though Ive denied signing up ) and the use of my username and password. 
I have a log of correspondences between Wells Fargo XXXX and myself. 
XX/XX/XXXX I received a secured email from Wells Fargo referencing claim # XXXX. It states in the claim there was evidence of fraud with my credit card but not with the wire transfer. When the claims department tried to get the funds back from the recipients bank they were gone. 

XX/XX/XXXX received a phone call from XXXX XXXX, an executive with Wells Fargo, stating their findings havent changed. Wells Fargo denied my claim because my username, password and a code was given to authorize the wire transfer. I only gave one code, the same type of code every real Wells Fargo agent asks for, never did I give anyone my usernames or passwords. 

XX/XX/XXXX I filed an FBI, Internet Crime complaint with XXXX I will continue to fight this illegal, fraudulent wire. 

I have shut off all my credit cards with Wells Fargo."
568,"I had filled out an application online. While reading the terms and conditions and paging down to see them all, the application submitted without me touching any buttons. 

I called Wellsfargo and after being on hold and passed around to 5 different people. 

The first number I called was XXXX and spoke to XXXX who transferred me to XXXX at XXXX and spoke to XXXX who transferred me to XXXX at XXXX. 

Then I received an email saying to call XXXX if I did not submit the application. I spoke to XXXX who said she needed to transfer me to another department. Instead she transferred me to the main menu of the phone number I had called. 

I had to wait another 10 minutes then spoke to XXXX who claimed she had to escalate the issue. Then she gave me two more phone numbers, XXXX for the application status department and XXXX for the escalation case management. 

Instead of this being handled as the email said I could do if I did not submit the application I have been transferred over and over and only given phone numbers and a reference number, then told they would contact me within 2 business days. 

The reference number I was given is XXXX. 

I have been on the phone with all of this for over an hour and a half due to this application being fraudulently submitted, with no results. 

I was wary of doing anything with Wells fargo with the lawsuits they have had. This is why I was reading the terms and conditions. They have their website set up for it to submit the application if you have filled out the information even though you have not touched any submit button.

The foster mother agreed, happily. XX/XX/XXXX ( approximately 11 days after we paid for XXXX ) my husband and I agreed that we were going to take some time 'off ' from one another and separate now that my daughter is no longer living with us. Of course bringing another dog into this situation is not ideal, so I let the foster mom know, as well as the head of the organization that we would not be taking XXXX at this time.

The head of the organization texted me that she held onto the dog for 4 weeks, which was incorrect. She had the puppy in her care for approximately 11 days before I cancelled. I did not want to cancel, it was not the outcome that I had anticipated but I don't think keeping a deposit for something I never took possession of to begin with fair.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I fell on hard times and was late a few times on my payment, so they increased my interest rate to 21 %. I quickly got caught back up and started making on time payments again. In fact, I have not been late in over 10 years and have a XXXX+ credit score, yet they kept my interest rate the same ( at 21 % ). I always felt I was being penalized wrongly and that they should reinstate a lower interest rate once I proved good payment history with them. Over the course of a decade, I have called their customer service and even visited my local branch. to see if they would lower my interest rate. There were interest rate promos for new customers that I was not "" eligible '' for. Every time, I would be told that I was not eligible for a lower rate. I have even paid this card off in full on various occasions. They trust me enough to keep increasing my credit limit, however no break in the interest. 

I've had multiple accounts with this bank since XX/XX/XXXX so I have resisted changed banks because it would be quite a bit of work. 
I did some research on your website, and from what I can see, WF should be reviewing and assessing my account every 6 months, and that afte

To my surprise this and the subsequent investigation were both closed, informing me that, because I had my credit card in my possession, they must have been me and the charge was reinstated to my account along with interest on the charge. In several recent conversations with the fraud claims department I have ask for this to be escalated, I was assured I would receive a call within XXXX4-48 hours from the executive office, as they have the ability to look further into a claim. It has currently been over XXXX hours. I called in again this evening to check on a status of the request. I was told that it is only assigned within XXXX hours ( which would have been yesterday ) but this was not assigned to anyone yet and to call back Monday and hope it has been assigned. I was hung up on after that. I am only requesting that the bank actually looks into this claim far enough to see that this charge is fraud and remove it from my account along with any interest that has accrued. I have filed a police report in regards to the charge and a detective has the receipt from the transaction. I am out of options and am exhausted from the bullying of a customer by my own bank."
589,"Wells Fargo ( WF ) Credit Card Security Breach. On XXXX, I received a call from from WF credit card fraud department, listed as XXXX on my caller ID ) asking me to verify an attempted charge to my Visa account at XXXX. I called WF at XXXX and spoke to a WF agent who confirmed the call was indeed from WF. My concern is that I did open that account long ago but I never activated it, never used it, and the card has not been out of my locked desk drawer at home, and absolutely no one has access to it. XXXX confirmed that the card was never activated and never before used. My question is, since the card has not been out of my desk drawer and was never activated for use, how did someone obtain my credit card information to use on XXXX. It is clear that the account information was obtained directly from WF files, either internally or through a hack. I would like an investigation into how this happened and how many other people face the same security breach. I expressed the concern to the WF agent but they are making no indication of investigation."
593,"On XX/XX/XXXX - I needed to use my Wellsfargo Credit Card, and it was declined. So I called customer service and was informed the account was closed. At this point, I have not received notification from Wellsfargo about the unilateral decision. I had no balance, always paid my bill on time, and been a Wellsfargo Credit Card holder since XXXX. According to the customer representative the bank had not sent a written notification, and was unable to let me know when will I be formally notified."
595,"XX/XX/XXXX I recieved a new wells frago credit card. I call wells frago to activate my card. The customer service agent asks for my checking account information. The customer service agent types in the checking account information incorrectly, missing one number. From XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX all my payments came back as insufficient funds on the wells frago side, even though all the funds were in my checking account. XX/XX/XXXX I call in to make my usually payment. I describe my issue with the customer service agent XXXX. She says let 's check the information to see if we have everything correct. XXXX discovers the checking account number was off by one number, a single digit. Wells Fargo found all this information in their systems. But they refused to take any responsibility."
599,"Currently, I'm going through a home refinance. Upon review of my credit information, I was advised by my lender that my XXXX 's account serviced through Wells Fargo was reporting negatively. On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to XXXX XXXX customer service and was advised that my account had been charged off on/or around XX/XX/XXXX. Based on the information I was advised during that call, it was due to me failing to make a payment on/before XX/XX/XXXX. 
I purchased a pair of shoes and unfortunately did not receive them in time for a trip I had planned so I returned them on XX/XX/XXXX. This was and had been the only transaction on my account in a year. During the conversation with the representative on XX/XX/XXXX, I was advised that I would have still needed to make a payment by the due date even though the item was returned and then any excess amount would have been later credited back. I attempted to return the shoes on XX/XX/XXXX, however this is one of the stores busiest times of the year for their XXXX XXXX sale and I was unable to get in to return them. 
Throughout the this timeframe, XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX I had not received any correspondence ( Statements ) or phone calls ( Collection attempts ) advising of an amount owed. During the conversation, the representative confirmed that records displayed the last outbound phone call to me was in XXXX of the 2020 year and that she did not know why no calls had not been attempted to collect on the balance owed. Per the representative, the only transaction amount that was due once the return was processed was the late fee for not paying by XX/XX/XXXX and the associated interest. 
It is not until just this past weekend, XXXX XXXX XXXX or shortly prior that I have received a statement stating I have an amount owed of XXXX due on XX/XX/XXXX and another letter ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) stating my XXXX XXXX account has been closed due to terms violation. 
Had I received statements or even a phone call to notify me of the amount due, I could have made a payment to cover the amount, preventing from the account reporting negatively to the credit bureau and ultimately being charged off over a late payment fee and interest."

604,"When I received my Wells Fargo Business Card statement for XX/XX/XXXXXXXX, there was a {$600.00} Cash Advance taken without my knowledge on XX/XX/XXXX from my Business account XXXX XXXX XXXX. I never take out cash advances on any of my credit cards. I told the bank this when I opened my business account on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX under both my maiden name and married name. I asked Wells Fargo Bank in XXXX, NC for documentation and the signature was electronically superimposed on the form. This account ended in XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX Platinum Card. They responded that it "" appears to match my signature on file. '' I made a payment in cash on XX/XX/XXXX at that bank on another credit card. I manually did not sign for any cash advance as I try to keep my balances paid off or I pay {$1.00} - XXXX on my credit cards and would have no need for {$600.00} when I paid the other card in cash that same day. The time was not stamped on the cash advance form. I went to XXXX that day also. Without the video of that transaction, showing me counting the {$600.00} in front of the cashier, I know someone in that bank, having access to numerous signatures, particularly my Business Operating Agreement looked similar except the account has two last names, not just one. No printed receipt of the cash being paid to me either. This was no mistake, my personal banker was terminated and is under investigation for this. A rep. from the XXXX XXXX, NC branch wanted to transfer to XXXX and is now sitting in my personal banker 's office. This bank scammed me and is covering up for the person who actually hacked my account. They may have done this cash advance scam on others who do n't check their statements. I requested a form two weeks ago from your office so I could mail my documentation but it did n't come. Wells Fargo is FDIC but refuses to provide the video showing me getting the {$600.00} because they do n't have it. They took out my middle name from my signature files and only put my married name on it, Since XX/XX/XXXXI have had accounts with Wells Fargo and NEVER one cash advance. PLEASE investigate the Wells Fargo SCAM of taking Cash Advances from their customers."

606,"I have a Wells Fargo Home Rebate card which I pay in full monthly. On XX/XX/XXXX, I logged in and scheduled my payment in full of {$4000.00}. I erroneously scheduled the payment for the same day rather than the due date. I realized the error immediately and tried to cancel the payment. There was no option to cancel. I called Wells Fargo and the representative said he would cancel the payment when posted. I wanted to make sure there was no effort to present the payment. I was told that it shouldnt. Unfortunately, the payment was presented to my bank which cause many issues with my account. I called on XX/XX/XXXX to see when the reversal would take place. I was told it would take 20-15 business days. This is absolutely ridiculous for an error that I should have been able to correct online. Within 10-15 business days, the regular payment will be due causing more problems."
607,"On XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a ring from XXXX XXXX for a total of {$7700.00}. When going over my purchase options the Jeweler informed me that they have financing for 0 % interest for 6 months to 1 year. I told them I preferred to pay cash but would have to go to the bank, the stated I might as well do the financing to help with credit. I asked if this would be a soft or hard inquiry into my credit, and told them I was planning on opening a new credit card account so this was important to me, which they replied just a soft inquiry. Upon being approved they told me how much I was approved for {$5600.00} so i paid the remaining balance of {$2100.00}. They say I will just have to keep up with monthly payments and make sure to pay it all off before the 0 % interest runs out, I was planning on just paying it all off at once. Later I come to find out what they had done is issue me a credit card that was maxed out to the {$5600.00} and that it was a hard inquiry on my credit report. Had I known this I would never have agreed to the financing options. XXXX XXXX has basically said they are sorry and will work on informing their staff to take better precautions on how they advertise the financing. Wells Fargo was unable to assist me over the phone yet."

One totally butchers my first name, the other my last name. Is this an indidcation on the thoroughness of Wells Fargo's work? In both letters Welss Fargo promisses to remove or reclassify the inquiries which were made about my credit report with XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX.I just checked my XXXX credit report and none such action by Wells Fargo is reflected."

There were 2 charges on my card that i did not authorize. I reached out to bank and they were going to do an investigation. They sent me back a letter saying that this charges were made by me ....

613,"Although I sent payment to Wells Fargo bank on time, they still charged me a {$15.00} late fee and {$5.00} in interest. I called to correct the issue and they agreed to credit back the {$15.00} and {$5.00} charges and I sent a payment for the full amount less the {$20.00} that was to be credited back. However, they did not credit the {$5.00} interest and as a result my account was marked as carrying a balance and charge {$2.00} in interest the next month. I called a second time and the agent agreed to credit the {$5.00} as originally promised, but would not credit back the {$2.00}. That {$2.00} of interest should not have been changed and I would like it refunded to me."
615,"There was an unauthorized charge of {$2000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX via a "" online advance ''. I did not authorize this, nor have I ever. My claim was wrongfully denied."
616,I have reached out to Wells Fargo requesting a letter for our lender saying our CC 's have been paid off. They refused to send it to anyone else rather than my lender allowing me access to my information.
618,"Originally open the account because of offer from the store for a discount. 

When I got the first bill in the mail I called them made payment for the full balance on the card, and requested for them to put the account on auto pay like I do all my cards, from my checking account that I made payment from # XXXX. I was told I either had to use the website or mail a form to me to return. I chose the letter because I've had problems with some websites before. Having completed that, I assumed the next bill would be Auto drafted. I was out of town in XXXX, coming back to tons of mail, I found a letter where they had sent my {$85.00} purchase in XXXX for collections and now when I called to ask why it wasn't on auto pay they told me I never got it set up. Now they want {$160.00} something dollars. I just told them it was unacceptable. They told me they would continue to add interest to the bill if I didn't pay it all. They offered me the card after I had already refused at the store to begin with, I was trying to put it on my credit card that I'm had for years thats on auto pay."
621,"I was charged a finance charge on a credit card balance. It was for {$1.00} XXXX dollar. I was marked as 30 days late on my credit report.

I would like Wells Fargo to remove the 30 day late from my credit file."
622,"On XX/XX/2020, my credit card account at Wells Fargo was closed due to reasons unknown. I've made 100 % of my payments on time and have had the account for many years. Wells Fargo did not send me any notifications that my account would be closed and gave me ZERO notice. I tried calling Wells Fargo 4+ times over the past couple of days to figure out what happened and each time I was forwarded to a number that would put me on hold for 25 minutes before ending the call and hanging up on me. This account was one of my oldest credit accounts which made my credit score drop significantly when it was closed for no reason. Now I can not get an apartment lease or mortgage because of the impact it's had on my credit score."
623,"On XXXX XXXX, 2017 I applied for a credit card through Wells Fargo. My application decision was initially delayed. I eventually received a credit decision by calling the automated application status line and was approved. This decision was made within 48 hours of my application.

On XXXX XXXX, I noticed through Wells Fargo 's online portal that my new credit account had been closed without prior notification. On XXXX XXXX, I sent a message through the online portal inquiring why my account was marked as closed and was told to call and speak in person with a representative.
<P/>
On XXXX XXXX, I called and spoke with one customer service representative to learn more about the situation. Through this interaction, I learned that Wells Fargo 's "" executive fraud department '' had flagged my account and closed it. I was then told to wait for a letter in the mail detailing the reason for this closure.
<P/>
On XXXX XXXX, I called Wells Fargo again to inquire more about the situation and see how it would be reported to the credit bureaus. I was told that if I still wanted the credit account, I would need to fully apply again. I was also told that this account would still be reported to the credit bureaus as opened for one month, despite the fact that I never used the account and had never even received the card for the account."
626,"Wells Fargo Bank has my credit card mark as a late payment back in XXXX I called them to alert them to ask for a extension to pay the bill at a later date, Wells Fargo ok that I can pay the bill 20 fays later.

633,"I applied for the wells Fargo cash advance credit card XX/XX/XXXX and deposit a balance transfer check of {$16000.00} I received in mail on XX/XX/XXXX from Wells Fargo cash advance credit card department following the instruction provided by their customer service rep. 
It was cleared on Sunday XX/XX/XXXX and I started to pay off other credit cards and bills on XX/XX/XXXX like the customer rep suggested.But it turned out Wells Fargo Credit Card Department voided the balance transfer check later on XX/XX/XXXX which resulted a {$9500.00} cash advances kicked in my Wells Fargo due to that Wells Fargo balance check voided. 

So, I went to the branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Pa for help and private banker XXXX helped me escalate the case on XX/XX/XXXX and she called me back 2 weeks later as she promised and told me that the issue was resolved, all the overdrafted fees were waived and the {$9500.00} cash advance was corrected to balance transfer like I initially planned. Also, I was told that there would be no interest will be charged and I could complete the remaining amount of {$6800.00} ( $ XXXX- {$9500.00} ) balance transfer and take advantage of the 0 % interest if I want.So, I did the balance transfer of {$5900.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. However, I realized there were intrest charged and has been calling for having the issue resolved. Wells fargo refund intrest of {$540.00}. 46 but refused to refund the remaining intrest of {$1300.00}. 89. To avoid being charged continuesly, I ended up paid off all the balance transfer and the cash advance on XX/XX/XXXX since the banker told me any extra payment I made every month would paid towards balance transfer amount only but not the cash advance balance and I could not just pay off the cash advance balance first. I have submitted complains to their escalation team more than 4 times and just received their last final notice from XXXX XXXX. from Executive Office Case Specialist on XX/XX/XXXX and they still refuse to refund all the intrest they charged. Also, the last case was assinged to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX before I received the letter. I had options to use other bank 's balance transfer benefit and also resolve the cash advance intrest charge if they did not tell issue was resolved and their misinstruction to begin with. So, I demand them refund me the remaining of intrest of {$1300.00}. 89 they unfairly charged."

638,"XXXX XXXX XXXX  and Wells Fargo I had agreed to 2 2hour sessions in the XXXX XXXX. Each at {$1300.00} plus tip. The merchant charged me 3 times. Twice for {$1300.00} plus tip and once for {$3200.00} The girl working the register ( XXXX XXXX XXXX  rung me up for my first 2 hours at the beginning of the session. I signed and closed out. Then she came back after those 2 hours were over and asked if I wanted to buy another 2 hour session. I said yes. So she rung me up again and I signed and closed out. This is when the scam starts. She came back a little later and told me that the bank was declining my payments and she needed another card. So I gave her a different card but that was also declined. At this point they are playing musical cards with me. She told me to give her my phone so she can respond to the bank via text and authorize the transaction. I didnt give her the phone but I needed to pay still so I responded yes. Then she came back with another receipt I had to sign for both 2 hour sessions ( 4 hours ). After the 4 hours I went to the bar and bought a water to tip the bartender and left around XXXX XXXX XXXX have a copy of the XXXX receipt showing what time I left and how it was physically impossible for me to be at the club for 8 hours worth of XXXX XXXX. 

I called the club on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX and I told the girl working they scammed me. She defended the club and we discussed the charges and what I had received. She confirmed that the XXXX XXXX was {$1300.00} for XXXX hours. So I said if it isnt a scam than it is a double charge. She told me I would have to call back when the accountant was in. I spoke to the accountant and told her what happened and she said the GM, XXXX, would pull the receipts and get back to me. 

I waited a few days and I finally got a hold of the gm. He is now claiming they were charging {$1300.00} an hour for the XXXX XXXX and not for 2 hours. I asked if this was the case, why I was charged for 1 hour increments before the first 2 hour session, then charged for 1 hour for the 2nd 2 hour session and then again for just 2 hours. It would make a lot more sense to charge for 2 hours before the time starts, come back after the time ends, see if customer wants another 2 hours, then charge them for that 2 hours ( This is how it actually happened until my card was declined ). He had no explanation. He was just accusing me of being drunk and spending too much money. I didnt have a drink once I entered the club. I drank none of the alcohol provided to me in the XXXX XXXX I was sobering up as the night went on. I asked if the girl still works there and he said yes her name was XXXX. She told me her name was XXXX. I dont know if XXXX is a real name or another stage name. 

The girl was trying to hustle all night. Things like telling me I messed up her new nails and had to do something to fix it. The 2nd 2 hour session was just her complaining the whole time I wouldnt agree to a 3rd 2 hour session. 

I have been trying to dispute this with my credit card company ( wells fargo ) for months now but they've been absolutely no help. I'm just continually being transferred from person to person and it seems no one knows how to help, who can help, or just how to do their job."
640,"Wells Fargo charged a deferred 12 months interest to my account. 30 % of my principal balance. I was told when I signed up for the card that I would have no interest for 12 months, and then it would start to begin incurring interest in the 13th month. I was never told and it was never explained to me what deferred interest was or that that was the terms of the card that I signed up for. 3 weeks ago I noticed a charge for 72 % of my remaining balance. I called Wells Fargo, who told me there was nothing they could do because I did not have any issues with my mailing address, even though I never received any notices stating any of this information. I am still within 30 days of the charge as of today. I feel like I have been duped into paying much more than I ever would have agreed to."

I've now have been doubling up on the monthly payments, but the balance only goes down temporary, then a few days later, goes back up. Would like a thorough explanation and written formula of how each interest rate is calculated for each account.

I would like a completed transcript of all transactions of all of my account ( s ) from day one : 1 home equity line, and 5 high interest credit cards that were opened and just appeared online and available.

Solutions : a. re-activate my {$50000.00} line of credit. payoff those high interest credits, at 6 %. b. have someone enroll me in Wellsfargo 's federal hardship program for the high interest credit cards ( no one helps when I called Wellsfargo online number : XXXX ) c. refund the difference between the high interest cards and 6 % ( to pay down the credit cards )"
644,"I opened a Wells Fargo pre-paid credit card in hopes that I could rebuild my credit score  after XXXX. I deposited the required amount and was promised that after XXXX year I would receive my deposit back and an increased line of credit. That did not happen. The terms of my original agreement changed. I disputed this change with Wells Fargo and was told that my available credit limit ( lower than my deposit and the terms ), was to high to allow me to advance my card to a regular credit card. It took me multiple years to get my pre-paid card to turn into a credit card. Additional problems, fees, and credit reporting problems have occurred. I currently have a high credit score and Wells Fargo was misleading, years after opening this card effected my XXXX XXXX negatively with no missed payments, and overcharged me for interest percentages that were supposed to reduce when I completed the XXXX year of pre-paid and transitioned to actual credit card."

I took Wells Fargo to small claims court in XX/XX/XXXX and also won and had this exact same issue where they did not pay me within the 30 days I I had to write to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in order for them to finally pay me what I was owed, so this seems to be a pattern with Wells Fargo and I wonder if other consumers are complaining about this."

I addressed it to you and hope to hear from you personally. I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Veteran who lives on a very small XXXX check and a small Social security check. It takes a long time to save any money and it has been almost 20 years to save what I have in my savings account. My wife just recently had a very bad XXXX, and she does not work or bring in any money at all so we have to be very very careful where we spend our money. 

I have needed a hot tub for a very long time, since XX/XX/XXXX for all my XXXX and XXXX I received in XXXX XXXX and from our Federal government a good dosing of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. 

Last month our local hot tub supplier in XXXX, Arizona ( XXXX XXXX ) had a great deal on hot tubs that I thought I could afford to make the payments on, they were offering no interest for 9 Months if paid in full before that date arrived and they said it was through Wells Fargo. Right there I thought about how Wells Fargo XXXX so many people out of their money and my wife and I discussed it and said we thought we would give you a try since it sounded like you guys cleaned up your act and fixed all the wrong doings. 



Well we just got our 2nd request for payment and you guys charged me {$27.00} late fee which is XXXX, and said I was in arrears for {$210.00} which again is XXXX. 

I sent in my first check on XX/XX/XXXX, on check number # XXXX and my bank shows it clearing on XX/XX/XXXX, from my bank below CHECK # XXXX WELLS FARGO CARD CHECKPAYMT XX/XX/XXXX - ARC ID : XXXX Cleared Check {$600.00} it was not due till the end of XX/XX/XXXX. 

I just sent in another Check # XXXX for {$600.00}, it has not cleared as of yet, but this payment is not due till XXXX again. 

These payments were sent to Wells Fargo Bank NA, XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX on your own payment slip and envelope! 
Is your bank still XXXX these things up and misapplying payments! 

This afternoon I got on the phone about all these XXXX XXXX, and the person I spoke with said they had no record of my payment, he said I should contact my bank and ask them to send proof of this paid check to a fax number Attn : XXXX. My bank will not do that over the phone, so in the morning I and my wife have to drive 90 miles round trip to the bank and get this done. I am just hoping that this is not every month thing I have to do because I can not leave my wife alone and it takes some time to get her ready to travel! 

Rather than do every month my wife and I decided to take the balance owed to Wells Fargo in one lump sum and pay this in full by cashiers check, this will deplete my savings account drastically, but this is preferred over having to go through these things each month with a bank like yours! 

I am hoping that there is a XXXX somewhere where companies, banks and people go to and suffer for all the crimes and problems they cause people like us that play by the rules, live a good life, give back to the community and follow the golden rule. 

I am passing the word to all the military veterans about how I was treated by your bank, and there is 13 million of us and word will get out! 

If I should ever hear from you personally I would be blown off my feet, I wont hold my breath though! 


Sincerely, XXXX XXXX PS. Went this morning to my bank and they said Wells negotiated my {$600.00} check electronically on XX/XX/XXXX, and the Wells Transaction /Trace number was # XXXX. I then went to your Bank in XXXX and tried to get them to pull up this transaction number and they said they could not do this! 
WHY???????????????????????????????????????????. 

I also depleted our savings this morning to pay your XXXX   bill {$4700.00}. That coupled with the {$600.00} you cashed on XX/XX/XXXX and a recent check sent to you for another {$600.00} check ( # XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) pays this XXXX account in full and I will warn everyone what I had to put up with your bank. 
You guys are ALWAYS out to XXXX the little guy, but its us little guys that keep the country moving forward despite terrible un-American companies like Wells Fargo!

660,"There is a charge appearing on my credit card for {$60.00}. I filed a dispute via the Wells Fargo website on XX/XX/20 as I believe this was paid with another form of payment. Nothing was done with the dispute after a week or two, so I called Wells Fargo and spoke with a dispute specialist who told me they required documentation and would issue me a provisional credit in the meantime. I informed the agent that I uploaded the requested document right while we were on the phone and she said she would review it. In the meantime, I would have the credit. Now, it is XX/XX/20 and I just received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that they need me to RESUBMIT THE SAME INFORMATION I ALREADY UPLOADED. Further, the provisional credit I was promised during my call was never applied, so now my card has a balance when it should be reporting to my credit as a {$0.00} balance. Wells Fargo has failed to handle my claim properly and lied when the said they would issue a provisional credit."

The first check was for {$8300.00} ( tracking # XXXX XXXX. The second check was for {$1300.00} ( tracking # XXXX XXXX. 
I contacted Wells Fargo to let them know my mother was deceased and they stated they would reissue the checks ( from two different departments ) but they would need a copy of my ID and a copy of my mother 's Will. 
I sent them a copy of my social security card, drivers license, marriage license showing name change and a copy of my mother 's Will.

I have made numerous attempts to contact my sister through email, phone and text. She will not respond to meet me at the bank to cash this check. 

My complaint is : When I contacted Wells Fargo to have them cancel the check for {$8300.00} and reissue two checks, one to my sister and one to me, in the amounts of {$4100.00} each, they stated they can not reissue the check. I asked them if I'm just out {$8300.00} and the representatives response was YES. 

The second check for {$1300.00} is still being evaluated due to multiple names on my mother 's Will. 

I would appreciate any guidance you can offer in this matter.

663,"On approximately XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Well Fargo via phone to report a fraudulent transaction found on my card while completing taxes. The charge was made on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$1200.00} for a personal laptap which was picked up by a XXXX XXXX in XXXX, GA. The transaction was made online via XXXX to purchase from XXXX XXXX. I was in XXXXXXXX XXXX MT under a stay at home order due to COVID19 at the time of the purchase and was recovering from a prolonged illness earlier in XXXX. I completed an initial setup call and was told I would be contacted within 24-48 hours for additional information. 
I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX indicating they found the charge to be authorized and closed the file. I called as soon as I received the letter and requested to know the reasoning. The agent was not able to provide additional information, however she did open a reconsideration and I requested a copy of the documents used to make the determination. I was again told I would be contacted within 24-48 hours. 
I opened an fraud police report with XXXX XXXX XXXX 's office deputy XXXX XXXX around XX/XX/XXXX and was given case number XXXX. 
I contacted Wells Fargo via phone to ask how to submit substantiating documentation for my reconsideration. I was told I would be contacted if additional information was needed. I told the agent I was not asking if they needed anything, rather I had documentation I insisted on presenting. After much difficulty, I was told I could only fax documents for fraud claims. When I explained I do not have a fax, the agent suggested a local branch bank would fax the documents for me. 
XXXX XX/XX/XXXX the local branch manager faxed 3 pages of documents, including the online receipt showing another person 's name, the police report number, and the proof it was purchased online via XXXX which was linked to my credit card. 
I received another letter date XX/XX/XXXX stating the claim was denied. I again called as soon as it was received from Wells Fargo and asked for reasoning as well as to ask to speak with the person investigating the fraud in order to establish how to substantiate my claim. I was eventually told that they would open another reconsideration and "" she '' would either call or email me as the agent personally emailed "" her '' to contact me. I received no contact and the next day called again. I was told a complaint had been opened with the executive office and that I would have a case manager assigned to me for full resoluation. I was asked to be patient while the file was setup. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email confirming receipt of my complaint and that I would be contacted within 10 business days. 
In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter including the documents used to investigate my claim, it was on page indicating the agent called the retailer and they verified my details such as name and address ( which were incorrect in XXXX at the time of purchase as I do not use the service regularly ). 
XX/XX/XXXX, I called the executive office to check in with my case manager. I explained the circumstances and was told she would begin investigating shortly. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a message confirming assignment of my complaint and that it would be resolved by XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email extending my resolution date to XX/XX/XXXX regarding my complaint. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating my reconsideration had been denied. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted my case manager and after much discussion was told that my fax had never been received and I would have to open another reconsideration and resubmit documents either via fax or physical mail as email is not an option and she could not send them for me or reopen a reconsideration. I was told it is my responsibility to ensure documents are received, but did not have an advice as to how exactly I am supposed to do that since I am not given the contact details of the person reviewing my claim, or the department at all. Nor did she consider that it was a Wells Fargo employee that faxed the documents and at this point the document contents should be considered conferred to the claims and fraud department. She also could not explain why I was never contacted to provide substantiating documents except to say that COVID changed protocols. I expressed that I believe their process for claims equates to bad faith as it denies claims due to lack of substantiationg but then puts roadblocks in the way of substantiating and she said she agrees. After I told her that made them liable to me for failure to uphold their fiduciary duty to me, she backpedaled and said she only personally agrees and is still investigating. As an employee of Wells Fargo faxed the information to the fraud department and verbally affirmed to me that it was received, I believe Wells Fargo has failed in their duty to fairly and thoroughly investigate this fraud claim or has willfully chosen to ignore the facts and their actions are tantamount to illegal bad faith."
664,"A few days ago, I applied for a credit card. They did a credit check and immediately granted me a card with {$3000.00} line of credit. this small amount is meaningless to me and not worth having another company accessing my credit. Now, I don't even know what my card number is. I can't access them on the phone without a card number. I need to contact me about this credit limit and have no way of doing so. They accessed my credit information and now I have nothing in return. A {$3000.00} line of credit is meaningless."
665,"Mulitiple purchased made at XXXX furniture store. I am legally altered with vision. I relied upon store sales persons to inform me of the financing terms. I did sign an agreement via their little tiny printer that had writing on it that I could not read. The device I signed on was not much larger that a credit card swiper that you use at a grocery store. 

Purchases made on XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. 

I was told by sales person that I would have no interest purchase agreement with 12 months of payments. If the payments were not made I would get charged interest. I paid those payments without fail. I did not sit down to do the math because I had no reason to distrust Steinhafels at the time. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was charged {$200.00} in interest charges. I disputed this action with the complaint department at Wells Fargo, the financing company for the XXXX credit account. I received a letter from Wells Fargo Complaint division dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX indicating that if I paid a sum of {$280.00} the interest charges of {$200.00} would be waived. I paid Wells Fargo the sum of {$1900.00} on XX/XX/XXXX via my online bill pay. That sum was to pay off the {$280.00} sum to get the interest charges waived and also to pay off another purchase with no interest for 12 months that was expiring on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$1400.00}. Also, I added {$130.00} to make a monthly payment ( that was not due per their statement ). Wells Fargo make the decision not to pay off those expiring transaction but chose instead to divide that payment up among all of the purchases. Wells Fargo also changed the special terms ending date on the purchase with a balance of {$1400.00} from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and did not pay that balance off as I indicated. A person from the complaint department called me on XXXX XXXX ( I think was the date ) and explained that she would get in touch with billing to get this issue resolved if she could and would call me back the next day. She did not call back. However, during our conversation she did tell me that Wells Fargo billing had in the purchase agreement ways that payments were applied. As shown to you in clear print, apparently Wells Fargo will not allow you to pay off purchases but rather redirect payments how they choose. Additionally, the {$280.00} that I did pay apparently did resolve the interest charge of {$200.00} but they would not enter that fact on the new statement they mailed to me. I did see that credit online via their website but again, will not reflect the credit on the actual billing statement. I do not believe this to be ethical business practices. Furthermore, why would the company finance 12 months no interest if paid if full by that date, set the payment charges to a level that will not pay off the debt in 12 months, then not allow you to pay the debt off but rather divide the payment as they choose. This is clearly a consumer trap that should be addressed and punished."

Wells Fargo SEEMED to understand the details of the deception the merchant created in trying to secure payment for a much cheaper inferior item I did not order. I today [ XX/XX/2022 ] received notice my wells fargo credit card company closed my dispute in favor of the merchant because the company provided a tracking #. I never said I never received a delivery with the tracking # provided to me but I did not receive anything remotely close to the item that was ordered by me. I believe wells fargo did not investigate my dispute for the reasons I detailed to them in my original statement and feel they are NOT protecting me as a consumer for fraudulent/ deceitful acts by a corrupt merchant. wells fargo does have relevant pictures and documents of original order and deceptive shipment that was sent to me."

Wells Fargo offered more, but that's all the credit I felt I needed. Wells Fargo asked for a personal guarantee which was to be faxed to a number they provided. I faxed this signed personal guarantee. 

Shortly thereafter I received letters, calls and emails requesting the personal guarantee. In response to this I faxed the personal guarantee two more times. 

I also tried calling Wells Fargo, and it was impossible to get through to anyone, sometimes waiting on hold for more than 1 hour. 

Finally, I tried sending an email about this through their online system, and I received back a message not addressing my inquiry, but apologizing for long hold times on the phone, and that I should again try to reach them by phone. I wrote back complaining that they did not address my question. 

Shortly thereafter I received a letter saying that I was not approved for the card based on negative information on my credit report. 

This was a colossal waste of time, and I'm upset that I applied and was approved for a card and provided the personal guarantee as they requested but then did not get the card. It seems that once I complained about their service they decided they would not offer the card."

There might be a possibility that the transaction was made earlier but posted by merchant later.

I had paid the account in order to purchased a home but I need this fraudulent closed account removed from my credit report. I shouldn't continue to be impacted by Wells Fargo any more.
696,THERE IS A LATE PAYMENT OF 30 DAYS REPORTING ON MY ACCOUNT ON XXXX OF 2017. I WAS NEVER LATE FOR THIS ACCOUNT AND WOULD LIKE THE STATUS UPDATED.
698,"I had accumulated {$14.00} in 'Rewards cash ' on a Wells Fargo CC , but while the account was still open, I no longer had an actual card to actively use the account. In XX/XX/2019, I received a letter from WF informing me that - if I did not use the card again within a specific time frame ( 60 days or so, I believe ) - WF would close the account and upon closure, I would lose the reward I had accumulated. 

Over the next several months, I called WF at least twice and sent numerous emails requesting that a card be sent to me. WF did send me a CC, but it was attached to another account I had with WF. I informed them of their error, and asked again that they send a CC for the account in question, and that they not close the account without first doing so. 

WF never sent me a CC and - in spite of their promise not to close the account when I specifically requested that they not close it - the account was closed and my rewards cash 'disappeared '. Subsequent emails requesting this error be corrected have been answered with denials of wrongdoing and rejection of my request. 

WF also uses an 'in house ' email system with customers that deletes emails after a short time frame. All emails with WF are now deleted from their proprietary system. 

I would like to be reimbursed the money that - according to our contract - I earned through purchases."
699,"Hi, Someone made purchases using my Wells Fargo credit card for over {$10000.00}. This consists of a total of 9 fraudulent transactions made at an XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX on XX/XX/2021. ( I live in XXXX, XXXX and have not been to XXXX, XXXX in several years! ) I have notified Wells Fargo and they are investigating. Could you please look into this matter as well. I am attaching the Wells Fargo statement showing these 9 fraudulent transactions made on XX/XX/2021. I am also attaching a report I made to XXXX Police on the same issue. Thank you and looking forward to hearing from you on this. 

Best, XXXX XXXX Phone : XXXX Email : XXXX XXXX"
701,"XXXX : Case Number : XXXX The issue is that I did not then, and still do not now have either an ATM or a Debit card that allows me to withdraw money from my account while I am overseas. So XXXX XXXX has totally missed the point. 

While it is correct that I don't have a US phone number to which the Bank could send me the one-time code, that is not the issue. My issue is that the bank needs to have ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS IN PLACE so that customers who find themselves in the position that I am in, are able, by some other means than having a US phone number, STILL be able to get an ATM or Debit card while overseas. 

Furthermore, It is TOTALLY UNREASONABLE for the bank to take the position that the only way that this deficiency in their system could be resolved, is for me to return to the USA in order to get an ATM/Debit card. These observations are made in view of the fact that : Firstly : All reports suggest that currently, in the USA, the impact of COVID 19 and its variants is quite severe, therefore I do not want to return to the USA under these specific circumstances Secondly : However, The cost of returning to the USA is price prohibitive. 

Thirdly : The bank needs to have systems in place that customers in my position could use. 

Fourthly : When during my conversation with the CSR on XXXX XX/XX/2020 I had asked for the issue to be escalated upwards that was because there were no avenues for resolution with that CSR. I also found out that the bank could not even send me an XXXX XXXX, which would have been an alternative means by which the bank could verify my identity. So it is clear that XXXX XXXX who reviewed the complaint did not do a thorough review of the matter. 

Yes, I did ask for the matter to be escalated upwards as I was not getting any satisfaction. Hence the length of time spent on trying to resolve the matter. This extended time on the phone was as a result of the Bank 's inefficiency to adequately resolve the matter. Hence, under these circumstances, it is normal for the Bank to compensate me for the long time that I needed to spend on the phone with the various members of their staff. 

Lastly I also ask that the Bank communicates with me about this matter through my email address and not by mail through my XXXX XXXX address which is very expensive for me to Retrieve any correspondence sent to me there."
702,"On XX/XX/XXXX, a gentlemen offered to pay XXXX off my Wells Fargo credit card for I can be approved for a loan. Using the credit card information I gave him, he use Wells Fargo check by phone system to make the payment. 
He instructed me to pay him back the next day by gift cards. Wells Fargo credited the amount to my credit card and I completed the task using the credit card. He attemped it again for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, but the bank froze the payment. Both payments bounced. 
I contacted Wells Fargo to explain what happened and they kept ignoring the fact that they credited me a bad check for I could make the purchases. 
There was no grace time, my account was credited within hours of receiving the payment. They check purchases, but not the payment. All my other payments was transfered from my Wells Fargo checking account. I spoke to someone and she said there was no safety protocols to prevent fake payments."
704,"Wells Fargo is charging nusisance fees on my interest free card marketed as a balance transfer card. I am still within the zero interest period. BTW the bank places the onus on me to recall what the period is and DO NOT issue timely reminders. Oh "" great '' customer service, right? 

They refuse to reverse the current fee. This from an institution that has been assessed serious penalty for phantom accounts. Now they are trying phantom transactions under the noses of customers who like myself have been with them for over 20 years when they were Wachovia. 

The agreement is "" interest free '' I only pay the balance and DO NOT incur any transaction fees since I DO NOT and HAVE NOT made any purchases that would incur an interest charge. 

On its face this is a violation of state and federal banking regulations and please tell other consumers by way of this complaint to watch out."
707,XXXX $ was stolen out of my bank account on XX/XX/2021 Ive been trying to dispute this claim for 40 days now every time I get this escalated Ive been give the ring around transferred have been on hold for more than an hr each time all for Wells Fargo to push my claim Out and start the process all over again. They tell me the claims officer working my case isnt available or is out for the day and its frustrating please help me.
708,Wells Fargo closed my business account without notifying me or providing a reason why. I made payments EVERY single month. When I called the representative had a hard time finding my files. They refused to reopen my account and was very nasty and discriminated against me because of my nationality it was absolutely no reason for them to close my business account
709,"I used a XXXX issued by Wells Fargo to pay a fence company for services rendered. The XXXX said that I would be charged 5 % of the amount for which the check was written. 
I wrote the check for {$3200.00} for which I would be charged a fee of {$160.00}. When I went on to look at my statement, it showed {$3500.00} owed. I called the fence company to see if I accidentally made the check out for the wrong amount to which I did not. 
I called Wells Fargo 3 x 's to try to remedy this and they told me that the fence company charged me an additional {$300.00} for paying by XXXX. I called the fence company back to ask them if that was the case, IT WAS NOT THE CASE. 
Wells Fargo has charged me an additional {$300.00} and will not correct this issue. 
I believe they are perpetrating fraud on my account to get more fees!!"
711,"In XX/XX/XXXX all XXXX of my children were diagnosed with XXXX. Our only source of income, my small business, was forced to be shut down for the entire month to comply with governor 's orders. I called Wells Fargo to ask for a 2 month deferment which was verbally granted by the woman I spoke with. I was so grateful. Then in XX/XX/XXXX I saw that the deferment was not processed. I called Wells Fargo to discuss. The gentleman I spoke to said that there was a mistake and he would pass this along to the manager to remedy but the manager was out at the time. Nothing was communicated with us until I called to follow up on XX/XX/XXXX when I spoke to XXXX from the Executive Office. She said that XXXX ( Wells Fargo employee ) would be calling me in 48 hours. No one called. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I called again and spoke to XXXX. She had said that now XXXX was assigned to our case but he was away from his phone and he would be calling us back ASAP. No one called. Then on XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter saying that XXXX XXXX was working on our case and we should expect a response by XX/XX/XXXX. There was no response. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to XXXX. She said that XXXX was unavailable but that he mailed a letter our asking for more time until XX/XX/XXXX. Then on XX/XX/XXXX we received another letter once again asking for more time until XX/XX/XXXX. Then on XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX that there was a "" delay in processing your request for COVID-19 payment assistance '' and that they processed & corrected. Finally after many months Wells Fargo Executive Offices can see what we've been saying all along. HOWEVER, they DID NOT remove any late fees or delinquent payments to our account from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with XXXX XXXX on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX and asked him to please remove these fees and delinquent payments because we were simply waiting on Wells Fargo to get back to us on the case. He informed me that he would not do that even though no one ever informed us from the executive office that we needed to make payments while they were working on the case. So what has happened is Wells Fargo made a mistake, took 6 months to remedy that mistake and has racked up late fees and damaged OUR credit in the meantime. Wells Fargo has actually MADE MONEY off of a woman small business owner while trying to keep my doors open and raise XXXX small children in a pandemic."
714,"Since XXXX, I have had a Wells Fargo Visa credit card and have made all payments promptly and on time. 

When I received my XXXX bill, I wrote out a brokerage account check for the entire amount of {$9100.00} and mailed it on XXXX. It was paid on XXXX 

After receiving a text message from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/ indicating that my payment was not received, I asked an employee at my brokerage account to provide Wells Fargo 's Payment Research Department with documentation showing that the check was paid. 
I then received a letter from Wells Fargo dated XXXX indicating that "" after completing the investigation on this matter, we have determined that our records are correct and the status off your account is accurate. '' On XX/XX/, I asked the same employee at my brokerage account to provide a copy of the canceled check ( front and back ) to XXXX XXXX at Wells Fargo 's XXXX XXXX.

Credit Card Wells Fargo still refused to accept them and declined my identity for confirmation and card approval. Again this XX/XX/XXXX they approached me same reason of the decline of the card application : Identity can't be verified. I called Credit Card Department at Wells Fargo and they asked me to accept their passcode text that is not available on home phone. I asked them to send security code through SMS but they refused. I asked Wells Fargo Credit Card Department for alternative option to send a security code by email or text message or another way by mail. They refused. I provided my identification and additional documents at Wells Fargo branch office. Wells Fargo Credit Card still declined them. Their same reason : Identity can't be verified. I believe that they are doing abusive process and already burden the process and blocked me as a consumer for equal consideration and options for solutions. I believe that they discriminated me."

After the landscaping was installed, I immediately set up auto payment with my bank to ensure the final payment would be made on XX/XX/XXXX with the first payment submitted on XX/XX/XXXX. Payments were made like clockwork on the XXXX of every month thereafter. I did not check my account again until XX/XX/XXXX when I noticed every month I was receiving a late fee and interest. I immediately called Wells Fargo and they indicated that because I made my payment every month one day prior to the billing cycle opening date every payment is considered late. At that point they agreed to remove all late fees and interest due to the fact I was unaware my payments were being made early. I then moved my payment date forward with my bank to avoid the same issue moving forward. I have since been checking my account every month to ensure the fees have been removed. It is now XXXX XXXX and some of my fees have been removed but there is still a fee balance of {$210.00}. I have made 3 additional calls to Wells Fargo pleading my case but I am now running into road blocks and my feeling is that Wells Fargo no longer intends to work with me. I explained to the bank that from my history it should be pretty obvious that I am not trying to game the system here and I should not be penalized for making my payments early every month.

718,"Wells Fargo Business Platinum Card ending in XXXX:Over limit fee of $XXXX was charged to my account on the following dates: XX/XX/19, XX/XX/19, XX/XX/19, XX/XX/19 & XX/XX/19 for a total of $XX/XX/XXXXI Contacted WF on XX/XX/19: CSR (female didn’t get her name) looked into it and I was told that this was standard fee for going over the limit. I asked if I could remove that feature and was told no. It was explained that my option was to pay closer attention to daily balance, make more frequent payment(s), and/or use a different card. I then informed her (WF csr) that I never opted in (knowingly) nor received any confirmation of such an opt-in; which is require by the Credit Card Act of 2009. At this point the CSR promptly offered to refund 2 of 5 the fees. I explained there was 5 and she said she would refer me to another dept at this point.WF Customer ??? dept CSR XXXX took over and I explained the situation to him. I did also request some proof that I knowingly opted-in and that WF sent confirmation regarding the over limit fee. He said he would look into this and get with his supervisor. He came back on the phone and asked what months had the over limit fee so he could get approval to get them refunded/reversed. After 5 mins or so on hold he came back on the phone and stated he was able to get all 5 reversed. I did ask again about the opt-in proof. He was unable to provide any info that I had opted-in or that confirmation was sent. Seemed eager to want to make this situation go away. Prior to ending the call he did inform me that he was sending this matter to the WF Executive Offices / Case Management (Case ID: XXXX) and I should hear back from them in a few days. I did ask one last time to opt-out but he wasn’t aware of any way to do that and the case manager should be able to help.I find this practice to be very shady and unethical. It feels as though they (WF) are banking on busy customers like me to miss those fees when reviewing statement charges and hoping to get away with generating income off of falsely charged fees. It’s kind of like begging for forgiveness over asking for permission."
725,"I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found 30 days late payment on the date XX/XX/2017. I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."

I wondered ho this happened since I set up auto pay. I called and a rep refunded the fee of XXXX. I looked at my new bill and saw a {$40.00} fee. I called and they said it was because my bank rejected the payment. I saw that instead of taking out {$150.00} on the due date, there was a XXXX payment that was taken out on the XXXX of XXXX Then there was a payment for XXXX on the XXXX of XXXX Then there was a returned payment fee of XXXX on the XXXX which baffled me because on the summary of account activity, it shows the payment of XXXX. I have more than enough in the bank to pay this bill and only had the line of credit opened in order to build credit, but am mad at myself for doing business with XXXX because I had a horrible past experience. 
When I called XXXX, I was told it was my bank 's fault and I needed to call them. It appears that Wells Fargo is back to it's past practices of scamming myself and millions of others out of their money. 
I paid off the account immediately due to my disgust and closed it but omitted the XXXX fee. I told them I am NOT going to pay this and I am going to have them investigated."

730,"Wells Fargo decreased my credit limit based on a recent update to my credit. I have never had a late payment and have made large lump payments in the past. They did not warn me about the change and it is also going to impact my score by increasing my debt to credit limit ratio. This is egregious behavior in their part because they are causing a "" double hit '' on my score. I wast even made aware of the change until I tried to use the card for car repairs."

732,"I repeatedly have issues opening a credit card account despite the fact that all of my previous accounts are closed and paid in full. Every time I apply for a line of credit the credit card companies deny my application and try to force me to open a high interest card with a low limit. These cards serve very little purpose for me because they constantly report as maxed out ( regardless of whether they are paid in full every month ) because of the low limit therefore actually hurting my credit score more than helping it and they do not extend enough available credit to actually serve any purpose in an emergency. 
The other problem that I have is that without a decent line of credit I'm having trouble qualifying for a mortgage. The banks are reluctant to lend when they know that a consumer may have trouble maintaining the home in the event that something breaks and funding for the repair becomes an issue. 
In my most recent attempt to obtain credit with Wells Fargo XXXX. the bank stated that the reason for the denial of credit was too many delinquencies and too many accounts open with revolving balances. I have issues with these reasons because the delinquencies that they are referring too are on accounts that not only have perfect payment history for periods up to XXXX years prior to the delinquencies, but also have been paid in full and closed since those delinquencies. The cluster of delinquencies in 2019 were a result of an automobile accident in which my employer did not have proper insurance and I was left injured and without income for two-to-three months. However, my accident is not the problem, it's just another example of how useless these banks have become. The problem is that in the last decade banks have started to follow an alarming trend to generate revenues in which they ignore their fiduciary responsibility to consumers and begin to self-cannibalize off of their own customers during the time in which they can actually justify their existence such as an emergency when a credit card could be useful. This dependency on fees results in fraud such as the above-mentioned scenario in which the bank tried to force me into a product that is designed for fee harvesting. So instead of finding ways to generate new business, they're destroying people financially and swindling them out thousands in late interest and fees making it impossible for them to recover. 
Lastly, the other issue that I have is that it's been almost three years since these "" delinquencies '' and all of my bills have been paid on time since then. So, since the system is designed as such that consumers are dependent on financial vehicles such as credit cards it is absurd for the banks to continue to slander me for such an extended period of time not only violating my privacy rights but also harassing me trying to generate fee revenue for each other."
734,"Wells Fargo account XXXX I would like for your company to provide me a copy of your compliance and procedures of conducting an investigation. Because I believe that you are reporting false credit reporting to the bureaus! I asked of you to review the files and please explain to me in great details of how did you come up with what you claim you Certified on your company letterhead dated XX/XX/2022! You stated to the CFPB and myself that account number XXXX And I quote!! 

Dear XXXX XXXX : We received your complaint on XX/XX/2022, regarding your credit bureau reporting. We have completed our research and would like to share our findings. 
Credit reporting As a fair and responsible lender, Wells Fargo is required to report factual and accurate information to the credit bureaus under the Fair Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Our records confirm, we are reporting this account to all credit reporting agencies as "" XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  '' As a result, we are not able to make a goodwill! My question to you was how did you verify that this information was was reporting correctly on your end? Because XXXX was not showing the information on there credit files! As included in XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo if it was reporting correctly using factual based dispute methods and provided it to you? why? 
Keep in mind the date of XX/XX/2022 in which you stated you received the complaint/ dispute and provided an updated to XXXX XXXX 30 days went by the account was still not displaying included! So XXXX XXXX I disputed again with XXXX as you can see they stated We have research the credit account account number # XXXX The results are this account is not currently reporting include it in XXXX  on your XXXX credit file. The following fields have been modified! XXXX, XXXX Wells Fargo they indicated that the account was not reporting as included in XXXX! 

XXXX Wells Fargo I advised you XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that the account was not included in XXXX  but you lied and claim that you verified your records and show that it was included! I have told you now XXXX has told you! That it wasnt! 
XXXX so back to my prior question to you we both had and have told you over and over again how did you correct or updated something that wasnt there?? This is false credit reporting on your behalf! After a 117 days later it finally gets on the credit report is why Im requesting your company compliance guidelines and procedures on your investigations for the FCRA. Again XXXX have said there was nothing reporting which makes sense because why would I dispute if it was there?? So this leaves nobody but you Wells Fargo who have told a lied. Since this matter is stuck with nobody but your doing I asked that you remove this false credit reporting that you have done from the get go. You failed to conduct a proper investigation within 30 days violation of CRA and I want it removed legal actions gon na come you should be ashamed of yourself the facts are here! You are acting willful and reckless with your reporting! 

Please EXPLAIN HOW CAN YOU UPDATE SOMETHING THATS NOT EVEN THERE? This is funny lol"
735,"I lost my job and had a hard time paying off my credit card. I tried to resolve this by contacting Wells Fargo but they never responded or helped me. Eventually they let charges stack well past my actual credit limit and then sued me for collections. 

A lot of mistakes and over charges were happening which compounded the issue even further."
736,"I am filing a complaint on Wells Fargo for the way my payment was handled and reported on for XX/XX/2020 and XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX  for continuing to report the inaccuracy. Details are in the cover page attached, with all supporting documents. 10 pages plus 1 Fax confirmation page to was to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2020. 
I made my Wells Fargo payment with ACH over the phone, Wells Fargo rep confirmed payment was successful. Payment was returned for an unknown reason over a week later, Wells Fargo didnt give me a reason why. The day I noticed the return, I called to pay again, was told payment was successful by Wells Fargo rep. Later that night I noticed the payment returned again for an unknown reason. I had more than enough in the account to cover the payment. The following day, I mailed a check made to Wells Fargo in the amount of {$300.00}. Check was cashed 5 days later, around that time I received a letter from Wells Fargo confirming my second ACH payment was successful, which led me to believe they tried processing it again and it went through. This all started 2 days after my XX/XX/2020 payment was due. That payment would be 30+ days past due is paid on or after XX/XX/2020. Wells Fargo confirmation letter was dated XX/XX/2020 and my check was cashed XX/XX/2020. All done before the 30 day mark. Unfortunately, it turns out, the 2nd ACH payment wasnt successful and the check I mailed to Wells Fargo wasnt cashed by Wells Fargo, it was lost/stolen during delivery. I put more than a reasonable effort to make that payment and reporting a 30 day late on my credit is an inaccurate representation of my financial responsibility and credit worthiness. I dont think Wells Fargo even looked at what I sent them because they refused to stop reporting the late payment, stating that they are federal law requires them to report accurately, 15 U.S. Code Sec 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 7 ) ( E ) Responsibilities of furnishers of information "" No provision of this paragraph shall be construed as requiring a financial institution that has provided a customer with a notice described in subparagraph ( A ) to furnish negative information about the consumer to a consumer reporting agency, I also included several links from XXXX that state neither the Credit Bureaus nor any federal or state law requires data furnishers to report information. Not only are they reporting inaccurate information, they are trying to justify it by providing me inaccurate information. On the same letter they say "" If you believe that information as been reported inaccurately, you can send us a letter describing the specific information you are disputing and why you are disputing it. In your letter include ... .as well as any supporting documentation you may have. '' They are responding to that exact letter I sent them and telling me to send them a letter. Its obvious neither my letter or my supporting documents were looked at and this was done by an automated verification process. No reasonable person who read my letter and considered all the supporting documents would argue that this late payment was my fault. I made a reasonable request and received an unreasonable response back. I prefer to handle this matter without getting the court involved but if Wells Fargos willful negligence continues, I wouldn't hesitate to seek legal action against Wells Fargo and 3 major credit bureaus, ENCLOSURES : Fax Confirmation page, cover letter sent to Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo Confirmation of payment, Front of check XXXX before sending, Back of check XXXX before sending, Page 1 XXXX  XXXX XXXX Business Checking ending XXXX, Page 7 XXXX  XXXX XXXX Business Checking Checks section, Page 8 XXXX XXXX XXXX Business Checking Checks continued, Page 11 XXXX XXXX XXXX Business Checking Check images."

However, a few days later a bank rep called me and said the case has been closed because the complaint was about service at a hotel that I stayed in. apparently, it seemed that they had no investigation at all and probably did me a favor by taking the complaint over the phone, to make it seem as if they tried doing something about it. Still, I tried explaining to the rep what exactly took place and the zero service and accommodations at the hotelto no avail ; she was resolute that nothing will change with the case. She said that since I stayed in the hotel, I cant dispute the charge and I should bite the bullet basically Afterwards, after pleading for a supervisor on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, listened to all the details and said that the case will be reopened and investigated. Interestingly, she didnt mention a word about the so called issue they had with disputing a charge of a hotel service that I remained in. importantly, I clarified the following issues I had : I asked the hotel clerk before checking in if theres a quiet room, and they gave me a room on the XXXX floor, which was supposed to be quiet. But it turned out ( I didnt know its so bad in XXXX XXXX XXXX that music was so loud, that it felt like a boom box was in my room. How could I ever imagine such a scenario on a XXXX floor where music would keep me up all night. Additionally, there was no hot water at XXXX. Worse, I guess since its XXXX XXXX and they have more important things to deal with, like gambling customersno one took guest services calls. Essentially, I had to go down 17 floors whenever I wanted something. And when I asked the hotel clerk in the morning if I can get a refund if I leave the hotel, they said no way. They said they will fix the hot water issue; oh, and the noise, they said it should be quiet the second night. And yes you guessed it : the second night was all same noise Clearly, I explained to XXXX, even if I get paid to stay at a hotel like this, I would never stay there. And maybe this is precisely the problem with hotels? They know very well the rule of disputing charges at a hotelwhich is basically that if you stay at the hotel and dont leave, the bank cant refund the money to the consumer? Essentially, why would they want to have guest services, if they make millions at the casino? Ultimately, the small costumer is the one who loses with this flawed rule ( which makes no sense at all ). Naturally, I was stuck and could leave the hotel either, but suffered in vein for two days. 
Sadly, when I called back and got XXXX on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX told me the case was never opened again. To my dismay, I explained to XXXX again the whole situation and what the issue is and that XXXX promised to reopen the case on XX/XX/XXXX. Shocking but not surprising all my talking and please fell on deaf ears. After being on the phone for half an hour, all XXXX can say was that a supervisor will call me back ( as if they are really trying to be helpful this time and only want to improve the lives of their customers ; I get it wells fargo ). Sure enough, no one ever called me back. Needless to say, the emotional roller coaster that followed with agents hanging up phones on me and promises of managers calling back Generally speaking, the utter disgust when talking to a bank like wells Fargo about disputing a charge of such a small amount, took me in to a different universe -- which is a world of lies, greed and total disregard for facts and fairness. Never have I experienced this level of crookedness by a bank where all they want to do is manipulate the consumer with excuses and contradictionsall to discourage people from disputing charges. Indeed, I never knew that banks live and breath by money. And the million dollar question is : why is a greedy bank like wells Fargo allowed to sell their service to a small consumer like me who is not equipped to fight them? Shouldnt there be some rules implemented against these banks who have no intention of being ethical and siding with their customers? 
Finally, after weeks of calling and getting no where, I tried again this week and was able to explain my case again to XXXX, but she seemed frustrated by the complexity of the problem as well. And she said that as much as she wants to help me, she cant. And I asked her the following question : What happens, for example, if someone buys a laptop and after a few days it breaks. Will a bank say that since the laptop was used for a few days and not returned right away, there can be no request for a refund? Why is it that when someone stays at a hotel, which turns out ( after being in the room for 12 hours ) thats its uninhabitable and worthlessthat person cant dispute the charge? And if the hotel doesnt want to give a refund, and theres no where to go at a late hour of XXXX, how can you penalize a person so harshly? And maybe as I mentioned earlier, this is the crux of the matter : the hotels know they can get away with it, so they feel no responsibility to provide proper service? 

This is simply a joke and unacceptable ; it needs to change"

749,"I have a XXXX 's credit card which is through Wells Fargo and can be used at other places. I let my husband purchase something online with my card as i was right beside him. He was logged in on his account and made purchases. When I received my bill, I asked him for a list of those charges to reconcile against the statement. When he went into his account to look at the orders, he saw all my past purchases including many that he shouldn't have. I immediately called the credit card company and they filed a report which is Case # XXXX. I asked that it be immediately fixed or shut off so he couldn't view anything. I have not heard anything back from them and would like the issue to be escalated. Luckily it was just my husband who saw the information that I am aware of but I don't know that for sure. I am the only authorized user on the card along with almost every other account I own. My finances are my own and I don't appreciate that they not only let him view everything but then haven't not fixed it."

I believe this did not happen by accident. What I suspect is that Wells Fargo is deliberately processing such transaction in order to charge their credit card customers and collect fraudulent fees."

756,"This is now my 2nd complained with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for this issue. I told you all last time Wells Fargo was intentionally lowering my credit limit due to a "" late payment '' on my credit card account which was due to covid and their call centers being closed. My account is current and has always been current. My credit history is perfect, but after this 1 late fee I called Wells Fargo multiple times, including their executive office, but they would not refuse the late fee. 

I then filed a complaint w/ theXX/XX/XXXX. After the XXXX XXXX XXXX investigation, Wells Fargo lowered my credit limit from {$11000.00} to {$8300.00}, then I filed a complaint with the CFPB. After that complaint, they lowered my credit limit to {$6400.00}. I then filed another complaint w/ the XX/XX/XXXX and what do you know, my credit limit has now been lowered to {$5100.00} which is RIGHT above my current balance of {$5000.00} as of this complaint. 

So now for the 3rd time, I've been intentionally targeted in having my credit limit lowered thus hurting my credit even more. I'd like to speak to someone at the CFPB or my next steps are to call my Congressman because Wells Fargo at this point is being CRIMINAL. I give the CFPB permission to pull my credit history, run a hard check if you must. You will see 0, I reiterate, 0 missed/late payments throughout my report. I have 12 active accounts, 0 issues EXCEPT for WellsFargo. 

I'm looking to have the late payment removed from my credit report, and would like to know my options at this point for pressing charges as this is obviously DELIBERATE attacking of my credit at this point."

But my compliant is that why they did not mention this as exclusion during the application. There is a citizen status question on the application webpage and I chose alien resident.

I inquired as to why I wasn't being refunded the entire {$500.00}, I was informed that because I paid the overdraft fees in the past, I basically accepted the overdraft protection fees. I informed the agent that I had several accounts with the bank and that when a person sees there account in the negative, they pay the outstanding fees and that's all I did. I never knew, agreed to, or was aware that I was paying overdraft fees or that my secured credit was being charged these fees because I never activated the card."

Wells fargo shipped the credit card to my old address on file rather than the address I gave them during my application. They actually sent my debit card to the correct address they just mailed all of the credit card stuff to the wrong address.

783,"I have been disputing a scam with Wells Fargo since XX/XX/XXXX. They have done absolutely nothing to protect me as a consumer and are looking to profit off of the interest earned from scam. 

A merchant was able to scam and double charge me by running my credit card multiple times until wells blocked transaction. The merchant told me that I needed to accept the transaction and then sign a new receipt because of this. This resulted in me being double charged {$3600.00}. 

When disputing this with Wells I was told because I signed receipt I had to call the merchant. After I spoke to merchant and they refused to reverse the double charge I realized I was being scammed. I escalated within Wells Fargo. 

The person on the escalation team said to me on a recorded line that I was scammed ( apparently the scam is portrayed in some movie she saw. Seemed excited to talk about it ). However because I signed the receipt there was nothing they could do. I continued to submit new evidence to support the fact I was scammed such as XXXX XXXX, obvious forgery of my signature on the invoices provided by merchant, XXXX reviews of other being scammed the same way. They continued to tell me I needed to provide new info and there was nothing they could do. 

After that I called XXXX XXXX to report the scam but they told me there's nothing they could do and need to call the bank. I reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX but the XXXX lawyer they referred me to wouldn't even talk to me. I reached out to multiple lawyers and have not even received a response. 

After months of striking out trying to get help reversing the charge I decided to just cut my losses and pay the charge. I have had perfect credit my whole life and this transaction sitting there is destroying my credit. I don't have the cash but I was going to borrow against my XXXX or withdraw from ira to pay it. 

I reached out to Wells to try and settle. At a minimum I wanted to reverse the interest earned while disputing this transaction. I have been unable to discuss it with anyone. When I ask to escalate the situation the person never discusses what we are escalating, who we are escalating to, why we are escalating, what the potential outcomes could be. I have offered to pay all of the original transaction amounts. However I have yet to speak to anybody who could actually make that decision. Even though I have made every payment to them across multiple lines of credit over 10 years. 

Wells fargo has done nothing to protect me as a consumer, a victim, and a customer to their institution. Any steps they have taken were just checking a box to prevent further action from gov entities. There has been XXXX actual help or concern demonstrated. In fact without their text alert system this scam would not have been possible.

I flagged these transactions as disputes which Wells Fargo immediately provided refunds for with an extra credit of {$11.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I owed the bank {$11.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, there were both a charge and a credit of {$99.00} on my card so no change to how much I owed. 

I was sent a new card in the following days and all fraud charges and credits were transferred to the new card and the {$11.00} that I previously owed was also charged back to the bank. So by end of XXXX, everything balanced. There was nothing that the bank or I owed to each other.

On XX/XX/20, I initiated contact through Wells Fargo 's message center.

The least sophisticated consumer in this case would likely have taken Wells Fargo at their word and assumed the charge would be reversed. This would have created a situation where the account would continue to roll forward in delinquency and impact the customer. This is an unfair or deceptive practice. It's preying on unsuspecting consumers, many of which are experiencing a terrible time financially. It just so happens I actively use and pay the account and have monitored the situation.

Though WellsFargo Fraud Dept. acknowledged my call-in alert, but how they came about doing it, was unacceptable : I've had a cellphone alert on my acct. for transaction of > {$10.00}, but they never sent me a text.

However he next day, login again, I saw fraudulent transactions dated day before their email sent to me. 
WellsFargo seems to have contributed to this fraud : 1. Should have sent me a cellphone alert on the date a replacement card was requested by the fraudster.

2. An email should also have been sent on the same date the Fraudster asked for a replacement.

3. Replacement card mailing to a different address should have heightened suspicion of fraud, instituting a prolonged mailing until cleared with cellphone & email contact response.

800,"I accepted an 18 month 0 interest balance transfer promotion from Wells Fargo on my credit card in XXXX, XXXX. 

I called to confirm that I could still use my credit card to my regular purchases and that any payments that I would make would go towards the purchases not the balance transfer amount. They assured me that yes. And they said "" The payments will always go towards the highest interest balance '' When I called the last month to make a full payment on the purchases ( and the minimum on the balance transfer ) I was told that they had - for the past several months - applied my payments 50 % to balance transfer 50 % to purchases. They explained that they had a 0 % on purchases promotion on my card ( which was unbeknownst to me, and they never told me when I called previously ). 

They then explained that the 0 % on purchases was a 6 month promotion that would expire in XXXX and I would owe the full amount of purchases then or be charged interest. 

I asked them to go back and apply all of my previous payments towards my purchases, since my balance transfer goes until XXXX XXXX and they said they ca n't. 

I believe this is an issue of structuring to harm the consumer. 

I accepted / opted in an 18 month promotion, but they gave me a 0 % on purchases that I never opted in ( apparently via mail and I had to specifically opt out ). This promotion of 0 % for 6 months in effect makes it so I ca n't actually take advantage of the 18 month 0 %. Because payment allocation goes automatically 50 % and 50 % so I end up with a balance within the 7th month. 

I request that they retroactively apply my payments to my purchases balance vs. my balance transfer."

I sent a request for validation to Wells Fargo pursuant to 15 USC 1692 ( g ) requesting the information detailed within that section of the FDCPA in order for me to validate the alleged debt. They did not respond with those and therefore it is within my rights to state that this alleged "" debt '' is unvalidated and disputed. This alleged "" debt '' is not mine. Wells Fargo requested that I send them information before they send me the information I requested which is a direct violation of 15 USC 1692 ( g ). I sent this package on XX/XX/2022 and it was confirmed delivered XX/XX/2022."
808,"Hi, On XX/XX/XXXX I had 4 payments posted to my Visa Credit Card that were not made by me. {$930.00}, {$1.00}, {$1000.00} and {$5.00}. I mailed Visa a check for {$50.00} and another one for {$100.00} to go towards my Visa balance and that posted on XX/XX/XXXX as well. Wells Fargo is saying that another customer somehow made payments to my Visa account via check/mail from their checking account, but this isnt making any sense. They mailed me a refund check for {$860.00} because my account got messed up and they didnt know what was going on at the time. On XX/XX/XXXX the 4 payments not made by me were turned into Payment Reversals and the bank is saying I owe all this money back, with my current Visa balance totaling {$2300.00} ( that I owe that much $ ). I was not notified via mail on any of these matters by my bank after being reassured everything would be taken care of on their end. I was told I got a credit on my old Visa but that I no longer get a credit due to closing out my credit card and getting a new one per my banks request. No positive steps were recorded as taken by them, they went straight to Payment Reversal. Bank would not discuss this in person and on the phone were not helpful/nothing was resolved/was given no claim #. I called them multiple times for several weeks. Looking at my debit card account and Visa account none of this is adding up. I spoke to them on several occasions, including XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and others and they keep saying I owe my total Visa balance."
811,"This credit card account was paid in full in XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$410.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I unexpectedly had too file a Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy petition and this account had to be included according to my attorney. We later realized that payment has never processed to Wells Fargo for my credit card so the balance was included in my debt consolidation for the next 3-5 years. On XX/XX/XXXX In received notification that Wells Fargo has reported the status of this account as a "" charge off/ bad debt '' which resulted in a major decrease in my credit score. According to my Semi-Annual Report from the Chapter XXXX Trustee, the current balance now owed to Wells Fargo is {$22.00}. The amount reported is incorrect and the status and description of the account are completely INACCURATE.I am requesting that this account is deleted or updated."
813,"In XX/XX/2022 through a promotional offer, I accepted and applied for a VISA card at Wells Fargo Bank XXXX. This application led to an inquiry logged on my XXXX credit file, this resulted in my XXXX XXXX moving down from XXXX XXXX. 
I received an email from Wells Fargo giving me a reference number, XXXX, stating I should receive a card in 7 days or a reason for not granting me credit. 
Received a letter XXXX XXXX weeks later dated XXXX XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo stating that identity can't be verified, with same reference number and an XXXX # to call. 
I called the XXXX number and a XXXX said send a Government ID, and proof of residence to XXXX. This representative from Wells was talking to another person as we were disconnecting and stated that she was telling some old man to send documents and saying he thinks he is going to get a card, laughing as disconnection finished. That same day I faxed my USA Passport, my XXXX utility bill and my XXXX cable bill. The faxed was confirmed received by Wells Fargo XXXX. 

Again I faxed the same XXXX # on XXXX XX/XX/2022 asking about my application and requesting an answer, yes or no. To this day, XXXX XX/XX/2022 I have heard nothing from Wells Fargo, and I believe this is a overt act of discrimination as well as disparate treatment of a senior citizen. 
XXXX XXXX"
814,Wells Fargo refused to approve my credit card application after it was proven by a representative that I shouldve been approved but they still denied it
815,Unfair business Practices never let me establish a line of credit for my business
816,"I applied for the WF Cash Wise Credit Card and got approved on the same day. After 5 business days, I received the credit card and tried to activate it online but it will not let me so I called the number on the front of the card. I was told that that I had ti visit a branch in order to activate it. This was a surprise to me as I had never have to go to a bank branch to activate any credit card for the past 30+ years. I XXXX the WF credit card online and was surprised how many complaints this company had over this card. Anyway, I called up the next day, lunchtime, and spoke with XXXX, and asked her to close my account as I am not longer interested in using it. To my amazement, she told me that I am not able to close the card as I had to go to the branch to close it. I am fuming mad by this deceptiveness and want to file a complaint to this bank so that everyone can see what a big scam this is."
819,"I attempted to make the payment over the phone twice with debit card and was told both times that i had to use a checking account number ( which i dont have checks so I didnt have that info ) finally I contacted my bank and got my account and routing numbers and made a payment on the phone. 
A few weeks go by and i get a statement that say i owe {$640.00} minimum payment and Im late so i call in and come to find out they wrote my bank account info down wrong and so after i was credited for the payment they uncredited it which put me behind without my knowledge. They, at that point, took payment on my debit card stating since you are behind we are allowed to take a debit card Ive tried since with no luck to pay with my debit card being told you are current so we cant take debit card Ive since, with the help of a family member set up auto pay online so they cant pull that on me again."
820,"To whom it concerns, Wells Fargo and Company still have not addressed the concerns which I have reported more than 3 times now on the same issue. There was an Account for a Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX card, Which I applied for. In XXXX of XXXX, and through several different transactions, Fraud had occurred on the card. I had reported the Fraud right away as soon as I was able to determine that fraud had occurred. The card was stolen when my wallet was stolen, and I did not authorize any purchases in XXXX, XXXX or XXXX, for that matter on the card. Someone had used the card for unauthorized transactions, This was in the sum of almost {$28000.00} USD. Once I notified Wells Fargo, I was never contacted again I did call back several times on this same issue to see if someone could address the fraud with me, Wells Fargo stated they concluded an investigation and have determined It was my liability for the Fraud even though Wells Fargo, Knew I didn't have the card in my possession and states they have a {$0.00} Fraud liability policy. This issue is still ongoing. Wells Fargo recharged the card all of the fraudulent transactions, I have reached out to a few of these merchants on what I could see from the statements, a few of them being XXXX XXXX, and XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I asked the company via email if they had ever seen me use any of these apps, and gave them some of my information. The Company 's replied back saying I do not have an account on these platforms and that I never had. I sent an email back advising that Wells Fargo has numerous fraudulent charges from their company on my credit card statements during the fraudulent transaction period. XXXX told me Wells Fargo never sent them any documentation on the fraud, or they would have been more than willing to cooperate in the investigation. Wells Fargo didn't address my concerns in the last complaint and instead tried charging me a minimum payment due of {$2800.00} Which is absolutely absurd and due to the fraud they never corrected. I have tried reporting this numerous times by calling in and it never gets investigated. Per the last solution from Wells Fargo they told me because i made a payment to the account that I am responsible for the fraud. I do not believe this is a proper resolution. Wells Fargo then, Closed the Card as of Saturday XXXX/XXXX/2020, Without even contacting me to RESOLVE THE FRAUD that still is on the card and still billed to the card. When I spoke to a personal banker they advised I should definitely dispute this as if someone used the card fraudulently I shouldn't be liable for the fraud, and wells fargo prematurely reported it to the credit bureaus as deliquent and closed the card, without even cancelling the fraudulent transactions that I DID NOT COMPLETE. I am more than willing to send in an Affidavit if wells fargo requests one."
821,"I was in the XXXX last XX/XX/XXXX and around XX/XX/XXXX when I noticed a fraud transaction on my card last XX/XX/XXXX & XXXX, XXXX. A total purchase Of {$2100.00}. l called Wells Fargo Long distance around third week of XXXX weeks after the transaction, it took awhile for me to notice the fraud because I never ever use this credit card when I am abroad, and I didnt have any transaction on this card for a long while thats why I was even wondering how come they authorize this transaction even the purchase was more than my credit limit. I was expecting that this credit card company should decline any purchases because first of all I didnt call them to inform my international trip and its Been A doormat account. Since I am away for months I never get the chance to see all my mails not until when I came back to the US last XX/XX/XXXX. I received Wells Fargo declining my request for reversal, so I appeal again like 5x already but still they are telling me its a valid transactions Authorized transaction. I requested a copy of their investigation, the transaction slip shows a different signature, obviously not my signature! I even reach out via email to the store manager where the fraud purchase was made, they even said that they are practicing NO TOUCH policy on all credit card transactions in that store. I think their mistake is not checking the i.d of the cardholder. 
I am not responsible on this purchase. They should investigate thoroughly and charge that company who made mistake. I will try to get a police report when I fly back to the XXXX. 
This is stressing me out and Its affecting my credit score."
823,On XXXX 2020 my bill did not go through when it was on auto-bill. I reached out to the company and they said that they saw the payment try to come out of the bank but it was rejected. They never notified me of the rejection and gave me this late payment. I now can not get a mortgage because of this mark on my credit and the company will not help me with this unfair situation.
824,"The end of XX/XX/XXXXI called Wells Fargo Customer service to inquire about how to payoff my cash advances that were made on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The rep told me as long as I paid by my due date which is on the 9th of the month the total cash amount plus my min pay that it would be paid off. Obviously this did not happen. I paid a total of {$3100.00} and it posted on my account on XX/XX/XXXX.

I received my statement around the XX/XX/XXXX and I realized that I had an interest charge for cash advances of {$25.00} on my account then i saw that my available cash for an advance was not showing all was available. It was showing i still owed approx {$1100.00} towards my cash advance. I called Wells Fargo on the XX/XX/XXXX and was told that they would request for {$3000.00} to be refunded back to my checking account they will keep. {$15.00} for the minimum payment so I would n't be charged a late fee. That request was denied with no reason why. I called back XX/XX/XXXX and a supervisor resubmitted again to get the refund and put in for the cash advance interest charge to be removed. I check my account 2 days later and the refund for the interest was put back but still no refund of {$3000.00}. The whole reason for the refund is so I can pay the {$3000.00} and for all of it to go towards the cash advance. Still no resolution on if and when I will get my money back. Then today XX/XX/XXXX I was informed that no matter what that according to the terms and conditions that any extra money over my minimum payment first was applied to the outstanding balance which was purchase at a 12 % interest which was {$1000.00} approx and after that balance was paid the rest went towards the cash advance. I do  not see how this is leg at based on the credit card act of 2009."
825,"I had charges I did not make from a place I have no idea who or what they are in the amounts of XXXX and XXXX. As soon as I noticed the charges I called and reported the charges as fraud. The charges were made on XX/XX/XXXX. I was sent a new card. The charges disappeared. Then I noticed several weeks later that the charges were back, so I reported them again as fraud. The charges again disappeared. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating the the charges were authorized and that because I was in possession of the card at the time the charges were made that they were not fraud. That was the only reason given. Obviously, it is XXXX not XXXX and there are ways for your card to be compromised other than losing it. On XX/XX/XXXX, I again called to dispute the charges and was told that I must resubmit my claim and reopen the file, which I had them do. Now the charges are back on my credit card account and I am having to wait XXXX days for resolution on these charges that are clearly fraud."
829,Had a credit card from a furniture company with Wells Fargo. Paid the card off in XXXX asked to make sure my automatic withdrawal was cancelled was told it would be. Money was taken out of my account in XXXX for the account that had been closed and paid per the agreement. I called them twice. The first call was XXXX XXXX and the guy was totally incompetent. Called again in XXXX and was told that I had to wait 45 days for my money which they took out of my account against my permission. That is fraudulent. I met my obligations and they didnt meet theirs. As of XXXX I still have not received my money which they should pay interest on.
833,"I received an introductory offer. I just bought a new homeand was renovating the heater and AC. XXXX representatives were here offered me credit at at 9 % the Wells Fargo offer was for 0 % no teanfer fees so I called Wells Fargo on my cell phone, the agent took my information but told me that i only qualify for XXXX XXXX dollars. So i advised her that i did not want the credit card and she asked me if i deined the card which i said yes. I received a bill which i didn't open stating that XXXX was sent to my XXXX card. I noticed an XXXX repayment on XXXX, they adbised me that Wells 3sent the electronic payment so XXXX card resent the payment which Wells Fargo told me to hold on to it. Now i have been trying to get resolution and today i called again a d was ts that Wells Fargo doesn't send out resolution letters, theres3no phone recordings and i am out XXXX, i can't speak to anyone. I need help grom these thieves."
834,"I have been banking with Wells Fargo since XXXX when it was XXXX XXXX. 

My local Wells Fargo branch in XXXX XXXX XXXX MD is where I did the majority of my banking. 

I would go to the branch to do deposits and my account was a primary checking account preferred customer. One of my children is XXXX and would be with me and her attention is very short. 
The sales associates at the front counter were always trying to get me to sit down with one of there sales banking representatives or the manager. I explained many times I was ok with my account at there bank and was not interested in other bank services.This harassment went on regularly. 
We ran into some financial difficulties with my child attending hospital and getting XXXX XXXX outside the home.We defaulted on our junior lein on our home. 

Recently Wells Fargo contacted me about our accounts with them and reviewed the history with me. XX/XX/XXXX there is a credit card denial and went over the reasons. 
I have an active credit card with Wells Fargo for many years. I never applied for this card in XXXX and they said they have no history of me applying .This is identity fraud FULL STOP. 

In XXXX I did apply for a home equity loan with Wells Fargo to pay our delinquent junior lein on our home. The application was denied because of the serious delinquency we had. 
I can understand why they rejected the home equity application but I feel when we were trying to building our credit score back up sales representative runs my credit and tried to open a credit account so he could earn commissions.

My credit score would drop down more when the rep pulled my credit for the credit card. 
I am trying to rebuild and some sales representative drags my score down more. 
I would like to talk to some senior management on this matter. 
Respectfully, XXXX XXXX"
836,"On XX/XX/2022 at XXXX XXXX I made a deposit on my credit card to a teller named XXXX at the Wells Fargo bank in XXXX Nebraska off XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX using my ID that has my married name. My account is under my maiden name. I have always used my ID card there in the past but had been a while but if anything they ask me if the account possibly is under another name because birthdate and addresses dont match any other account and even the manager at bank confirmed that they should look at more than just the name. They had my marriage certificate on file so I was able to use both names ( which they say now they dont ). I didnt really think anything of it til the money went missing. I deposited {$1500.00} in cash {$100.00} bills. 
On Saturday the XXXX, while looking at my account I didnt see the deposit. I pulled out my receipt and it showed the last 4 digits of the account number was different than mine. I called the customer service line and gave all information I had including the receipt information. They told me it would be sent to be investigated and would take 3 business days and I would receive an email to the email on file ( have still yet to receive any emails pertaining to this situation from Wells Fargo ) and then an additional 1-3 billing cycles to have my funds returned to me. I told them that was crazy because it was an error on their part for putting it in someone elses account. 
On Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX, I went into the bank to see if an actual person could help. The bank supervisor found out what account it went into ( same name as my married name but in a different city ). Then she took it to the local bank manager, XXXX XXXX, he told me there is nothing they can do at the bank to fix the issue because it wasnt found within the 3 hour time frame they are allowed to correct the issue. He talked with me to go over what happened then just called it into customer service just like Ihad to report it again, who told him the same thing about having to wait 3 business days and 1-3 billing cycles and he told them to make sure all fees were waived. 
XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX called and said he still hasnt seen anything with my account and has not heard anything. I told him this is ridiculous cause no one has even contacted me with the initial investigation. And everything just keeps getting passed on. I asked him how do I contact someone above him or in charge of investigation to figure out what is going on. No one has any answers no one can give me to someone to take care of it. He said he would submit a complaint but never heard anything back on that complaint. 
On XX/XX/XXXX put in complaint with XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX called Wells Fargo again talked to XXXX, in customer service, who then transferred me to XXXX who said she could fix the issue. XXXX told me it was going to be 3-10 business days to investigate by the end of the phone call with still no one to be able to help she changed the time frame to 30 days. Then transferred me to XXXX in Customer Advocacy. XXXX communicated through messages with 2 other people telling me XXXX was looking into the account. She said she was messaging with people on the back end and I would receive email by the end of the day on where the investigation is at. I never received that email. 
On the same day XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX from the executive office to follow up with the complaint to XXXX she didnt give any answers still just said she was going to try to get it escalated and would contact me back by XXXX XXXX. 
Today is XXXX XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX and I still have yet to get my money credited to my account nor receive another phone call or email regarding my money that went missing."
837,"This particular account situation that is lately filing on my own credit document has a seriously unfavorable relation to my personal ability to obtain a present loan application. I highly recommend you generate verification that Credit Union has been reported completely in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act regulations, it's really a serious problem to misreport. More confirmation of the aforesaid item too. My proper request must over, I was never 30 days/60 days/120 days late in any of my payments and I'm not greatly tuned in to the date opened so I prefer to ask you be investigated as soon as possible and confirmed to be correct. Thanks!"
838,date -- XXXX amount -- - {$3000.00} actions taken -- -Wells Fargo was notified XXXX was notified -- they sent me the fraud alert email FTC notified CFPB notified XXXX froze my accounts
839,Applied for secured Business credit card and getting the run around about the process
842,filed a dispute on XX/XX/18 about a charge I was declining because the service was not done. I informed Wells Fargo I did not want to pay the vendor but they will not refund my money. XXXX corporate sent me to another dealership since XXXX would no longer service my vehicle. The 2nd dealership found the problem and repaired it at no cost since the car is under warranty.
843,"Ive been Wells customer since XX/XX/2013. I do have saving and checking accounts in Wells Fargo. I do also have brokerage account with them as well as the mortgage, and I receive my paycheck in that financial institution as well. 
I applied online to the wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa. When I read the terms and conditions there is nothing mentioning about requirements for certain or specific XXXX status in the US to be eligible. So I went ahead and applied. A few days later they sent a letter noted under # XXXX stating that my application was denied as for this reason : Not a permanent XXXX XXXX.On XX/XX/XXXX I went to the branch I have my accounts and the banker escalated this issue which was registered under # XXXX. Ten days later, XX/XX/XXXX Ive got a call from Wells Fargo advising that as per their internal policy they do not approve credit cards, unless they are secured credit cards, to people that are not XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
My complain relates to the fact that I feel they are discriminating me in the treatment as there are other people with the same legal statues ( valid XXXX XXXX XXXX ) employed legally in the country that were able to get a credit card approved by the same financial institution. Also, if that is a true requirement for all applicants they should state it clearly in the Card Terms and Conditions form which I have with me. In the application they do not check my XXXX status and whether I have the right to stay in the XXXX  long enough to repay the debt."
844,"The American consumer needs help, please expose the new way banks have suppressed credit. We hear so much about Donald Trump there is no space for consumers. There is always something more important to talk about in the media Who is monitoring credit card and credit score reporters So here is my new realization. The lowering of my credit limit has greatly affected my credit scoring, which in turn has affected the way that my other credit companies are viewing me. So, without me doing anything, my credit scores have plummeted. Because of the falling scores and the balance to available credit limits being forced into a balance to limit ratio by the credit card companies own actions, my credit scores are now below the national average. 
I pay ALL my bills on time and for the right amounts. I kept most of my credit card debt ratios BELOW 30 % and have now been reduced to being classified as a high-risk account holder and am being assessed higher interest rates for my remaining balances. I FOLLOWED ALL THE RULES OF MY CONTRACT WITH THE CREDIT CARD COMPANIES AND THEY REWARD MY LOYALTY BY FORCING MY CREDIT SCORES INTO THE GUTTER. 
If I defaulted on my contract with them, my credit scores would be where they are now. SO, TELL ME WHAT IS THE REWARD IN MY PAYING THEM AT ALL NOW THAT MY CREDIT IS AS IF I HAD BEEN A DEADBEAT?? By the time my credit scores return to where I had them, and paid off with the NEW interest rates that they have given me. Wells Fargo could not give me a satisfactory answer to why they lowered my score."
850,"I am a victim of identity theft. Due to the Corona Virus Pandemic, we are all facing which has me sitting still at home and I saw the recent news about the multiple XXXX Data breaches. I decided to look at my credit reports from the 3 major credit bureaus and found that someone had used my Identity. I have no idea how the theft took place. I also have no knowledge of any suspects. I did not receive any money, goods, or services as a result of identity theft. I contacted the Credit Bureau and told me to file an Identity Theft Report which I am doing. I appreciate your effort in getting this matter resolved. Thank you. Please let me know if you need any other information from me to block this information from my credit report. Thank you."
852,"I opened up a credit card with Wells Fargo a couple of months ago with a credit line of XXXX. I did a balance transfer to pay off high interest credit cards which they advertised ) 0 interest for 18 months, so it looked like a good offer. This put my credit card at 55 % utilization plus a couple other charges. I never payed late. I got my statement on XX/XX/2020 with my minimum payment due, and my current credit limit of XXXX. I noticed on XX/XX/2020 they decreased on their website my credit limit so now my usage is at almost XXXX percent. I understand they don't have to notify me of this, but this a new account and I have never seen this happen. I called Wells Fargo and ask them why they said because I opened a new credit card somewhere else ( I opened a XXXX  card because I just bought a house ) and I and my checking account is low- ( I have Checking account with Wells Fargo ) I told them a checking account is not a savings account, and that I have two savings account with another bank do they need proof ) to make a long story short if they pulled my credit report I have several credit cards, and my overall credit usage is under 20 % with 80 % of them with NO balance, I only used so much on this card because of the balance transfer. My credit is over 700- which is considered good standing on credit reports. I feel this not only will dropped my credit score but could jeopardise my existing credit with my other lines of credit. This is just bad practice."
855,"I RECENTLY PAID OFF IN FULL MY CREDIT CARD BALANCE FROM XXXX ( ISSUED BY WELLS FARGO BANK ) AND WHEN I PULLED MY CREDIT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS REPORTING CORRECTLY IT WAS NOT. I ALSO NOTICED THAT THEY HAVE REPORTED THIS ACCOUNT AS BEING LATE ON PAYMENTS FROM XXXX OF XXXX TO XXXX OF XXXX AND THIS IS INCORRECT. MY DEBT WAS BEING MANAGED BY A DEBT MANAGEMENT COMPANY WHICH ALL PAYMENTS WERE MADE THROUGH THEM TO INCLUDE THE FULL PAY OFF AMOUNT JUST THIS MONTH. 

I CALLED XXXX AND THEY ARE NOT HELP, THEY CAN NOT PROVIDE ME WITH VERIFICATION OTHER THAN TELLING ME IN THEIR SYSTEM THAT MY PAYMENT WAS LATE DURING THOSE MONTHS LISTED ABOVE AND THIS IS INCORRECT. ALL PAYMENTS WERE LOGGED BY THE DEBT MANAGEMENT COMPANY. NO LATE PAYMENTS SHOULD BE LISTED ON ANY OF MY CREDIT REPORTS. 

THIS COMPLAINT IS NOT AGAINST THE CREDIT BUREAUS, IT IS AGAINST XXXX FOR VIOLATION OF THE FAIR BILLING ACT AND THE FCRA. IF XXXX DOES NOT REMOVE THE LATE PAYMENTS FROM THE ACCOUNT HISTORY I WILL BE FORCED TO SUE THEM FOR VIOLATION OF THE FEDEERAL LAW WHICH CARRY 'S A {$1000.00} FINE FOR EACH VIOLATON. I WOULD ALSO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT OF ALL ATTORNEY FEES IF IT GOES THAT FAR. 

THEY ALSO ARE STILL REPORTING IN THE COMMENTS SECTION OF THE ACCOUNT "" PAYMENTS BEING HANDLED BY 3RD PARTY DEBT MANAGEMENT COMPANY '' THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE SHOWING UP AS THEY DEBT HAS A XXXX BALANCE AND IS NOT LONGER HANDLED BY THAT COMPANY. 

THE FCRA SAYS ALL INFORMATION BEING REPORTED MUST BE ACCURATE, COMPLETE AND VERIFIABLE AND IN THIS CASE IT IS NOT AND I AM SEEKING AN INVESTIGATION INTO THEIR REPORTING AND ASKING THAT A FINE BE APPLIED TO THEM FOR VIOLATION OF THE LAW. 

THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT WELLS FARGO HAS BEEN GUILTY OF DOING ILLEGAL THINGS AND I WANT FULL RESOLUTION OF THIS ISSUE IMMEDIATELY"
856,"Wells Fargo hasn't provided original documentations when asked by the three credit bureaus ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). I submitted disputes on XX/XX/20, XX/XX/20 and XX/XX/20 with them stating "" You are required under the FCRA to have a copy of the original creditors documentation on file to verify that this information is mine and is correct and to remove the item from my credit file ''. They have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). XXXX has since removed this account from my file but it still remains on my XXXX  and XXXX credit files. Wells Fargo has had a long history of ignoring laws and shady tactics, that sadly affected the lives of millions in this country. In the documents attached below, you will see when I first submitted my 609 letters and XXXX  removing Wells Fargo Card services from my account. Theres a huge inconsistency and inaccuracy on my credit file that takes a toll on my personal growth."
859,"In XXXX I made the mistake of transferring $ XXXX into a credit card account. The next day, XX/XX/XXXX I called to have the funds transferred back where they came from, a non Wells Fargo account. Customer service said they were taking care of it and put in the request. This call was made by me several more times because the money was not leaving the credit card account or appearing back in the checking account it came from. During these calls I was told many different things. Sometimes it was they had put in the request, other times I was given a date that it would be transferred. One particular call I was given a fictitious number to call so I could talk to the person doing the reviewing of the transaction, customer service is apparently trained and allowed to lie. All this time I am having to make calls and arrangements for the account the money was intended to go to. This is all taking an enormous amount of time and ended up costing me several XXXX dollars. On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed the money was no longer in the credit card account. Five days later it was still not back in the checking account. I called to inquire were the money was. I was told Wells Fargo had issued a check and I could expect to receive it in 7 to 14 days."
860,"In XXXX, XXXX I opened a Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX card with a promotional offer to receive {$200.00} on statement credit after spending at least XXXX in the first 3 months. 

Around XXXX XXXX, XXXX I called XXXX CC customer service to ask about the XXXX check I had received in the mail with an offer to do a balance transfer and pay a 3 percent transfer fee to do the balance transfer. After closing my other XXXX XXXX and speaking to several more XXXX customer service reps, XXXX increased my limit on this CC to XXXX and then to XXXX upon my request, since we were buying a car for our teenager. 

The XXXX customer service rep I spoke to about the balance transfer told me that I could make the transfer online myself or she could make it for me on the phone. I then specifically asked this woman ( phone call should be on record ) if t made any difference whether I did the balance transfer online or on the phone, and she stated that it would have the same effect and I would pay the 3 percent transfer fee on the next billing statement. I hung up with the XXXX rep and I then made the {$8000.00} transfer myself from the new XXXX CC to our checking account, since making online transfers is very easy to do. 

The next day around XXXX XXXX, XXXX I saw a {$400.00} cash advance fe on our CC statement online. I immediately called XXXX CC customer service and spoke to a very nice man by the name of XXXX XXXX who helped me. He apologized for the woman 's lack of knowledge about the difference between balance transfers and cash advances, and he credited out CC acct for the 400.00 He then assured me that I would see interest charges for the next couple months but those would also be refunded. 

On XXXX XXXX XXXX an interest charge 0f {$130.00} posted to this CC acct. On XXXX XXXX it still had not been removed so I called XXXX customer service again and asked to speak with a a supervisor. A man named XXXX who had no patient and no kindness about him told me in a very rude manner that I should have known this would have been treated as a cash advance even though the rep called it an online balance transfer. XXXX was very mean and should not be in customer service. He did not even take the time to listen to the mistake that the original customer service rep had made. He told me he could no nothing for me and I could not speak to anyone above him and his manager XXXX XXXX does not talk to customers. 

Our account should be credited the interest charge of {$130.00} and any further planned interest charges should not be charged to our CC acct. 

Although I never received the promised {$200.00} to open this account ( I spent well over the 1,000 req ), they have yet to charge me the 3 % transfer fee so these charges almost cancel each other out. 

It is not fair for big banks to give incorrect information to consumers and then profit off of it. It seems very unethical."

864,Hi there is fraudulent credit card open in my name and I didnt apply for it and this is the fifth time that this credit card keeps reopen and showing up on my credit report under my name and Well Fargo send me letters and said it will take care of the fraudulent charges and that it will be removed off my credit report but new account numbers keep regenerate like 6 times and they keep sending new cards out under my name and fraudulent charges are keep going through on this card and the account was supposed to be closed and this morning on XX/XX/2020 the account was reported to XXXX  and well Fargo fraud department isnt doing anything to fix the problem knowing that previous card numbers were reported as a fraudulent application

866,"I opened a secure credit card in XXXX and I owed one payment the bank wells Fargo froze my account for one day past due {$32.00} payment they said I owed at the end of Februay but I was out of town, so I told them when I pay that fee to close my account out because I saw no reason to withhold my own money from me. They had already opened two additional accounts under my business so I was using the personal account card until they straighten out why I had so many business accounts I did not sign up for. 
The employee told me that I had to come into to bank to make the payment I did and was told to call the credit processing department I again requested that they close the account when I come in and make that payment and they told me I would have to wait until they saw if I had used the card and had payments which needed to clear. I made that payment in XX/XX/XXXX the account was still not closed 30 days later I told them I was not going to pay them anything else and explained that I felt like they were exhorting me by not closing the account and that they were trying to eat up the {$150.00} I had in the account at the time which was suppose to be refunded to me, the employee said that it would take 90 days to close it I said they were not getting another XXXX XXXX from me and I again demanded that they immediately close the account and hung the phone up on her and they still did not close it. I went into the bank and the employee there called them and they claim that they were going to send me the money they took out of my account for the previous three moths when I had requested the closure and they said the reason that they did not close the account was because I did not stay on the phone long enough for the employee to read some type of disclosure. The bank placed that three month that they wanted me to continue to pay on my credit as retaliatory measure or extortion of my money. They eventually sent me the {$150.00} check after over ten months saying they sent it but I never received it I kept calling them and they sent it. More than that I did not know they actually placed those three months that they did not close the account after I thought it was closed on my credit and then lied and said they closed my account on their own when that was not the case. What ever they did destroyed my credit and I have not been able to recover that XXXX points on my credit with any bureau after me having that account for that long and always paying on time, That credit score causing me to not be able to get credit to borrow, refinancing out and continue repairing my nonprofit homes. One of our homes went to foreclosure causing me to pay an extra XXXX to get it back and it affected my personal life as well even to today when I tried to put the explanation it keeps dropping just because I am trying to correct it still. I was not able to purchase a vehicle or my townhome because of that drop in credit. I had that account over 4 years. I decided to sever my relationship with the bank that I was with over fifteen years. This is what my credit bureau said about the account on XXXX, XXXX XXXX and now XXXX  dropped my credit anther 7 pts trying to still get it fixed I need that XXXX points back period.

868,"When checking my Wells Fargo credit card statement online I saw a charge of {$110.00} to XXXX XXXX. I called Wells Fargo to dispute the {$110.00} charge. They provided a receipt which is attached to this complaint. The receipt shows a transaction date of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for a location in Florida. I was not in Florida and I had my credit card in my possession here in Minnesota. Also it shows the purchase was manually entered. I do not believe the receipt provided by Wells Fargo is a XXXX receipt in the first place. I had Wells Fargo cancel my card and issue a new card as this charge was fraudulent. 

I do not have a XXXX account at all. I do have a XXXX phone that gets billed to my father 's account. My father 's account did not receive any {$110.00} credit from Wells Fargo and it should not any way. Wells Fargo told me that they can not reverse the charge since I am affiliated with a XXXX account. Again I do not have a XXXX account. I believe Wells Fargo should be able to tell where they sent the {$110.00} and it was not any account that I charged on. 

I did file a fraud form online with XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX also but no response from them. I believe the receipt that Wells sent me is not a XXXX receipt, I do not have a XXXX account so XXXX really has nothing to trace back. Wells Fargo should know where they sent the {$110.00} but they are not working with me."
874,"I have a Wells Fargo "" Cash on Demand '' credit card with Wells Fargo that i've had for quite some time. I recently paid this account off per the statement i received from Wells Fargo. I was later notified that this account was reported late to the three credit reporting agencies. I called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX to understand how i was reported late after just paying the account off. I was told that there were residual interest charges that weren't reflected on that statement. I informed the customer service representative that i had not received any statement reflecting those amounts ( or i would have paid ). I was told that the statement that would have shown those charges was "" supressed ''. I asked why and the customer service agent could not give me any detail and told me "" you know the post office has been having issues lately ''. On that call, i went ahead and paid the remaining amount to ensure that there are no further issues. However, I was still reported late to all three credit reporting agencies. I do not believe i was properly notified of this issue in time to ensure i did not go 30 days late on this account and i still don't understand why this particular statement would have been "" supressed '' when previous statements were not. I am requesting that Wells Fargo update their reporting with all three credit reporting agencies ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX  ) to remove the reported late payment."
875,"A Wells Fargo credit account was opened in my name without my authorization. The company expressed to me that after an internal investigation it was not going to take any responsibility for the fraudulently opened account because it asserts the account was opened through the mail, and its bankers had nothing to do with opening the account. It further asserts if I did n't open the account then it must have been a third-party identity thief. However, I received the card in the mail, shortly after a Wells Fargo banker had contacted me by phone attempting to sell me the product, which I declined. No fraudulent purchases were ever made on the card. Furthermore, the company has refused to explain how it came to the conclusion the account was opened by mail either by myself or a third-party identity thief, and it has refused to provide any documentation that would serve to bolster or prove its claim, including a copy of the application."
879,"Wells Fargo solicited me for a credit card ( by mail, I believe ). The offer was a {$200.00} reward if I made {$1000.00} in purchases within 3 months. I quickly fulfilled this requirement and called customer service after a reasonable amount of time to inquire when I would receive my {$200.00} bonus. On that call, I was simply told it takes awhile. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called again and was transferred several times to different departments ( I was on the phone for XXXX minutes without resolution of the issue ). The last person I spoke with said the matter would be escalated for research and I would receive a call back on XXXX. That never happened. 
I suffered a great deal of damage to my home during Hurricane Ian and I really could use the {$200.00} now more than ever in order to help meet my emergency expenses. Any assistance you can offer would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance."
880,I was surprised to find out week fargo discontinued their secured credit card and would like to know why it was a good product to help establish credit
881,My card was stolen and I called to report fraud and they took the charges off but put them back on. I never had the card or made those purchases. I did go to the precinct and gave the police the information but they didnt do anything about it. I need these fraudulent charges removed and I contacted the bank many times they arent doing anything.
882,"I paid off my XXXX XXXX Credit Card that was serviced by Wells Fargo Bank. I spoke to the Wells Fargo Representative on X/XX/17 and inquired why there is a finance charge of {$1600.00} on balance of {$2700.00}. He stated that my promotional time has ended and gave me some deceptive information. I informed him that i have not received my statement in mail nor any notification that the account will incur finance charge on the remaining balance. This amount is absurd and unfair. While on the call with XXXX, ID # XXXX, I paid off the entire balance of {$2700.00} and he stated that he will credit my account of the error that has occurred. I requested a XXXX balance letter for my records. <P/>So I logged online today, X/X/2017 after two days the balance was satisfied, I see a balance of the finance charge on my account. <P/>This is deceptive and they are stealing and charging me for nothing. <P/><P/>Please help."
884,I received a letter in the mail from Wells Fargo that stated that they were closing my credit card ending in XXXX. I received this letter on XX/XX/2022. The letter was dated XX/XX/2022. My credit card was at a {$0.00} dollar balance. I had paid it off recently after holding a balance on the card for a bit. This company has made tons of money off of me in interest and decided to close my card due to non-specific reasons on my credit report. I have cards through XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX who did nothing of this sort to me. I am currently looking to apply for a mortgage and this will definitely hurt me in the short term and potentially long term as this was my oldest line of credit.
885,"I applied for ( online ) and was granted a credit card from Wells Fargo for the purpose of transferring XXXX credit cards for a 0 % interest rate for XXXX  months. The transfer fees were 3 %. I was given a {$13000.00} credit limit. I put in online the card numbers and amounts. I owed XXXX {$1100.00}. I must have mistakenly entered {$11000.00} and XXXX returned the payment without posting the transfer because the payment was more than I owed. I then deposited the {$11000.00} check into my bank account. It was held by my bank for one day. I paid Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2022. It posted that day, but since that time, my available credit is only {$17.00}! I've called several times to find out when my credit limit would be adjusted so that I can transfer the remaining accounts. Today, I was advised the credit limit would be updated in 20 days! The payment cleared my bank in three days. The worst part of this is that I was charged a 3 % fee on the rejected transfer balance for {$330.00} and they refuse to reverse it!! I went around and around with the agent. He insists that the fee stands because the transfer was made. I insist that it's a matter of semantics. Yes, Wells Fargo sent the payment. But the transfer of the balance on the account that I wished to charge to my Wells Fargo card was never made. I need to have that fee removed. Please help me."

888,"The company, Wells Fargo, was not applying payments to the correct account. This caused an overpayment of over {$5000.00}. Over {$9000.00} in total mis applied payments. Wells Fargo is now refusing to provide interest on the money, and they want to continue to hold it while they do another 30 day investigation, after the first 14 day investigation found our missing money. Wells Fargo had no problem accepting the money, but when trying to apply it to the proper account they found difficulty. How is this the consumers problem, if they can not apply a payment, return it. 
In attempting to obtain my money and possible interest, I was met with an extremely XXXX individual XXXX, who did no research on the account and started the conversation with assumptions. 
Had XXXX read the file, he could see this had been escalated an investigation was already completed by XXXX in XXXX office. Wells Fargo had retroactively applied the missing payments and refunded interest due, as they should have. That part was handled. Even if it wasn't the same investigation that needed to be completed, XXXX failed to read account notes and treat me with dignity. XXXX attempted to make me feel like a criminal because Wells Fargo failed to apply the payment to the correct account. He went as far as suggesting I am laundering money. Completely unacceptable situation to put a consumer in for his failing to read a file. He was given the opportunity to apologize and read the file and come back to the line, but he did not think that was needed as he wanted to continue on with ignorance, claiming I am escalating the situation. 
Frankly he is the cause of this complaint, I had worked with Wells Fargo for months until this individual just went to far. 

Side note : If a "" new '' 30 day investigation is required to refund my "" over payment '' because I could be laundering money, why would they let me spend it on purchases?"
889,"I was approved for {$9700.00} credit to get cabinets from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I did not get their installation service because we installed the cabinets ourselves but Wells Fargo claims to be investigating and it has been 8 months and have yet to remove the charge from the my balance. 
Wells Fargo also reported my account late to the credit bureau resulting in decrease in 57 points to my score. My account is not late because the balance is still in dispute. 
Wells Fargo also decreased my credit limit almost {$3000.00} after i started the 3rd dispute, for no reason at all also decreasing my credit sore another 26 points. 
Wells Fargo refuses to remove the late charge report even though i was never late and my account shows it."
891,"Wells Fargo credit card reduced my available for purchase balance, from information gathered by credit card services that labeled me a risk. 
I have never been late on payments to wells fargo or any other financial institution, I dont feel I was treated fairly. 
When wells fargo reduced my limit they put me over 75 % usage, taking the surplus cash needed to make my account usage bellow 35 %. 
Being over 35 % in usage is negative to my credit rating, This hurt my small business as far as future growth, its more like a handicap. Credit card services has made a niche for them selves by making the banks believe they are providing protection. 
These people dont know anything about me. I lost my job 2008 during the banking failure, my home was being foreclosed, I pulled my home out and paid all my bills due and raised my credit score to XXXX, I did all of this while raising a family. 
I dont know if they broke any laws, They have certainly proved to be adversarial contrary to all things America should be."
892,"Hello to Wells Fargo, I am XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX born on XX/XX/XXXX, and I do not know XXXX. Most of the time I receive help from my XXXX son XXXX XXXX. I have been their client for many years. 
Approximately around XX/XX/XXXX I logged into my account on Wells Fargo, and then when I did so, there was an offer for a credit card that I was pre-approved for. So, I submitted an application and their response was that they would contact me through the mail in the next week. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Wells Fargo about my application. The letter stated that due to my credit report on XXXX being frozen, they requested I unfreeze it and call them once I did so in order for them to check it. 
The next day on XX/XX/XXXX, I unfroze the credit report and called Wells Fargo with the help of my son XXXX XXXX because I do not know XXXX, and we told them it was unfrozen, thus the representative told us to wait a couple of minutes on the line until she checked my credit report, and then she said everything is good ( and immediately then, XXXX reduced my credit score by XXXX points because of this ) and that they are going to send a response within a week to my home. 
Yesterday, on XX/XX/XXXX, we received a second letter from Wells Fargo, the letter stated the exact same thing as the last, saying that I needed to unfreeze my credit report on XXXX and call them AGAIN. 
I was very surprised by the strange request, and again I used my son XXXX XXXX 's help we called them again on XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX AM ( the call 's length was a total of XXXX minutes ) and we spoke with a representative named XXXX. After she had identified us, she told us to wait in line and that she wanted to speak with her upper management, and her manager said that they want to ask me more questions and if I was okay with answering these questions. I answered positively, and then she said that she had to bring an interpreter on the line. I again answered positively. 
Once the interpreter was on the line, she requested me again to open my credit report on XXXX without asking me any questions. And I told her in a very clear-cut way after XXXX had reduced my credit score by XXXX points, I am not going to open my credit report unless she can guarantee no more points would be taken from my credit score. She insisted that I open it, and I continued saying no, and I told them that I am going to send a complaint to CFPB about them, and I told them at the end of the call that I no longer wanted their card and that I am giving up on it, and that I just want my points back, and we hung up the call.

I am very surprised by the lie in their advertisement for the credit card, saying I was pre-approved and they still requested that I open my credit report, but no problem, I agreed to do it, and I didn't think that so many points would be taken from my credit score because I was pre-approved and their customer for so many years. Because my credit score in their bank is XXXX as of today. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
893,"Hello, I am writing this complaint today because i am extremely upset with wellsfargo 's customer service and actions lately. I've been a valued consumer of wells fargo and a loyal customer of theirs since XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX, i had contacted wellsfargo in regards to multiple fradulent activities that were happening to my credit card account, in which they confirmed i did not have to make payments until i recieved my new credit card. my case was resolved but i still didnt recieve any card, nothing in the mail, or anything to confirm. I didnt pay XXXX, or XXXX because i was out the state. but i come back home in XXXX they closed my account, and they only reason i knew was because i checked my mobile app. i was furious. i never had a late payment EVER. i never had issues with them before so why is it did no one contact me to tell me they were cloing my account. Does 7 years not mean anything. i mean i talked to representatives ive talked to superviors. all they could tell me was "" ma'am '' the accounnt is closed there is nothing we can do. i told them why didnt they notify me and why after my account was scammed would they not try to help me?. now my account is closed and on my credit reports is shows 2 late payments and my score went dramatically down after they closed it. not only am i making payments after finding out they closed but they're charging me an extra $ XXXX of interest each month for my monthly payments. companys like this should work with their clients! its ridiciolous i had to even go to XXXX to make disputes and they told me that wellsfargo does not want to assist them so they had to close my disputes. i worked too hard and put alot of money in wellsfargos pocket for them to close my accounts after their representative misinformed me and never sent me documentations to my home."
895,"I was a victim of fraud. Unfortunately, it was my boyfriend. He emptied my savings of {$10000.00}. He wrote me a few checks for a very small amount to begin to pay me back. Wells Fargo held the checks for a minimum of three days to ensure that they would clear the XXXX XXXX  Account. 
After that he disappeared. What I dont understand is this. I had a credit card with a credit limit of {$4100.00}. I only had used {$2100.00} Of the credit. The following month I had a balance of {$11000.00}. I was livid. I have fought and disputed this with Wells Fargo since XXXX to no avail, the credit bureaus and discussed with lawyers that I can not afford. I finally convinced Wells Fargo to remove part of the bogus charges. They brought the balance down to a little over 7k. I began to pay it down and then let my anger get the best of me. This company is crooked. I refused to pay! {$6700.00} is my current balance. The account has been charged off 19 times. How does that happen? Also, {$6700.00} is well over my limit of {$4100.00}. Remember, - my original balance was {$2100.00}. With my latest dispute they reported a late payment of XX/XX/XXXX and removed the max debt of $ 11k+. How crooked! How is that possible? The last late payment reported was XXXX XXXX and the last charge off date was XXXX XXXX. This is truly damaging my credit score. Please help me if you can! Kindest Regards, XXXX XXXX"
897,"XXXX/XXXX/XXXX We agreed to purchase a wall furnace from Terrys Heating and XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Idaho. They stated we could have a contract for 60 months and the lender would be Wells Fargo Bank. We stated we did not like Wells Fargo, but they stated they were the only bank setup to carry their contracts. We filled out a credit app and was approved for the contract in the amount of {$3200.00} which included a {$1000.00} down payment. The contract states a 9.9 % interest rate with XXXX equal payments {$61.00}. We were sent a credit card from Wells Fargo that XXXX XXXX Projects, Terrys Heating and AC which they stated just ignore. We began payments of {$61.00} in XXXX XXXX and have made XXXX payments. Wells Fargo Financial XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX Texas XXXX accepted the first XXXX payments without a problem. However, in XXXX they began charging an extra fee. A late fee of {$27.00} and interest of {$26.00}. The check was mailed the XXXX of the month and not posted until after the due date of the XXXX. They asked for a payment of {$88.00}. We sent our {$61.00} payment as due by contract. In XXXX we were billed another late fee of {$38.00} and interest of {$26.00} and a payment of {$120.00}. Our check was posted on the XXXX After calling them there was no resolution. They stated they had no control over the posting date or the mail. They refused to remove the fees. It is apparent they have converted the contract into a credit card account which we did not agree to. Our balance right now is {$3100.00} nearly the same amount we began with. These fees were posted fraudulently and not agreed to. It appears they plan on adding fees every month and ignoring our original contract. We are angry that the account is now a credit card account which we did not agree to and at the current rate it will clearly not payoff in 60 months. We went to our bank today and got a personal loan and paid off the balance of {$3100.00}. We have a higher interest rate and a higher payment but atleast we know we are secure in the amount and the timely payoff. We have copies of the contract, the card and the statements Wells Fargo has sent. We will send them to you when requested. We do not want private information posted on this site."

Called the customer service team and they indicated they needed in person verification. I took time off work to go to one of the local branches so they could do the verification. They told me the issue was resolved and I should be able to create my account. Tried creating my account but I was not able to. Waited some more to see if it just need to be refreshed. I tried in several occasions but was not able to. Called on XX/XX/28 to get help, was told a technical support ticket was opened and the issue would be resolved in a few days. Never heard back. When my account is due they sent me an email asking to log in to view important messages. I tried longing in but couldn't. I called their customer service team, spent just about XXXX minutes on the phone with several transfers and holds and the issue was not resolved. I am having a hard time trusting this financial institution with my private information as they cant even resolve their own internal system issues.

I reported the fraud to the police and contact Wells Fargo right away to report the fraud as well. Wells Fargo temporary credited me back for the fraud purchases then reversed the credit saying to me by letter the charges are from a company I do business with. Its XXXX of course I have done business in the past on that same account but this was not me and it was fraud. I did everything I should even filing a police report but Wells Fargo is not helping me.

Wells Fargo uses XXXX  to spit out policy as in the proof of this letter. Let me explain for those educated under the present system. As a result of a recent review of your XXXX we closed your debit and/or ATM card on XX/XX/2023 to prevent further risk to your account.

Is the card holder a criminal who is improperly using and abusing his prevlidges? He must be a criminal as we are giving him XXXX  months in Wells Fargo financial jail.

906,"i am a member of Wells Fargo. My credit card gets charged way too high for "" interest on purchases '' and it doesn't make sense, because I'm never late on paying for it. Even my credit score has been lowered!"
909,"I have continued to have a credit card only relationship with Wells Fargo for the past 10+ years. During this time I have had automatic monthly payments scheduled to pay the full amount due on the first part of the month. 

Recently I opened a bank account with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/20. Additionally, I set up additional bank accounts for third-party bank transfers. Somehow on XX/XX/20 my existing automatic payment with a third party bank for my Wells Fargo credit card was cancelled. Because of this cancellation I incurred a late fee as well as a late interest on my credit card. I paid the balance in full for the previous statement and called to speak to a Wells Fargo credit representative to have the late fee waived and they are looking to potentially reverse any accrued interest I may have received. However, the option to setup monthly payments for my credit card is no longer available from my Credit card account. The only payment frequency that exists now is one time and the rest have disappeared from the website. 

I spoke with the credit card services department as well as online banking to explain to them that this is a serious issue to have removed the automatic monthly payment option now that I have added a new checking account. The only option I have now to automatically pay my credit card each month, outside of sending them a paper form to setup automatic payments again from my third party bank, is is to enroll in their online bill payment program and have my credit card paid using this option. This is unacceptable and appears to be an abuse to force users to not only enroll in their bill pay service, but I believe it was in fact Wells Fargo who cancelled my automatic payment once my checking account was created which caused me to incur a late charge and fees for that month."

913,"Per FACTA and the Furnisher Rule, furnishers have the strict responsibility to supply accurate data. They are also obligated to furnish information in a way that prevents re-aging and duplicate reporting, In my case, case number #, the furnisher did not supply accurate data to my credit report. Wells Fargo failed to see that the information reported to my credit report was actually an account being re-aged. They were student loans and were just sold to a new servicer for the seventh time. As a result of Wells Fargo 's haste, other creditors, I was in good standing with, followed suit. Wells Fargo 's incredible mistake destroyed my credit in an instant. 

So I ask Wells Fargo Bank/Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, who picked up both of my mortgages with different addresses, on the secondary market, to which I paid them both off with no lates why? Including my Wells Fargo Auto Loan with the same defaulted student loan debt I was approved with when I obtained my mortgages ... .again to which I paid off the auto loan that had no lates too, ... Why? Why decrease my credit card limit? When I have proven to Wells Fargo I am a good risk ... that I managed my credit well. To which I did waaaay before Wells Fargo abruptly destroyed my credit profile on false information. I can provide documentation that my other creditors reacted in the same manner as well as closed my account. They may have the same policy but, they didn't react until Wells Fargo took the first move. 

I understand that Wells Fargo Bank can decrease my credit line for any or no reason. But Wells Fargo told me the reason ; and the reason turned out to be false. Again as a result, my credit rating had diminished and other accounts closed. 

Please note that each furnisher is required to implement their written policies and procedures concerning the accuracy and integrity of the information that they furnish to reporting agencies. 
In fact! FACTA Requires furnishers to have such procedures and policies to avoid furnishing inaccurate information ; most importantly avoid furnishing information in a way that prevents re-aging. 

But that didnt happen in my caseor did it? See Wells Fargo wouldn't know because they relied on some other furnishers reporting to be accurate ; and without hesitation Wells Fargo reacted without any investigation on their part of the truth to the reporting. 

Everything I have talked about in this letter is true and factual.

914,"We used XXXX XXXX XXXX service to advertise a B2B service of our company. After getting wrong calls, for example someone calling to order a fast food package, or printing puzzles, etc, I called XXXX to complain on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The representative, which by the way was recorded, said that since I wold have no control over the keywords in XXXX, we should switch to XXXX from XXXX XXXX. I said ok, and that we need help in cancelling the account and help with signing up with their other service. I never heard back from that representative, which I was hoping will be via email or phone call. After a few days, I noticed that we were still being charged and that the amount was increasing without our consent. So I complained to Wells Fargo, and was assured help with this dispute. Then, today I got a call from their dispute department saying that they have received a letter from XXXX that all my claims are untrue and that I have only until Monday to help provide proof. I told the representative that I have the calls recorded that will prove that I complained that I was told I have no control over my XXXX account. But the Wells Fargo rep kept saying we can not use that. If I can not than it is very unfair that I am not being given a chance to prove that I tried resolving the matter with the merchant and the credit card company."
918,"On XX/XX/2018, I had contacted Wells Fargo to schedule a recurring automatic payment in order to cover the minimum payment on my Wells Fargo credit card. I had also submitted a one time payment on the same day.

My payment due date was set to be XX/XX/2018 for {$25.00}. I was never notified that the payment was unsuccessful and now I have a late payment posted on my credit report. I am now in looking to become prequalified for a home and I have been advised that I can not get a mortgage because of this mark on my credit report in this situation, because I have attempted at resolving with Wells Fargo representatives."
919,I had already communicated this issue to the CFPB but it was left unresolved. On XX/XX/2017 Wells Fargo Financial charged me an unexpected {$5.00} interest fee and my balance stands at {$6.00} currently after i had managed to pay it all off. I made them aware i am paying my student tuition at XXXX XXXX College currently at {$11000.00}. They have continued their push to charge me unexpected and exceedingly high interest. I am asking that the cfpb help me resolve this as soon as possible to reach a solution.

I filed a police report and I have a detective on the case. I have messages from the person who took my wallet as well as other evidence to support my case. After getting denied multiple times from Wells Fargo Credit Card Claims, I have gotten in touch with the casino myself and have found out that Wells Fargo Credit Card Claims lied about reaching out to the casino to get video surveillance footage. 

Wells Fargo has been denying my case for the last XXXX  months with one blanket response, "" the casino verified my identity because my driver 's license was presented. '' They have ignored all evidence I have sent them, they have lied about reaching out to the casino themselves, and they haven't reached out to the detective regarding the case. 
I talked to the head of security at XXXX. He said they would never tell a bank to reject a case because of an identity verification. Protocol is to have the person whos card and identity was stolen to file a police report and have the police reach out to the casino. Which I have now done. 

The charges have increased to over {$7000.00} now because of cash advance fees. My credit score has been ruined. This is all because of unfair mistreatment from Wells Fargo Credit Card Claims.

930,"On XX/XX/2019, COMPLAINTANT had applied for one of Wells-Fargo 's credit card products using online and phone calls. It was denied with reason "" Identity can't be verified '' and representative ( s ) recommended visiting local branches nearby to complete this application. However, an application using identical name/address/SSN was granted credit line ( cards delivered ) with a different bank or had identity verified for leasing other merchants ' services without having to visit a branch or run into "" Identity can't be verified '' problem. COMPLAINTANT asks that Wells-Fargo look into how this has occurred, as other applications pertaining to credit reports processed through major credit bureaus usually do not produce such results. It seems like a possible internal error within Wells Fargo. Though COMPLAINTANT recognizes and acknowledges Wells-Fargo 's right to refuse to service to anyone for any reason ( as long as it doesn't pertain to discrimination based on age/religion/gender/nationality ), COMPLAINTANT will retain the assertion to describe Wells-Fargo employees as having bias against the COMPLAINTANT, thus required unnecessary authentication procedures beyond what's already available, something they do not require onto others. Wells-Fargo can feel free to show that other applications were also rejected and had asked those applicants to visit a local branch for something that can be done online ( on the same criteria used against the COMPLAINTANT to have him visit a local branch )."
931,"We paid for a storage unit using a Wells Fargo credit card card for several months. When we vacated the unit and followed the proper procedure for discontinuing the service, we found that we were charged for an extra month. We discussed this with the vendor who claimed to issue us a refund for that extra month we were erroneously charged. After several days, we still did not see the refund, we followed up with Wells Fargo who confirmed that no refund processed and none was in process either. At this point, we filed a dispute with Wells Fargo on the charge. We got a claim number for the dispute on XX/XX/XXXX. 

We received emails from Wells Fargo every 2 weeks saying we are making progress on your dispute. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a voicemail from Wells Fargo asking us to call them back. We did so immediately. Over the course of the conversation with the claims team representatives, we were told that actually, nothing at all had happened with the claim since we filed it on XX/XX/XXXX ( despite the emails from Wells Fargo assuring us otherwise ). The representative said that they needed another 3-5 business days to process a temporary credit on our card. 

So as of the time of this writing, it has been 94 days, past the limit that Wells Fargo has to resolve a dispute."
933,"I live in California. I purchased baseball tickets from a company called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for a game in New York on XX/XX/XXXX for {$140.00} using my Wells Fargo debit card. 
Because of the Covid -19 situation, I quickly changed my mind about attending the game and I planned to resell the tickets. However, to this day, I have not received the tickets or an answer from the company. 
I open a dispute with Wells Fargo and they told me I had to wait until XX/XX/XXXX, the day of the original game, to see if I receive the tickets. 
I received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX from Wells Fargo stating that since the purchased was made from me or an authorized person, the dispute was decided against me. 
I never disputed I made the charge. I disputed I never received the product I paid for."
934,"In this case, I disputed 3 charges with Wells Fargo, which were {$610.00} each. Wells Fargo then provided me with 3 provisional credits for the 3 disputed charges. ( Screenshot attached ) A week later, ( on XX/XX/18 ) Wells Fargo sent me a letter ( attached ) stating that the merchant had refunded one of the {$610.00} charges ( on XX/XX/18 ), and that Wells Fargo will re-charge for the corresponding provisional credit they provided, however, they never did, until XX/XX/18. ( over 100 days later ) I believe the former was not timely, since the bank did not re-charge within a reasonable time-frame in accordance with UCC Chapter 4-215.

The other 2 disputed charges were refunded by the merchant on XX/XX/18. ( Screenshot attached ) On XX/XX/18, Wells fargo subsequently sent me an email / letter ( attached ) stating that the other 2 provisional credits, which were for the remaining 2 charges, have now become permanent. 

Specifically, they said, "" We are pleased to let you know that the temporary credit we posted to your account for {$610.00} on XX/XX/2018 is now permanent. 

Your dispute is now closed. 
A dispute final close letter will be sent through the US postal service. '' However, on XX/XX/18, they re-charged for these 2 provisional credits they placed on XX/XX/18. I believe all 3 re-charged amounts, which Wells Fargo re-charged on XX/XX/18, were not timely, in accordance with UCC Chapter 4-215, and possibly in direct violation of Banking Regulation E and Z, in addition to other compliance regulations Therefore, I believe their right to re-charge should have been forfeited. If so, Wells Fargo should be required to credit back the 3 {$610.00} charges. 

The timeline is as follows : Timeline : XX/XX/18 - Disputed 3 charges for {$610.00} each XX/XX/18 - Wells Fargo sent letter stating, "" We have closed your dispute Dispute Number : XXXX Date Posted : XX/XX/2018 Merchant Name : XXXX *XXXX Amount of Transaction : XXXX Card Number : XXXX Status : Closed - Credit Posted "" We are pleased to let you know the merchant has refunded your account for {$610.00} on or around XX/XX/2018. 

Your dispute is now closed. 

If we temporarily credited your account while we investigated your dispute, well remove our temporary credit by re-charging your account. The merchants credit will remain on your account. 

A dispute final close letter will be sent through the US postal service. '' However, Wells Fargo never recharged for this provisional credit til XX/XX/18. 

XX/XX/18 - The remaining 2 disputed charges were refunded by the merchant ( {$610.00} x 2 ) XX/XX/18 - Received Email / Letter notifying me that the remaining 2 credits are now permaneant. ( Even though the merchant provided refunds for these provisionals on XX/XX/18. ) XX/XX/18 - Wells Fargo re-charged {$610.00}, 3 times."
935,"On XX/XX/2017, Wells Fargo unilaterally and without warning closed my Visa Signature credit card and subsequently terminated XXXX Go Far Rewards (points) associated with my credit card account. WF didn't provide a notice that the account would be closed nor the opportunity to redeem points. If redeemed for cash or statement credit (at 1 cent per point) those points would be worth $XXXX. However, redeemed for airfare at XXXX (my preferred redemption method) those rewards are worth $XXXX. It's not an insignificant sum of money and Wells Fargo essentially prevented me from using it. I reached out to Wells Fargo and escalated my complaint all the way up to Case Management / Executive Office, but they refused to reinstate rewards, let me use them or transfer them to a family account for future use."
936,"I obtained Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX credit card in XXXX XXXX XXXX. The card offered a promotional 0 % interest rate on all balances if paid in full within 18 months.

Before the promotional balance ended, my balance on the card was {$5500.00}. Now my balance has increased to {$9900.00} because of the added interest."

Now they want more money. This is not the agreement initially agreed upon."
940,"I have filed a report with the CFPB before and I am doing it again because I have been a victim of identity theft and Wells Fargo is a nasty bank that claims that they are helping consumers but all they do is commit fraud. 
We received your complaint. Thank you. 
We will review your complaint. Depending on what we find, we will typically : Send your complaint to the company for a response ; or Send your complaint to another state or federal agency, or help you get in touch with your state or local consumer protection office ; or Let you know if we need more information to continue our work. 
YOUR COMPLAINT I'm filing this report because I am a victim of identity theft. I came to the US, to the state California at the end of XXXX of XXXX as an immigrant. On XX/XX/XXXX, my social security which I barely had received was used in the state of Arizona inside of a Wells Fargo XXXX to open a fraudulent account for an identity thief. The identity thief used my social security to open multiple accounts with Wells Fargo. They opened a business checking account, a credit card account. I discovered about this issue in XXXX because I never knew that these accounts existed. Since then I've contacted Wells Fargo and informed them that this is an identity theft case and I am not the holder of these accounts. I have never been to Arizona to open such an account and I did explain this to the Wells Fargo representatives over the phone. They told me they will take care of the issue and resolve it. However, I recently started to check again and Wells Fargo have not done anything. The accounts are still reporting. Therefore, I contacted them and informed them of the issue they keep telling me that I am responsible for the accounts. I informed them that these accounts were opened as a result of identity theft in the state of Arizona because I have never been to Arizona. So when I spoke with the representatives of the executive fraud team, I requested the original application that was used in the state of Arizona when opening these accounts. They had difficulties providing the document but they sent it to me and I will attach it in this report. The documents are Record of Application Information and Credit Card Application and Agreement. There is one thing that I did notice is that my signature was forged but not perfectly. I also informed the Wells Fargo executive fraud team supervisor, however, Wells Fargo does not conduct the proper procedures to remove and purge these accounts. I have never associated with Wells Fargo I informed them with that also. As a matter of fact, I never used a credit card in my entire life. Even now I do not use credit cards. They tried to investigate with me when they saw I my credit report that I had bought vehicles. I told them I buy my vehicle cash and leave XXXX to XXXX percent for payments so I can build a credit. My transactions are cash and nothing more. I only have a checking account with XXXX  XXXX XXXX and that is my only account. Under the Bank Secrecy Act Section 1020.220 of financial crimes enforcement network paragraph ( a ) ( 2 ) ( i ) ( B ) and ( C ) the bank must follow the procedures of verifying the individual before opening any account for a consumer by verifying their name, date of birth, address of residency and check for a valid identification. At XX/XX/XXXX I did not have a valid identification in the State of California yet because I was new to the country and did not know the procedures yet. At that time, I barely had my social security. Wells Fargo opened and became accomplice in an identity theft when they opened the account in Arizona. Plus, Wells Fargo have a history of opening fraudulent accounts under consumer names illegally without their consent and authorization. Wells Fargo have a precedent in gaming practices against them. Whilst I understand that {$1400.00} might not be much however, the account is not mine because I never associated with Wells Fargo. I am not requesting another investigation to be conducted because Wells Fargo is a biased bank the record of application alone can serve as sufficient evidence that I was not the individual that opened the account. Per Wells Fargo 's claim the account was opened in XXXX, AZ at a branch with an individual present. However, I have never been to XXXX, AZ to this day and they can check the public records if I have ever set foot in AZ. To my expertise, this account was either opened by an identity thief that impersonated me or Wells Fargo Credit Card Bankers conducted illegal gaming practices and opened an accounts without my permission by forging signatures and creating falsified checks to protect their investments so their shares are not diluted. I do not want to make the allegations that Wells Fargo bankers committed this fraud specifically. But someone opened this account by using my personal information and forging my signature on the documents. Wells Fargo responded to my previous complaint and claimed that they will give me {$270.00} a monetary relief amount. I am not asking for their money because I don't need their money. What I need is the fraudulent account to be removed from my credit report and for Wells Fargo to remove my personal information and the fraud account from their database because the account is not mine and if Wells Fargo is involved in opening this account fraudulently then a class action should take place against them."
944,On XXXX & XXXX I purchased XXXX concert tickets for my birthday that was to take place on XX/XX/XXXX. As of today we have not received a refund and they have scheduled concerts for days that dont correlate with my schedule. I reached out to Wells Fargo after receiving word that refunds wouldnt be issued and they declined my claim XX/XX/XXXX stating its past the 60 days of notice. I had been reaching out to them since XX/XX/XXXX to see what the resolution would be and I have not received my service or refund!
945,"I had a secured credit card with Wells Fargo from XXXX to XXXX. Only recently did I find out that they were reporting on the 3 credit bureaus as if I currently had an account with them. 

I reached out to Wells Fargo on several occasions about this and each time I am told they have no record of me in their systems. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I wrote a letter and went into the branch to have it faxed. I also wanted to inquire on whether or not the funds from my secured credit card were returned to me. 

It is difficult for anyone to find out due to the fact that they can not find any record of me having an account with them. 

I do not owe Wells Fargo any money and closed the account on my own admission."
946,"XX/XX/XXXX I requested a stop payment do to a Nation Wide pandemic. 
In the amount of {$1.00}, XXXX from XXXX XXXX. 
However Wells Fargo paid and my account was debited in the amount of {$1200.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX a provisional payment was issued to my checking account in the amount {$1200.00}. 
Some time between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX the reversal credit from Wellsfargo was removed. I can not provide you with that information that they maniuplated on my account. 

Due to the global pandemic XXXX XXXX  refunded back to my card ending XXXX the amount of {$1400.00}. ( a deposit from XX/XX/XXXX ). 

Wellsfargo assumed that this was part of the same transaction from the stop payment claim on XX/XX/XXXX and the same provisional payment of {$1200.00}. 

However this is a separate transaction and date XX/XX/XXXX and claim and amount. from XXXX purchase return authorized on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Washington card # ending in XXXX.

I was well within the 60 days notice of reporting the damaged cell phone to XXXX. All documentation was uploaded within 90 days on XXXX 

The physical damage was seen and heard by the diagnostic technician. The technician noted significant damage on the repair estimate. The technician saw that the phone did not function because it is obvious to the eyes and ears. He replaced the LCD and button, because the old parts were physically damaged. The reason for the damage is wear. With three phones in my household with XXXX children, we damage cell phones frequently. XXXX wants to teach consumers not to file claims. Wells Fargo needs to know that XXXX is not paying out for valid claims.

954,I paid off a Wells Fargo retail account back in XX/XX/XXXX. My wife did not realize I paid it off and sent in 2 payments totaling {$1500.00}. ( XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXXpayments ). I have since tried numerous times to get these monies refunded back to me. They originally said they would mail out a refund check ( in XX/XX/XXXX ) ; the first check never arrived. I called Wells ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and they said I would need to fill out a notarized affidavit and send it back in and they could reissue  the check. They explained the process could take an additional 25 days. I requested to speak with a manager since this was putting me into a financial hardship. The manager i spoke with agreed with me and explained I would NOT have to fill out an affidavit and a new check would be reissued. I did receive the affidavit in the mail a week later but no check. I was under the assumption from the manager I should be receiving a check so i waited a bit longer. Finally on XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells again and was told by another associate ( XXXX ) that the matter would be resolved and a check would be re-issued. She told me to wait a week or so and call back to verify that it was sent out. I called today on XX/XX/XXXX and again no check had been mailed out. I now spoke with another manager ( XXXX ) and he says there is no way of getting around the affidavit and they will send me another to fill out. My point is they will not allow me to go into a branch to do any of this and now I feel I am jumping through major hoops to try and get my money back. It has been about 60 days now I have been told numerous things from many reps in their retail division but am yet to receive my {$1500.00} back.
955,"I asked Wells Fargo to add an authorized user to my credit card a few months ago. Without explaining to me this would be creating a new credit card account, they gave me a new credit card for my employee to use. As of yesterday XX/XX/2022, my employee informed me her credit card was no longer working. I called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2022, and I was informed it is because her card has not been paid off. I was under the assumption that she was sharing my credit line and has been paying my own card. Wells Fargo opened a new credit card account under my business name without the proper disclosure."
960,"About one week ago my wife and I went to the local jewelry store in XXXX, IL called XXXX XXXX to see about purchasing an item. We were unsure if we could afford it, and the jeweler asked if we would like to check our credit to see if we could take out a loan with Wells Fargo that would cover the cost of the item. The jeweler said that it would not hurt our credit and that we would not be obligated to use credit after checking it. After giving the jeweler the information, we were told we were eligible for enough of a loan ( {$10000.00} ) to cover the item. We could not decide if we wanted the item at that time and told the jeweler so. We later discussed and decided to not purchase the item. Now, we have received a credit card in the mail of Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX with ( additionally ) the merchant name on the card of XXXX XXXX with a credit limit of {$10000.00}. We did not authorize or want a credit card, and this was opened against our will."
961,"Hello, I initially had XXXX Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX Rewards in my account. I decided to "" cash out '' my points in the form of gift cards. I've attached an email from Wells Fargo that shows that I purchased gift cards for : XXXX for {$250.00}, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}, XXXX # 1 for {$100.00}, XXXX # 2 for {$25.00}, and XXXX XXXX  for {$25.00}. 

On XX/XX/2021 I discovered that I had issues with ALL the gift cards : {$25.00} XXXX XXXX  : eGift card was never delivered or emailed to me {$250.00} XXXX : There were XXXX funds on the gift card {$100.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : There were XXXX funds on the gift card {$100.00} XXXX # 1 : There were XXXX funds on the gift card {$25.00} XXXX # 2 : There were XXXX funds on the gift card. 

I attempted to speak to customer service representatives more than three times on XX/XX/2021 and none were able to solve the issues listed. 

I've also attached the gift card numbers which one can look to see the history that the gift cards were never loaded with the allotted amount. I've also attached a confirmation email from Wells Fargo and also a points statement that shows XXXX Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX Rewards being removed from my account to purchase the gift cards and the confirmation receipt email from Wells Fargo that shows the purchased gift cards. I don't understand why Wells Fargo would treat a customer like this ; deplorable."
963,"Previous complaint filed XX/XX/XXXX and closed due to company response. Wells Fargo sent me a transaction report to verify that funds for a balance transfer were sent to XXXX XXXX back in XX/XX/XXXX. This report was sent to XXXX XXXX as they are stating they have no record of the payment from Wells Fargo. XXXX XXXX now states that the report is not the electronic funds transfer report that they need and it does not state that the transaction was received by XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, their payment team can not find a payment of the amount of the balance transfer, {$5600.00}, on or around the date it was supposedly sent. XXXX XXXX states that since the report from Wells Fargo shows no proof of receipt by XXXX XXXX, it is possible that the transaction did not go through. Wells Fargo will not provide proof that the payment was received by XXXX XXXX. I am still left paying the same balance on both cards. Neither company is providing further options."
966,"Please NOTE : A copy of this complaint is being emailed to Wells Fargos CEO XXXX XXXX XXXX, ( XXXX ),  the executive officers of Wells Fargo, ( XXXX ), including XXXX XXXX, ( XXXX, ) The O.C.C., the VA, and the news. 

*A paralegal is helping me draft this letter/complaint. * I am a XXXX yr old XXXX XXXX & XXXX XXXX recipient, Wells Fargo has been discriminating against me due to my "" healthy '' age and has caused me tremendous stress, financial loss, defamed my character and embarrassed me in front of my neighbors. 
Due to my injuries I was given a medical leave but refused my medical leave and although I suffered from chronic pain, rejoined another unit in XXXX to finish the war. 
Although I qualified for VA benefits I did not apply for them for over 50 yrs because I felt other soldiers needed them more. Only after the  death of my wife a few yrs. back did I finally apply to honor her XXXX wishes. 

See the wdiv story for yourself : XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX   XXXX said he didn't previously ask for benefits because so many soldiers from XXXX XXXX XXXX needed what money was available more than he did. But now that his wife has died and his pain has increased, XXXX said he needs help. 
XXXX is a happy-go-lucky man who volunteers at a senior center to keep the elderly entertained. He's suddenly in a situation that makes him very sad. 
"" As she was dying, she said, 'Make sure you go on and apply, ' '' XXXX said. "" I promised her I would. '' He promised his wife that he would apply for military health benefits that he said he deserves due to an injury he sustained during his service. '' HISTORY : Since it is more difficult for me to drive and carry heavy items, a family member suggested I do most of my shopping online and have my items delivered to me. 
So, I joined XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, i did not know how convenient and fast online shopping was. 
But then all these roadblocks began, which I can not understand : On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I applied for a Wells Fargo Credit card Although my credit score with all credit bureaus is over 800, I did not get instant approval. Thought that was strange! 
Wells Fargo claimed they needed to verify my information. I sent them a copy of my drivers license & recent utility bills. I have lived at the same address for over 50 yrs. It is the only address on my credit reports. I have had only 2 phone numbers and 2 email addresses over the last 15 yrs. This is the information I provided on my application so I felt it was very strange that Wells Fargo claimed a need to verify my information. Could it be due to age, that Wells fargo is treating me differently. If i was 40 yrs old would Wells Fargo be questioning my application? 
What I can tell you is that my nephew applied for the same Wells Fargo credit card. His credit score  was only XXXX and was approved instantly with over a {$11000.00} line of credit. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/XXXX confirming I was approved and showing my credit score they pulled was XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received another letter from Wells Fargo with my new Credit card and a credit limit of {$10000.00}. Recall my nephew received a limit over {$11000.00}. 
I activated the card from my phone which Wells Fargo has on file. 
Made my 1st transaction on XX/XX/XXXX and 8 more up to XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received my pin number from Wells Fargo through the mail. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I used my card at the ATM to withdrawal {$480.00} Sometime after that it seems Wells Fargo believed someone else used my card. Apparently they are ignoring the previous facts that I have received and acknowledged all the letters they have sent me, including the pin number, All the information I have used is consistent with my profile and the credit bureaus. Nothing else has changed or out of the ordinary. Therefore it is clear using the PIN number Wells Fargo sent to me triggered the suspicion. Seriously? A family member researched complaints about Wells Fargo and it seems there are numerous similar complaints from consumers. 
When I contacted Wells Fargo through their SECURE MESSAGING platform, I confirmed all the transactions. However, one of Wells Fargos fraud geniss responded that I must go to a Bank with my ID, ask a bank rep to call them and sit there for who knows how long. Did this genis miss the fact I am XXXX yr old? And again, Why am I being treated this way? 
Attached all the messages. 
My attorney thinks we should play their games and since Wells Fargo is questioning the use of this credit card they can not report it to the credit bureaus. He also suggested I follow Wells Fargos lead and file a dispute questioning the charges. Which is exactly what I will do. We will play their games"
968,"Ive applied for a personal line of credit from Wells Fargo, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. 
With the intent to pay off my credit card debt. 

My plan is to pay off all my cards, close the accounts and pay off the remaining balance of my personal lines of credit. I 've struggled to pay off all of my cards because interests rates are going up. I 've transfered a balance from one credit card to another credit card but dinner than later the interest rates start to give up again and I can never accomplish my goal."
969,"Good afternoon Sir or Ma'am, I am filing a complaint against Wells Fargo credit card for failing to resolve a dispute in my favor, as evidence of a company name, XXXX that defrauded me for {$3800.00} on XX/XX/XXXX after they claim that the Sales Order # XXXX was shipped out to me. At first my credit card authorization did not go through because they were persisting on sending me the order. Somehow they were able to later on charge my credit card and event sent me out the order. It was a phone order and the items they shipped to my house were never what I ordered. I called them and asked them to pickup the order sent to my house and they instructed me they would have charged me an additional {$400.00} for the return. I agreed to the return charge, but they never followed up with picking up the order and XXXX  decided to instead sent me additional parts for the messed up order. I kept on writing XXXX regarding a refund for the {$3800.00} and the company 's leadership would always denied it. I also found out the product electronic components were also not working and the product also pose a safety hazard when you seat on it which causes the person to be thrown off the chair when the person tries to turn or even get off the chair. I informed XXXX about the safety with the chair and I was informed that they can't so anything about it and I'm stuck with the chair. 
I contacted Wells Fargo and filed a dispute in order to recoup my money and the dispute department was never able to get the money back. Below you will see the case number including the people who communicated with me and they were very rude and unprofessional.

971,"I engaged an auto mechanic XX/XX/XXXX I had known for approximately twenty-five years to rebuild the engine in my XXXX XXXX. The mechanic sent the engine to a machine shop and after a year, the car came back with parts left out of the engine. The mechanic reluctantly installed the parts, and informed me he was going out of business. He returned the car to me at the end of XXXX when he was closing his doors. The car overheats and will not run for more than about 15 miles on the freeway without losing all coolant, with the overflow bottle blowing out and steam everywhere. There is also an engine knock and low oil pressure. When I complained to the mechanic in an email ( attached ), he referred me to the machine shop ( attached ), with whom I had no contract. The machine shop blamed the problems on the mechanic ( attached ). As three of the four sums I paid to the mechanic were through my Wells Fargo Visa debit card ( {$7000.00} XX/XX/XXXX, {$5900.00} XX/XX/XXXX and {$870.00} XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated a merchant dispute. A provisional credit was initially given, but taken back in XXXX. I received a letter from Wells Fargo saying the matter was closed and the dispute denied. Despite that the Wells Fargo documentation correctly describes the dispute as 13.3 Defective/not as described ( XXXX pgs. 7-9 attached ), page two of the XX/XX/XXXX letter I received from XXXX XXXX at Wells Fargo ( attached ) describes the situation more as a 10.3 ( i.e. no unauthorized transaction ). I never claimed someone else used my card. Rather I complained the merchant did not perform the work adequately. Moreover, the merchant did not provide documentation proving my car runs properly, In fact, his later of XX/XX/XXXX admits there were problems. The merchant also admits he was "" liquidating his business '' ( which is why I could not go back to him for correction of the problems ). When I asked him in an email ( attached ) for relief he referred me to the machine shop, a third party with whom I have no contract and who refuses to take any responsibility. I paid the mechanic, not the machine shop, who the mechanic selected. 

Visa and Wells Fargo seem to have sided with the merchant when no compelling evidence and no third party documentation such as a second opinion letter have been provided by the merchant. I provided a second opinion letter ( attached ) at the direction of Wells Fargo, and this seems to have been ignored. Also, it seems Wells Fargo and perhaps Visa ( no access to Visa is provided by the bank ) changed the dispute from defective merchandise to fraud based on page 2 of the XX/XX/XXXX letter from Wells Fargo "" Based on additional documents from the merchant, it was determined the charges were made by the customer or an authorized person. '' It seems rigged by the bank, in that my complaint was for a defective repair, which I have proven and is acknowledged by the mechanic in his own letter ( attached ), not a claim that a transaction was made by someone else."
973,Due to the hardship of covid 19. I decided to take on the covid relief program from XXXX XXXX XXXX. Not knowing that Wells Fargo was going to continue to report late fees and 30 days late on to my credit report.
976,"XX/XX/XXXX XXXX paid {$4700.00} to my Wells Fargo account that made a credit balance of {$390.00} In XXXX I called and requested the credit balance be refunded to my account, not to the last account that made the payment. I was very specific. 
When I had not received the payment I checked online and saw I now had a balance of {$390.00} I called and was advised that Wells Fargo sent XXXX payments of {$390.00} to XXXX I contacted XXXX XXXX who monitored the account for several weeks and advised they did not see any payment from Wells Fargo XXXX 
I contacted Wells Fargo again, who advised they would sent a check to me for the {$390.00} which they did. 
After several weeks I checked my balance, not only was there still a balance of {$390.00}, there was a late payment charge. 
I called and was advised they could see that the checks they sent were rejected and that this should be cleared up. 
Last week I received a letter in the mail advising I was behind in my payments. 
I filed a complaint through Wells Fargo. 
Last night I was advised I needed to make the payments. 
I was also advised Wells Fargo is not able to trace or cancel the checks they sent to XXXXXXXX XXXX and I needed a letter from XXXXXXXX XXXX stating they did not receive the funds. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has now advised they need copies of the checks they did not receive. 
My credit is now in peril as Wells Fargo is showing I am over 2 payments behind on a bill I do not owe. 
I do not understand how 1 person from Wells Fargo can see the checks were rejected, the person handling my complaint can not. 
The person who is handling the complaint advised she listened to all of the recorded calls, she would have heard me being told the checks were rejected. 
This needs to be cleared up, and the account closed. 
This was Wells Fargo 's error, yet my credit is in jeopardy."
978,"For three months now I have had to call XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX because they had a late fee on my account that wasn't accurate. After speaking with them it was determined that because I was paying on the XX/XX/XXXX of the month, it was too early and the payment wasn't being applied to the bill, I worked out with the company that they would apply the payment that was early, that the late fee would be removed and the billing cycle was to be adjusted to allow a payment on the first. Well a month went by and i got another bill, same problem, nothing was done to fix the problem. So i called again and spoke to a supervisor, they ensured and promised me that the problem would be resolved, that the late fee would be removed and the due to the way that everything rolled that I did not have to make a payment in febuary because I was ahead due to the early payment, I followed their instructions, here we are again, another bill with a missed payment because they gave me bad information, failed to follow through on their promises and failed to accurately resolve the issue in the beginning, on the second occasion, on the third occasion, and now I am not dealing with them any more, I need this company reprimanded for this."
979,"My credit card was abruptly closed without notice. There is a large credit balance on the account. I would like the company to refund the credit balance ; either by sending me a check, or by simply reversing the bill pay payments coming from my external bank account."
980,"On XX/XX/XXXX, someone logged into my XXXX account and ordered {$660.00} worth of items to my address ( perhaps to test out if the card will work? Not sure why that happened ). XXXX password manager tells me there was a data breach during the summer of 2020, and I was email bombed for weeks after the incident. Not sure why they were able to order since they don't have my 3 digit security number ( the card was merely saved to my account for speedy checkout ). I would think this is ultimately XXXX 's fault for allowing that. Is it illegal that they do not ask for the 3 digit code? I called XXXX to tell them about this order. I tried cancelling, but it was already being processed ( which is crazy because it had just happened. I applaud their speediness ). They said they placed a flag to the carrier to not deliver, and I never ended up receiving the items that I was not able to cancel. I also called Wells Fargo to submit a fraud claim and to cancel that credit card. The fraud claim came back denied. I repealed the claim and submitted another one, and that was denied. They said I need to contact XXXX. I did. XXXX said I need to contact Wells Fargo. I've called multiple times, and neither say they can do anything about it even though they know XXXX did not deliver the items to me. Very absurd."

I submitted a dispute XX/XX/XXXX to have it removed from my credit report because they cant find it to prove it was mine and accept payment. The dispute was in favor of Wells Fargo, and it is still on my credit report despite being unable to locate the dent and let me pay it off."

I lived in my vehicle for about 7 days trying to keep warm as I had no power for a week and no running water for 3 weeks - I did not have food for 3 days as I was trapped in my apartment. I contacted Wells Fargo and notified them that I would not be making the payment and even updated my mailing address. Wells Fargo Bank representative verified the address change and stated that they understood the issues I was having going into the bank and that I could not make the payment. Wells Fargo Bank representative contacted me on XX/XX/XXXX with a Identity Theft case number XXXX that pertains to a Wells Fargo Employee XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who closed this same account XXXX of XXXX in less than 30 days due to a bank error and our autopay since XXXX and we have had this account since XXXX.

Wells Fargo Bank shut down my credit card on XX/XX/XXXX while we were still under the extended State of Emergency/Disaster order in the State of Texas. I also received my new credit card for this account in XXXX Texas location and it was opened by someone within wells Fargo Bank and there was a white label with my XXXX Texas address placed by hand over my XXXX  residence and then reglued in the same envelope ( this now exposed my new credit card ) and mailed it to my XXXX Texas address.

I have made payments every month, exceeding the min payment amount wanting to pay it off as soon as possible. On statement XX/XX/XXXX I noticed a {$25.00} late fee. It is my fault I did not call at that time. On my statement for XX/XX/XXXX I have a {$38.00} late fee plus interest. I called Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX and was told because my payment for XXXX was received before the statement print date, it was applied as a second payment for XXXX. This made my payment made in XXXX and XXXX late! My payment was received on XX/XX/XXXX and the statement printed on XX/XX/XXXX. Furthermore, during the billing cycle of XXXX it posted a payment XX/XX/XXXX which negates the theory of payments received during billing cycles Printed on my monthly statement : Reminder : Your credit card account may not be paid ahead to avoid making payments in future billing periods. You may pay more than the Minimum Payment Due at any time. However, to avoid late fees and delinquency we must receive at least the Minimum Payment Due ( as reflected on each monthly statement ) on or before the Payment Due Date each billing period until your balance is zero. 
This mentions *NOTHING* about receiving payments before the statement prints not counting as your monthly payment. I view this as a deceptive practice to gain income from late fees. 

When I called I was told nothing could be done. I asked for the late fees and interest to be waived and my payments corrected, as I made my payments on time. I get paid on the XXXX & XXXX. I had been making my payments with XXXX check and as of XXXX with XXXX. I asked for manager, and was again told nothing could be done even though he agreed I had not missed a payment.

1009,"On XX/XX//17, I applied online and was approved for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This card comes with a 20,000 point promotional offer after spending {$1000.00} in 3 months. 

The card received was a Wells Fargo Platinum Rewards which is a different card that I applied for,"
1011,I was reviewing credit card statements and noticed that a XXXX   charge of {$19.00} has been charged every month starting on XX/XX/18 to current. This is a service that I never signed up for!
1012,"on yearXX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX I was a client of Wells Fargo I had a debit card that I overdrawn and never paid back I also never closed the account. OnXX/XX/XXXXwhen I had a stable job I decided to start applying for credit cards to build up my credit, I downloaded an app called XXXX XXXX and I got a big surprise I had horrible credit,a big debt of XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX I called and they told me it was an account from Wells Fargo and I agreed to pay XXXX a month to pay off the balance because I thought this was the debt from my overdrawn account, I paid XXXX dollars a month for about 6 months until I went to Wells Fargo to see if I could get a second opportunity checking account since I was ""supposedly"" paying off the debt on my old checking account, and then another big surprise for me, the personal banker told me I owed XXXX from my checking account and that no payments where made to my account I got out of the bank and called XXXX and they told me the debt was about a credit card. I told them that I wanted to stop making payments to the balance since I never requested, authorized or open the account, I made a fraudulent activity the XXXX  and I really want this out of my credit because it is really affecting me."
1015,"In XX/XX/XXXX I did a balance transfer with Wells Fargo and Zero Interest. 
Later had to use my credit card for purchases but I made a payment later to cover those purchases and be left only with my balance transfer at zero interest. 
Not using my credit now for several months I noticed I am being charged interest on purchases. When I reached out to wells fargo my call was escalated to a XXXX XXXX caseXXXX. 
He told me payments were allocated to my zero interest balance instead of covering my interest. I told him it was misleading decieving and benefiting wells fargo to allocate my payments to a zero interest and leaving a balance on purchases so they could continue to charge me interest! 
On wells Fargos recorded line he said an accountant would allocate the payments towards my purchases therefore I wouldnt continue to be charged interest. And could start paying down my zero interest balance. 
Now 3 weeks later no one wants to acknowledge what happened, what was promised even though they went back to recordings and heard it all."
1016,"I called the credit card company on XX/XX/2020, and ask if I didn't want any charges to go through on the card what can I do, I was told that they could pause the card, so I agreed to that service they had suggested. On XX/XX/2020 the credit card let a charge go through in the amount of {$1000.00}. When I called to find out why the charge went through, I was told that reoccurring charges would go through, I told the credit card company that was not explained to me when I called to stop charges on that card and I was not properly informed so I could have taken different actions at that time, told me I can dispute the charges in which I did, on XX/XX/2020 I received a notice that they declined my dispute dated XX/XX/2020"

This card has been paid off and should be reporting the bureaus as such. Straight violation of the FCRA.
1025,Wells fargo stole around {$8000.00} out of my account. My husband had a credit card with them and they illegally added the credit defense platinum on to it without authorization. After wells fargo lost their class action lawsuit they refunded us a check for {$3500.00}. This does not come close to what we are owed. We could not finance a house and had higher interest on vehicles because of lowered credit score. We would like our money back and I can not get any on the phone that can explain why we received that number back or why they were able to go into our account and take money that was not theirs.

1030,"On XX/XX/2022, went to a resort for an excursion : jet skiing. After our excursion, I bought beverages : {$66.00}. Yes, had card in my possession that day, Thursday XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX 

On Friday XX/XX/2022, there were three ( 3 ) unauthorized charges of {$700.00} : total of XXXX. Wells Fargos claims the charges were made via chip ; meaning it was in my physically possession and authorized the charges. However, I made XXXX charges that day, Friday XX/XX/2022. I did NOT physically have the card in my possession. Going forward I did have the card. I believe my card information was stole the day of the beverage purchase or in my hotel the day the fraudulent charge was made. The card was at my hotel with all hotel personnel having access to my hotel room. I did NOT use and/or have my card in my possession XXXX, XX/XX/2022. I was out and about exploring."
1033,"A formal complaint has already been filed with Wells Fargo. Case # XXXX I have a XXXX card and a mortgage with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo 's reward program for this card is called the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Through the program the card holder earns a one percent ( 1 % ) Cash Reward for every one dollar ( {$1.00} ) in net purchases ( purchases minus returns/credits ) made on this credit card account rounded to the nearest one cent ( {$.00} ). There is no limit to the cash rewards that can be earned through the program. 

I decided earlier in the spring/summer of XX/XX/XXXX to start using my Wells Fargo credit card for all my monthly expenses so that I can earn the 1 % on purchases. Once my cash reward reached {$25.00} Wells Fargo then applies {$25.00} to the principal of my mortgage, which is also through Wells Fargo. Everything had been working well until the last few months my payments were not being applied in a timely manor. I called the customer service department and they explained it sometimes take XXXX business days for the payment to be reflected in my available credit even through it is already reflected in my out standing balance. Since I was noticing a delay in the payment processing of the electronic payment sent by my credit union I then started to make my payment through the Wells Fargo website. This payment is issued from the same account with my credit union. 
My most recent issue leads me to believe that Wells Fargo was purposefully delaying posting my payments to my account so that I would not have the credit to continue to make purchases and earn the 1 %, which eventually apply to the principal of my Wells Fargo mortgage. 

Here are the details : Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX - {$470.00} Electronic Payment issued through credit union online bill payment system Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX - {$470.00} payment subtracted from my checking account balance ; payment not reflected in Wells Fargo available credit balance. 

Friday, XX/XX/XXXX - payment still not reflected in Wells Fargo available credit balance.
Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX - payment of {$230.00} made through Wells Fargo website.
Monday, XX/XX/XXXX - payment of {$470.00} and {$230.00} still not reflected in Wells Fargo available credit balance.
Monday, XX/XX/XXXX - automatic credit card payment of {$320.00} for auto insurance declined due to insufficient available credit. 

First Customer Service Rep explanation - it takes 3-4 business days for payment to fully process. Note : Monday, XX/XX/XXXX is the 4th business day. 

Requested to escalate issue and spoke with manager, XXXX - Same response ; it takes 3-4 business days for payment to fully process. Note : Monday, XX/XX/XXXX is the 4th business day. 

Requested again to escalate the issue and file a formal complaint - spoke with XXXX. She explained that a payment hold had been placed on all payments on my credit card account. 
Wells Fargo 's reason for payment holds : too many payments made on the account before the close of the billing period and payments made from multiple sources. Payment holds can take up to 10 day to apply to the available credit balance. 

XXXX verified : My account was in good standing. 
I had this card for XXXX years All payments were made on time and never past due and I never had a payment returned. 

Additional Information : All payments made on this credit card, as wells as my Wells Fargo Mortgage, have been issued from the same checking account I have had for over XXXX years. 
Payments were made by electronic payment through online bill pay through my credit union OR electronically through Wells Fargo website to issue from my same credit union account. 

Wells Fargo 's practice of delaying the posting of my payments has made it so that I can not use my card to make purchases and therefor reducing the amount that I am able to earn as part of the XXXX XXXX XXXX Program. 

Wells Fargo has removed the payment holds from my account, but warned if I continue to make more than XXXX payments in a billing cycle before the cycle closes, another payment hold could be placed on my account. The rep offered to set up the account on automatic payment to avoid this occurring in the future. I asked how that would help, if only one payment is made that limits how much I am able to charge in a month. 

I was also warned, if I continue to use multiple payment options that could also trigger a payment hold on the account. However the representative informed me they do offer 7 ways to pay the payment. 

After an hour and an half on the phone, at this time the payment hold has been lifted and the representative informed me for my troubles they will credit back the interest payment of {$22.00} that I made back in XX/XX/XXXX. This is because I have not recently incurred any interest because I have been paying as I charge in order to avoid interest and keep credit available to charge and earn 1 % XXXX XXXX XXXX."

I did not document all the phone calls but only once, which was my last call.

XXXX transferred me to XXXX employee ID XXXX, he could not help as he was not able to pull the account information from his side. He transferred me to XXXX XXXX Employee ID XXXX and asked me to call on number XXXX because he was having trouble opening my account information. I called on that number around XXXX XXXX customer care employee name XXXX XXXX, refused to give me her employee ID and transferred me to her supervisor.

1038,"On XX/XX/XXXX I used one of my credit cards an XXXX XXXX card issued by XXXX 's XXXX XXXX and administered by Wells Fargo Bank -- - to pay for a mission outreach trip scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. I authorized a charge for {$700.00} as a deposit for the trip. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, I became ill and was unable to travel on the trip at the recommendation of my doctor. I immediately asked the mission outreach organization to refund my deposit. I asked them repeatedly over several months for a refund with no success. Beginning in XX/XX/XXXX, I asked XXXX 's to give me back my {$700.00} via its telephone dispute customer service representatives. I called them repeatedly beginning in XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. I received no response from XXXX 's and the {$700.00} charge remained on my credit card statement. I continued to contact XXXX 's about the {$700.00} charge that appeared on my account. This was the only transaction on my card. To this day, the only thing I ever charged on this credit card was the {$700.00} for the mission trip. In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX 's placed the {$700.00} charge in dispute and told me I did n't have to pay it. InXX/XX/XXXX, I contacted my bank - XXXX -- and told them about the problems I 'd been having with getting my refund from XXXX 's. XXXX XXXX investigated and helped me with my dispute by giving me a {$700.00} credit in my bank account. At this point, I was made whole and gave up trying to contact XXXX 's. In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX 's removed the dispute status from the {$700.00} charge and said that I have to pay it. In XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a written request with XXXX 's to remove the {$700.00} deposit for the mission trip from my credit card. In the letter, I told XXXX 's that XXXX XXXX had refunded the {$700.00} I paid on XXXX 's credit card and returned this money to my bank account. I wanted XXXX 's to remove the {$700.00} charge from my account or get their money from the mission trip organization. Prior to sending this letter, I had been told by a XXXX 's telephone customer service representative that I was responsible for getting the money from the mission trip organization and sending it to XXXX 's. I refused to do this. I told them I would not do it via telephone and in my XX/XX/XXXX letter. I received no substantive response from XXXX 's to my letter. In XX/XX/XXXX, my credit card monitoring service began to show that XXXX 's had submitted negative information about my account to the credit reporting agencies. I received notices that XXXX 's claimed I failed to pay my account ; XXXX 's also noted that my account was in dispute. In XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX 's stating my inquiry was being reviewed. However, beginning in XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX 's reported that my account was 30 days past due. This reports of late payments continued until XX/XX/XXXX. I received a XX/XX/XXXX letter from XXXX/Wells Fargo Bank giving me a notice of intent to accelerate and demand for immediate payment of my entire account balance, which they claimed was past due in the amount of {$300.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX my account with XXXX 's was closed by XXXX 's ; the alleged account balance was {$1000.00}. Subsequently, I was denied a store credit card by a small clothing store in XX/XX/XXXX. This was very disturbing to me. I have always been very diligent with my bills and paid what I owed. I believe XXXX 's treatment of this matter has unfairly harmed my credit history. I want all negative information about this account removed from all 3 credit reports and I want XXXX 's to update my credit file to show that this account was closed in good standing. And I want another XXXX 's card to be issued to me. I am a long-standing customer and I do n't deserve this treatment."
1039,"Wells Fargo closed my credit card account which Ive been a member since XXXX. This happened in XX/XX/XXXX due to the fact that my ex wife filed XXXX. I was not aware or did not remember her being on this account as we were married for 34 years I was never notified by the credit card company that they were going to close the account until we went to use the card for a purchase for a business.they damaged my credit score by closing this account. I have tried to contact the company Multiple times XXXX. I was given a XXXX XXXX and a XXXX XXXX names but neither one of these people will return my call and speak with us. I am so aggravated and its not that I need that credit card but the damage to my credit standing from them closing this account I never filed bankruptcy I was never late I always paid my bill, always on time. If not ahead in for this company to just ignore us like we dont exist, has fired me up, especially the damaging of my credit is unacceptable. I want to hear from these people because they need to rectify their mistake. And compensate me for the damages to my credit Thank you."
1041,"I had opened a retail credit card to pay for an engagement ring on XXXX XXXX  XXXX. I doing so, I put money down and was under the impression that there was no interest within the first 12 months, as long as I paid it off. They stayed true with that. What I thought was sly and misleading was the fact that after those 12 months, they didn't charge the regular interest rate on the remaining balance. No, instead, they charged the regular interest rate on what the FULL AMOUNT the ring cost me. I was {$1000.00} shy come the day of the interest charge ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I got married 2 days after that charge ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I didn't notice the charge until I got home on XX/XX/XXXX, which is when I was going to make the final payment, or so I thought. I expected some interest, because I saw the notification that interest would be charged, but I did not realize it would be based off full amount of the item. If I had known that, I would have scraped every dollar possible to avoid that from happening ( on top of wedding payments ). With that said, I paid {$1000.00}, and called to speak with Wells Fargo. After talking to FOUR different people, hung up on ... TWICE, and on hold for a total of 45-60 minutes, I finally was able to speak to the correct person about the issue. I explained the situation and told him I didn't expect to take away all the interest, just not the amount that would have been charged to the remaining {$1000.00}. All he could say is "" I can't do that ''. He was no help. So I tweeted about it. They responded and asked me to DM, I explained it to them. They gave me a Case #. This was 2 weeks ago. They told me the person that was handling the case would reach out to me. They also said the case would be resolved come XX/XX/XXXX. I have not heard ANYTHING from them about the case or anyone, for that matter, from Wells Fargo since that call on two weeks ago. Considering I am likely going to get charged interest again soon on the {$1400.00} that they charged me, I need this resolved ASAP."
1042,"XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Wells Fargo ) claims "" COVID '' is the reason why I had not received my statements. Last year ( 2020 ) I only received statements from XXXX - XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and it stopped, then got XXXX, then it stopped, then got XXXX, and again it stopped. 

I have repetitiously called and called - the Reps always says "" You are not enrolled in electronic paperless. '' and "" due to COVID, it is taking our customers longer than usual to receive their bill. '' In addition, been advised to log in at the website to check in case if the bill had not arrived. PROBLEM? It will NOT allow me to log in! Even after their "" New System '' requiring a new password created. I already did this ; and once that is complete, it loops back to the original position and will not recognize the new password I have created. I keep getting all these WAC errors - XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc etc etc. 

NOW, trying to use the FORGOT PASSWORD - they are demanding a STUPID PHONE, I do not have a Smart Phone, I have a landline telephone. ANOTHER NEW PROBLEM? I am profoundly XXXX, I can not get the automated code from some stupid computer to input My landline is a XXXX. I live alone. THIS IS FLAT OUT DISCRIMINATION TOWARDS THE XXXX XXXX AND XXXX. 

Just made a call today, and I was slammed with a LATE FEE? Really? After I had called last month after XXXX ( XX/XX/2020 ), She told me to call if I didn't get a billing statement next month ( XXXX ) after the XXXX. So I went ahead and paid blindly {$100.00} ( while my normal minimum is {$30.00} a month ), and today JUST GOT TOLD THAT THE LATE FEE WAS STILL ATTACHED. AND THE MINIMUM HAD DOUBLED? 

I have NO PROBLEMS with other bills, they are all incoming just as normal as everything else ... BUT NOOOOOOOOOO THE REP IS SO OBSESSED AND FOCUSED ON COVID CAUSING PROBLEMS. 

This is a leeching mode to try to gain more of the customer 's monies and blaming it on COVID by not sending bills via USPS for the sole purpose of collecting additional fees and charges to make up for the LOSS of their Online and Offline stores! 

I have ZERO tolerance for this type of practice. There is absolutely no excuse why they can not mail a customer 's bill via USPS. My Balance is fine, they are just sucking up "" late fees '' and "" jacking up minimum payments '' in an illegal tactic."
1046,"I opened a debit card account with Wells Fargo and somehow they turned it into a credit card account. I never wanted a credit card account nor did I ever agree to open a credit card account. 

I never realized until recently that I turned into a credit account. I never filled out any forms to open a credit account. 

Also, as a debit card account I would place my money into the account and use it for purchases. When they turned it into a credit account, they started it with my own money."
1047,Wells Fargo closed the account without my permission.
1050,"On XX/XX/XXXX, someone fraudulently used my Wells Fargo debit card in a liquor store for {$300.00}. On that day, I never left my house and have only one debit card which was in my pocket and is never lent to anyone. I have never been to the liquor store and had to XXXX it to even know what it was. While reviewing my bank accounts in early XXXX, I discovered the fraudulent transaction and contacted the bank. They reversed the charge and began an investigation. Claim number XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo sent me a letter ( which I got 10 days later ) saying that they had investigated and concluded that I had used or permitted someone else to use the debit card. This was based on information received from Visa - essentially that their electronic system showed a card number, pin and chip signature that matched. I was not given any information on what the card number, pin or chip signature was. I was then assessed the {$300.00}, plus {$2.00} for the use of a non-Wells ATM. 

I called the customer service number provided and was told that the bank uses the Visa data as conclusive, that I must have given the card to someone to use or had it physically stolen ( neither were true ), and that they had no ability to reverse the finding. I was told by the specialist that my only recourse is to file a police report and hope that a criminal investigation done by our local police will show something different. I was also told that I had to prove that I didn't let someone use the card - in other words, that I am a liar and have to prove an impossibility. I was also told that there was no recourse to contact VISA about the quality or details of their investigation. I was told that they would mail me their documentation. Essentially, I was shut out of any real resolution and called a liar in the process. 

We have been WF customers since XXXX and maintain multiple business and personal accounts, but will no longer do so. I was ripped off twice - first by whoever stole my card information and then by Wells Fargo. This is not the first error by Wells Fargo that we have had to address, but it will be the last."
1053,"We have tried to contact Wells Fargo multiple times about the court case associated with my Fraud Claim. Nobody has called the court, and we just want someone to talk to."
1054,"I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found 90 days late payment on the dates XX/XX/2017 to XX/XX/2017. I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."
1056,"Per FACTA and the Furnisher Rule, furnishes have the strict responsibility to supply accurate data. They are also obligated to furnish information in a way that prevents re-aging and duplicate reporting, In my case, case number # XXXX, the furnisher did not supply accurate data to my credit report. Wells Fargo failed to see that the information reported to my credit report was actually an account being re-aged. They were student loans and were just sold to a new servicer for the seventh time. As a result of Wells Fargo 's haste, other creditors, I was in good standing with, followed suit. Wells Fargo 's incredible mistake destroyed my credit in an instant. 

So I ask Wells Fargo Bank/Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, who picked up both of my mortgages with different addresses, on the secondary market, to which I paid them both off with no lates why? Including my Wells Fargo Auto Loan with the same defaulted student loan debt I was approved with when I obtained my mortgages ... .again to which I paid off the auto loan that had no lates too, ... Why? Why decrease my credit card limit? When I have proven to Wells Fargo I am a good risk ... that I managed my credit well. To which I did waaaay before Wells Fargo abruptly destroyed my credit profile on false information. I can provide documentation that my other creditors reacted in the same manner as well as closed my account. They may have the same policy but, they didn't react until Wells Fargo took the first move. 

I understand that Wells Fargo Bank can decrease my credit line for any or no reason. But Wells Fargo told me the reason ; and the reason turned out to be false. Again as a result, my credit rating had diminished and other accounts closed. 

Please note that each furnisher is required to implement their written policies and procedures concerning the accuracy and integrity of the information that they furnish to reporting agencies. 
In fact! FACTA Requires furnishers to have such procedures and policies to avoid furnishing inaccurate information ; most importantly avoid furnishing information in a way that prevents re-aging. 

But that didnt happen in my caseor did it? See Wells Fargo wouldn't know because they relied on some other furnishers reporting to be accurate ; and without hesitation Wells Fargo reacted without any investigation on their part of the truth to the reporting. 

Everything I have talked about in this letter is true and factual.

1062,"Wells Fargo is still doing deceptive banking in 2018 On XX/XX/XXXX 2018 I applied for a Wells Fargo credit card. I was approved and 5 days later ( before ) I even activated the card they WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION did a balance transfer to that card and charged me a fee of {$180.00}. I never authorized this I only applied for a new credit card at their bank. Within the cc application they asked two questions which had to be answered to move the application forward : What is your interest in applying for a Wells Fargo Card : I said, I might be interested in a balance transfer What account would you do the balance transfer for : I tried to leave it blank but the application would not go through. I tried to use a catch all phrase like a "" a XXXX XXXX account ''. Again the application would not go forward. You had to give Wells Fargo an Account number for the application. Three days later they did a banking transaction to the account number forced in my application without my permission. Then they charged me a fee of {$180.00} dollars to do it. Wells Fargo is still doing their deceptive banking tactics!!!!!!!!!!!"
1063,"I disputed a fraudulent charge on my account. Wells Fargo did not respond or send notice about anything for over 30 days. They cancelled my card after they fought the charge being fraud. Once I had provided it was a fraudulent charge they removed the charge but closed my account with no notice. I was in the middle of grocery shopping and could not use my card. When I called, they said they would send me a new card. I have not received this new card for over a month now. 

Additionally, as I had not known my account was closed since Wells Fargo never advised, I deposited a balance transfer check into my checking account. The check bounced and instead of advising the account number changed they reported it as fraud and my bank restricted my bank account. This has caused me to take an exorbitant amount of time to go to the branch and resolve this issue created by Wells Fargo. 

I have effectively been punished for reporting a proven fraudulent charge on my account, which is a violation of Reg E and XXXX and/or XXXX XXXX XXXX"
1064,"I called Wells Fargo collections department on XX/XX/20 XXXX @ XXXX to attempt to settle a balance owed on my XXXX card . The current balance is {$360.00} on an account that had an original credit line of {$100.00}, 360 % greater than the original line of credit! This was due to an outdated mailing address they had on file, which they continued to mail statements and accrue multiple late fees, without my knowledge of owing them. Prior to this, I paid all balances on time. 

I was routed to an offshore representative that stated that they can offer a 60 % settlement. I asked for a written settlement agreement, which he declined and advised he could only provide AFTER agreement to enter into settlement. I asked to speak to an on shore representative ( XXXX employee id # XXXX ), which stated she could not accept less than 60 % of the balance outstanding, I asked to be transferred to a manager ( XXXX XXXX ) who refused to settle, despite explaining what occurred and the call was ended. 

This predatory behavior WellsFargo operates under, continues to negatively impact my ability to obtain credit, despite my good intention to resolve."

I got in my credit card statement from Wells Fargo, we had signed up for assistance due to COVID-19, my husband was laid off in XXXX and we tried our hardest to keep up payments for a while and we did but eventually needed help. I got two months of assistance where I didnt have to pay my minimum payment of {$66.00}. Today I got a bill for {$220.00}, which was my minimum payment plus all the interest acquired on the total amount in the account. They didnt tell me I would have to pay all interest acquired on the total amount and my minimum payment when I was no longer receiving assistance, and I dont always have to pay all acquired interest per month so Im confused why this is happening. When I called in they just told me that it was my minimum payment and the interest on the total amount due. The only thing that they offered me was more time in the assistance program, but I did not want to come back and have to owe {$440.00} next time or something like that. And my two monthly payments which is {$66.00} each that I had missed comes to a total of {$130.00}, so I dont understand why this is happening ... ( I wan na add I knew that interest would continue to be added on the total amount, I just didnt know Id have to pay it all back when I came back. I dont have to pay all of my interest every month so Im confused why I have to pay two months worth when I needed assistance ) I attached my current bill for {$220.00} which is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and Im attaching a screenshot showing my previous payments to them. Now I pay my minimum payment and I try to pay extra whenever I can even if its {$14.00} or {$20.00} extra per month I try to pay off as much as I can. But youll see I didnt have to pay a huge {$220.00} every month youll see a consistent {$68.00} or {$66.00}. 
It was suggested to come here and file a complaint, so Ive never done this before I apologize if this is too much or too little. Thank you"

Since the company XXXX XXXX has failed to assist or address this carpet issue Ive then turned to my bank credit card company XXXX Wells Fargo ). This issue I with Wells Fargo is that they have failed to take responsibility for any errors that has taken place in the handling of my dispute.

1079,"All dates stated here are year XXXX. This is a follow-up to CFPB Complaint # XXXX. After you intervened, Wells Fargo ( WF ) did finally pay me on XX/XX/XXXX the then-remaining credit balance of {$4200.00} on my credit card. On XX/XX/XXXX, I then paid WF {$400.00} to cover a {$400.00} charge I'd made to cover a dental bill I had put on the card on XX/XX/XXXX. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, WF put a FALSE AND FRAUDULENT debit charge on the card of {$4600.00}, which I had NOT incurred and which they labelled a "" payment adjustment '', so that the card appeared to have a "" balance '' ( owing ) of {$4200.00} even though there actually was no balance owing at all. Since then, I have phoned them repeatedly, spoken to multiple Reps and multiple Supervisors on recorded lines. Each and every one of the people I spoke to, on reviewing the account, agreed that I owe WF no money, they owe me no money, and my account balance is XXXX. They have at least twice escalated the issue to Corporate, to the effect that I received a letter from Corporate dated XX/XX/XXXX saying they received my WF complaint # XXXX and I would hear from them by XX/XX/XXXX, and then a follow-up letter ( same case ) dated XX/XX/XXXX saying I "" can expect a response by XX/XX/XXXX ''. Meanwhile, sometime between XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, I got a phone call ( male, don't recall name ) who reassured me that WF agreed I have a XXXX balance, and they were working on it, and in the meanwhile until they fixed their records they would not require any minimum payment on this "" phantom '' {$4200.00} because they knew I didn't owe them any money, nor would I have to pay any Interest or any "" didn't make payment '' fees. Then last week on XX/XX/XXXX I logged on to my account, and not only was the {$4200.00} still there, but now it also demanded that I pay a {$42.00} minimum payment. When I then called again ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) the Rep "" XXXX XXXX '' said that [ 1 ] she had seen this exact kind of problem before and would send another Complaint to Corporate, and [ 2 ] if I didn't pay at least {$42.00} on this money I DID NOT OWE then WF would charge me a nonpayment fee, and [ 3 ] if I didn't pay WF the ENTIRE {$4200.00} that I didn't owe then they would charge me Interest on any "" unpaid '' amount. I then spoke to her Supervisor XXXX who told me that though she agreed ( looking at the record ) that I didn't owe WF any money and the {$4200.00} "" balance owing '' they had on my account was in ERROR, she couldn't do anything about it ; XXXX said SHE would also send another Complaint to Corporate, and XXXX told me that she could request for me a temporary "" COVID19 '' waiver of both minimum payments AND any interest charges on any unpaid balance, so that's what I did.

I received the product late XXXX which it was supposed to be done on XXXX and after I received it I sent pictures of the damaged product to the manufacturer, spend several months trying to get my money back and trying to work with them to re do my earrings if they were not going to refund my money, but it was a waste of time because they didn't respond to my messages and emails. So I called wells fargo to open a dispute and I talked to the representative and she took notes, I told her i have evidence and pictures of the damage product. She told me they are going to resolve the issue and get my money back and they sent the report to the fraud department.

1086,"This complaint is specific to Wells Fargo, a company that I have been banking with for a very long time. They are denying my claim for fraudulent charges on my Wells Fargo Business Credit Card. I was alerted to this issue on XX/XX/2019, almost two full weeks after the card was reported stolen, was closed, and I was told not to worry about the charges by the representative.

My complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has many components which I have outlined below, but first and foremost it is regarding the denial of claim for fraudulent charges made on XX/XX/2019 totaling {$22000.00} USD that now I am being held responsible for. 

Helpful people from almost every other department and branch in Wells Fargo outside of the fraud the Wells Fargo Fraud Department, have expressed disgust, surprise, and utter disappointment that I am being held responsible for these charges. 

Given the evidence supplied in the Credit Card Fraud Evidence document attached to this complaint, as well as the simple fact that their own team approved the fraud claims on my Wells Fargo Business Debit card, there is no reason to close and deny my claim. The only acceptable resolution is that all of these charges be permanently removed from my account for the Wells Fargo Business Credit Card in dispute. 

I have further complaints in the matter regarding the manipulative, unhelpful, untimely, strong-arm tactics that that fraud team resorted to when the denial was issued. I was immediately made out to be the criminal, despite being the innocent party who has been a long a valued customer. Im asking for a full review and investigation of practices used to deliver or address customers who have had a denial of fraud claims and an apology for the conduct of the fraud team. It is my opinion and the opinion of those I have spoken to within Wells Fargo at various levels that this specifically due to the dollar value of the fraud and that my claim has been denied without a proper investigation of the facts before denying the claim. 

Additionally, in the case of fraud and a police investigation into the charges, time matters. After repeated questions to the representatives who handled my case on XX/XX/XXXX, I was repeatedly told that I didnt need to worry about anything and that the charges were obvious fraud and that Wells Fargo would take care of everything. Nearly two weeks later, after I called to inquire why the fraudulent charges were placed back on my card, they suggested that I would need to potentially provide unlimited and unspecified amounts of evidence to support my case. I was also told that no matter what evidence I supplied, there would be no guarantee of any results that would positively affect the decision in my favor. This is a tactic that I believe was used to stall and make the task seem insurmountable, demeaning, and potentially fruitless in order to scare and intimidate the customer from pursuing further action. However, I immediately supplied the evidence I could gather as a civilian and launched additional police reports beyond the initial XXXX XXXX Sheriff 's report for the theft of my wallet, cards, and phone from my vehicle on XX/XX/2019. There are currently several police departments across various locations where the charges occurred investigation the matter. The fraud team repeated claims theyre unable to supply the transaction times necessary to the ongoing investigation, hampering the multiple active and ongoing police investigations. Yet the fraud supervisor read off several transaction times to me on the phone when we originally spoke. I still have yet to receive a call back from the original supervisor I had called regarding the issue, nearly a week after leaving a message with him. 

On XX/XX/2019 I spoke to two representatives in the resolution department related to my case, who promised that it would be escalated and the team would be actively working to get the denial reversed and the investigation reopened. Yet, on Monday, XX/XX/2019 when I called again, the case had yet to be assigned. When I spoke with the new representative, she took on the case, but made no promises and was sorry someone told me incorrectly that they had the power to do what the previous representative had stated. After supplying all of the evidence, I called back two hours later, only to find the representative had still failed to contact the internal fraud department, and therefore I opted to begin contacting federal authorities and watchdog groups about the case. 

RESOLUTION : Again, the only acceptable resolution is that all of the fraudulent charges filed be permanently removed from my account for the Wells Fargo Business Credit Card in dispute and that any negative marks on my business or personal credit or accounts be removed. 

A resolution does not mean that I will not continue to pursue action against Wells Fargo for the losses and harm this has caused to my business, my family, and my health. Additionally, it does not mean that I will not also pursue action to stop the abhorrent practices of Wells Fargo related to denial of claims without proper investigation. What has happened to me should never happen to anyone again. 

I have attached the list of fraudulent charges, Credit Card Fraud Evidence supplied to Wells Fargo, and additional Well Fargo complaint documentation with notes I have been keeping to build the case against Wells Fargo and support my claim."
1088,"I put my son in XXXX XXXX and they have charged me for a full month when it should only have been half. The charge was {$660.00} made on XXXX. It should have been only {$340.00} and they should give me back {$320.00}. Talk to them and although they admit the problem they do nothing to return my money. They promise to make me a check but they tell me there is no date to give it to me. It's already been 2 months. Being honest with you, it is clear that there is no intention of giving me back my money and they are waiting for me to get tired of claiming. 

I have contacted the WELLS FARGO bank with a dispute and they rejected it with the excuse that XXXX XXXX promises to make a credit but I was very clear with them that I did not need credit because my son will no longer go there. My son said they XXXX XXXX to make him put on the mask. My son has XXXX to go there. 

Due to the bank 's refusal to give me my money, I have had to turn to you. 

Keep in mind that what I am claiming is far below what they should actually return to me since the actual amount should be about {$1500.00} because they charged me for two months without my son going there and I am only claiming {$320.00}. 

I have attached an image with a red square to show the amount in dispute. 

Companies involved : WELLS FARGO XXXX XXXX XXXX Best regards."
1090,"On XX/XX/2019 I made a booking on XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX KY stay. Unfortunately during the check out the price was not discounted by {$20.00} as per offer sent to me ( attached ) despite all criteria being met. I called the Wells Fargo customer service with intention of disputing the purchase and the bank failed to dispute it. On first contact, the representative indicated that she will be the one arranging and handling the dispute and when I gave her all the info pertaining to the transaction I was told that I am going to be transferred despite what was indicated to me a few minutes earlier. When I have heard this info I requested to be transferred to the supervisor and confront the bank why the info given to me at the beginning of the call was misleading. As result of the conversation that transpired next I was told that the real motive for giving me a incorrect and misleading info was the WF to weed out unauthorized and compromised card use and not to initiate the dispute process as I am entitled to under the credit card user agreement. 
When I was finally told that I will be transferred to the dispute dept to initiate the dispute process I was put on a very long hold and then subsequently the call was disconnected. 
I got a follow up call shortly after from the CSR of which the purpose was made unclear to me. 
Personally I think it is reprehensible that the WF is preventing consumers to dispute purchase by providing not only misleading info to the consumers but using the calls for the purpose other than declared. This clearly shows the WF culture as not only contrary to what is stated as its operating procedures but perhaps even violating state and federal laws. The company should make it CLEAR what is the dispute process methodology right from the beginning instead of making the process cumbersome and misleading which I believe is done on purpose to dissuade consumers from dispute process."
1091,"Wells Fargo attempted to charge an account that I did not ask them to charge and that had been closed for over XXXX years. On XX/XX/XXXX I made an online payment of {$500.00} from my XXXX XXXX checking account ( XXXX ) to my Wells Fargo credit card. On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo sent that {$500.00} back to XXXX XXXX ( "" adjusted payments '' ) and they charged me a {$29.00} fee for a "" returned check. '' I got an alert from Wells Fargo that same day that they had received information that my XXXX XXXX account was no longer active. They showed the account number ( XXXX ) that account had been closed since XX/XX/XXXX. My XXXX XXXX account shows confirmation that I sent the {$500.00} from my currently open checking account. I complained to Wells Fargo, they said they will return the {$29.00}. XXXX XXXX has provided me documentation to show that the account was closed in XXXX and I have taken screenshots to show that my open account was used to send the payment. Wells Fargo said that they opened an investigation into the issue. Due to Wells Fargo not properly processing my {$500.00} payment, I went over my credit limit. 

While I spoke with Wells Fargo representatives, they repeatedly suggested that I had typed the wrong account number."
1092,"On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, an online payment was made from my Wells Fargo checking account to a Wells Fargo credit card. Instead of making the minimum payment as intended, the full credit card balance was paid. This error was noticed within minutes, as my checking account was almost totally depleted. We called Wells Fargo immediately, and were told no action could be taken until the payment posted to the credit card account on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. WF said a representative would call us on Monday to confirm a payment reversal. I received no such call. I called WF on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX and explained the situation. We were informed that the error would be corrected in one business day, and that the cash would be back in my checking account on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. This did not occur. On Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to at least four WF representatives, including XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( who hung up on me after transferring my call at XXXX XXXX ET on XX/XX/18 ), and XXXX XXXX ( Case Analyst Manager in the Executive Office in XXXX, AZ ). All informed me that my case could be "" escalated '' and "" investigated, '' but none could explain where my money is or when I could expect it back in my checking account. I repeatedly explained the dire financial circumstances lack of access to these funds ( approx {$2700.00} ) was creating for my family, and yet no one could explain where the money was or place the funds back in my account. I was repeatedly told that the representatives, "" understood my frustration, '' and that the "" one business day was correct, '' with no acknowledgement of their error or the bind in which I have been placed due to the lack of appearance of funds in my account. I was told by XXXX XXXX that WF "" corrects errors '' and as a policy does not compensate customers for errors made by the company. XXXX XXXX 's supervisor is XXXX XXXX, who is a Case Manager II in XXXX, AZ, but I was told she does not accept phone calls from customers."
1095,"I had fraud on my Wells Fargo Credit Card the end of XX/XX/XXXX and funds returned XX/XX/2018 in the amount of {$1200.00}, this was including the Adjustment Purchases and Interest adjustment as well and these were International charges as well. Wells Fargo replaced my card with a new one as well. On XX/XX/2018 my account showed 2 bank adjustment 's one for {$430.00} and the 2nd for {$140.00}. I saw these charges XX/XX/XXXX and called in about them. They explained that one of the International merchants had returned funds and it had gone to the old credit card number that had fraud on it originally ; the system in error did a bank adjustment on my new card and added the two amounts making me responsible in paying them back. They stated that the system would correct the error in 24 to 48 business hours. That time passed and I called back again being told the same thing, they stated that they would do a manual adjustment so those charges would be removed from my account but it never happened. I was then told in the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX when I called back that the fraud department was not allowing the correction to be made. XX/XX/XXXX I called customer care to request a case be opened as I was beyond frustrated by this situation. The customer care representative agreed that there was an error and attempted to resolve it with fraud and had no luck. He opened a case # XXXX and told me it would take a few days. A week passed and I called again XX/XX/XXXX and was told a XXXX  was assigned to it but nothing had been started yet but I would hear back from him. I still had not heard anything and called XX/XX/XXXX XXXX and spoke with a XXXX XXXX who was very helpful. She also reached out to fraud and found them to be very frustrating, she compiled an email to make clear what had happened and what needed to be done. XX/XX/XXXX she let me know she was told by a fraud manager that they  would make the corrections and would credit my account the {$570.00}. It would again take 24 to 48 business hours to complete. I checked my account on XX/XX/XXXX and saw that they did not credit my account but did a balance transfer of two amounts of {$140.00} and {$430.00} ( the original amounts that were to be removed ) as a debit to my new card. So I am now carrying a balance of {$1100.00} on my credit card that were from fraudulent charges. Wells Fargo has not fixed this error and has only made this worse. This high balance on my card is affecting my credit and I am being held responsible to pay for charges that are not mine. I will attempt to call back again to try and resolve this situation but I feel I am being victimized by Wells Fargo by them not fixing this error ( s )."
1097,"I have had a credit card account in good standing with Wells Fargo ( since it was Wachovia ~XX/XX/XXXX ). I also had a checking account that was linked to the credit card account for overdraft protection. I decided to close the checking account in XX/XX/XXXX, while both accounts were in good standing with a XXXX  balance. I spoke to a Wells Fargo representative on the phone in XX/XX/XXXX & he said he would take care of closing the account. I got a "" confirmation '' email that suggested I look for correspondence regarding my recent call in the Message Center on Wells Fargo 's website. The Message Center was empty, but I did not think anything of it at the time. I did not check back, thinking the checking account had been closed as communicated. Meanwhile, I left the credit card account open to maintain 17-18 years of good standing on that credit account. However, the checking account was never closed. Further, it needed a minimum balance, so the credit card pulled money into it each time it reached below the minimum & charged interest on itself, while adding additional late fees & overdraft fees. I was not making these charges, nor had I authorized them since I thought the checking account was closed. When I realized, around XX/XX/XXXX, that this had been happening, I disputed it. My account had been in good standing until that point. They opened case after case, didn't call me back, "" understood '' & said they would "" take care of it '' over the phone, then closed the case unfavorably without talking to me, saying I owed the money for the self-perpetuating, unauthorized charges. Each time, I was on the phone with them, they would say it was a miscommunication & would be able to take care of it. Then I would never hear from them after they opened a case & I would receive a closed case resolution letter saying I owed all the money. I kept trying to fight it & wait for them to call me back as they said they would. In XX/XX/XXXX, they did a charge back on my account. I was in good standing with them for 17-18 years. There was no reason for me not to be able to pay a ~ {$150.00} credit card bill, but it wasn't mine to pay."
1099,"I'm not sure where to begin but ill try and begin at a relevant point, over 2 years ago I wound up in a difficult life position, I needed a new home and I needed new tradelines on my credit profile. I walked into wells fargo bank and asked about getting a credit card. they declined me because no reporting trade lines ... so I opened a secured card, which I was told would be graduated in 6-12 months by the employees of the branch and is some brochures they showed me. 

I have never missed a payment and paid on time for 2 years, ive asked this card to be graduated many times over the last 18 months and each time I was told its automated. when I made deeper complaints I was refered to the office of the president case number XXXX in which I was told I would have the matter settled on no less then 3 occasions over the last 4 months and each person who contacted me and said I will have this complete in 30 days ..never heard from them again then I would respond to the original email, and a new person would tell me they would resolve the matter in 7 days and forth all the up until now 4 months later.. 

they just billed me again for the annual fee because I couldn't graduate or change products because they are fee harvesting me, I am definetly being abused in this situation and I need your help.. 

the greater point is this, I have paid the account to XXXX balance and I need the deposit to pay off another card which is not secured. these other balances are making my utilization appear higher then it really is as I move toward a refinance of my home. hurting my credit score and driving up the expected rate I will pay on a conventional mortgage..so to me there is more at stake then my deposit my wells fargo card number is XXXX"
1100,"Sometime in early XXXX I opened my Wells Fargo bank account, they had offered me a college level credit card because they stated they seen a young working man. I applied and later got the credit card, since then I believe they have been wrongfully charging me excessive fees. Finally in early XX/XX/2018 I reached out to Wells Fargo stating that I had felt that I was wrongfully charged in the fees I was receiving while having the credit card. Wells Fargo replied with a letter that I received in late XX/XX/2018 stating they would look in to the matter. In early XX/XX/2018 Wells Fargo sent me a letter stating they did not want me to take legal action because they felt they had not wrongfully charged but also stated they would take care of the credit card fees as long as I paid the remaining balance of the credit card which was {$330.00}. I paid the {$330.00} at the Wells Fargo on XXXX and XXXX XXXX in XXXX, New Mexico on XX/XX/2018. At this time I was informed there was not a remaining balance by the bank teller at this branch. On XX/XX/2018 I received multiple letters from Wells Fargo stating that at the time I had remaining balance of {$3.00} which caused multiple future credit card fees in which I refuse to pay because I was told by the bank teller that my credit account was paid off. I have informed Wells Fargo at this point I am fed up with their shady fees and have stated to them I will take legal action."
1102,"I have automatic payments enabled from my Wells Fargo checking account to my Wells Fargo Visa credit card for the minimum balance due each statement period. These minimum payments are enabled to prevent me from missing a payment. 

When I logged onto my online account on XX/XX/XXXX, I saw a banner indicating that my payment was late and to make payment as soon as possible and that my payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX. It should be impossible for me to make a late payment because I have automatic payments enabled. 

Wells Fargo posted my transaction late, despite prior payment instructions, in order to penalize me for late payments."
1103,Well Fargo Credit Card has been reported charged off for more than 6 years and they report that I still owe every month.
1105,"I was on a trip to XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, my rental car was broken into in the early morning near the beach while unattended for an hour. There were no signs of a break-in and the only thing in the car was my wallet in the glove box. Later in the afternoon i noticed that about {$50.00} dollars in bills was missing from my wallet. Having had my wallet on my person before that morning and after I concluded somebody broke into the car, scanned or copied my credit, debit, and liscence information, then proceeded to charge many things onto both of those cards. I received an email from Wells Fargo stating that there was some unusual activity on my credit card, and that a charge on my debit card was declined. At this point, I logged onto the app and froze all my cards. There were 4 charges onto my credit card, XXXX were declined by wells fargo as fraud or suspicious, and two were approved. The two declined were {$450.00} and {$1600.00} while the two approved were {$780.00} and {$1600.00}. 
On my Debit card, there were 4 attempted charges with only the first charge approved. The approved amount was {$1600.00}, and the subsequent declined charges were {$1600.00}, {$780.00}, and {$450.00}. 
I filed a fraud claim for both my debit and credit cards with Wells Fargo the same day from XXXX XXXX. The Debit card claim was approved and I was refunded the {$1600.00}. I was told that the credit card fraud would be investigated and I would hear back soon about the result. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo and was told that my credit card claim was approved and that the charges were removed from my account. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, i noticed that there was still two charges that appeared on my new credit card statement, of {$1600.00} and {$800.00} from the same "" merchant '' that all the other charges were from. Thinking that these charges were the same as before and were not credited back to me, I called wells fargo claims department and was told once again that my claim went through and that these charges would be removed from my account soon. 
Upon checking my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that those new charges still remained, with a total balance of {$2400.00} that was not authorized by me. Confused, i called wells fargo once again and was told that my claim was denied. They claimed that because i had the card in my possession the day of the fraud that these charges were authorized by me. Regardless of the two previous charges on my credit card and the charge on my debit card that were all from the same "" merchant '' that were approved and given back to me by wells fargo, they denied these two other separate charges. I filed an additional escalation of the claim and for it to be reviewed."
1106,"Earlier in XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that Wells Fargo closed my existing card with them due to inactivity. I wish I had used the card earlier to keep the line open, but I didn't. I believe the card was marked as Closed by Consumer ( Compliance Condition Code XA ) but should have been marked as Closed Due to Inactivity ( Special Comment CI ). This might be implied from the above, but I manage a bank 's credit reporting program. So if that could be fixed, I would appreciate that. But that's not the basis for the complaint. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a Wells Fargo card as I want to continue my relationship with XXXX. I was denied - I've never been denied for credit, ever. I have deep lines going back ~14 years, no debt other than my mortgage and a small XXXX student loan ( so, no revolving debt ), no delinquency, ever, and overall I am in no way a risk. Depending on the scoring model and CRA used, my scores are > XXXX, many are above XXXX. I take extremely great pride in my credit. 

I called in and asked XXXX to reconsider the denial that same night. I spoke to a sales agent - I asked to speak to a judgmental underwriter, and was advised that someone would contact me. 

Then, on XX/XX/XXXX I called in again, and was told the same thing. 

Then, today ( XX/XX/XXXX - as I am writing this ) I was told that the app was recon 'd, and the recon was denied. No one called me from judgmental underwriting. And then I was told that there are no underwriters that call customers. Also, the customer sales rep sounded like he didn't even want to be working, didn't care about my issues, and overall was just in a hurry to get me off the phone. He advised me roughly 20 minutes ago that he would transfer my call to an escalations specialist, and I am still on hold - silence, and no one has answered. 

I'm beyond frustrated with this originations process and the lack of transparency with applying for this card, and the fact that I can't speak to anyone in underwriting at XXXX regarding the matter. If someone would actually just look at my XXXX  file ( I believe you pulled XXXX ), then you would clearly see I am a 0 % risk."
1108,"I applied for a Wells Fargo credit card. They asked I go into the branch with two documents from a list, including a utility bill or renter 's insurance. I submitted confirmation of my renter 's insurance, a copy of my driver 's license and a utility bill. They refused to process the application still, instead demanding more paperwork be dropped off in the branch. They would n't even tell me whether I would be approved pending providing this paperwork."
1109,"WELLS FARGO DISREGARDED FTC RULES On XX/XX/2020 I ordered a laptop from XXXX in the amount of {$1300.00} the laptop was supposed to arrive on Friday XX/XX/2020. Exactly one week later on XX/XX/2020 I contacted XXXX about this issue they told me the package was delivered according to tracking and that I had signed for it. 

I assured them this can not be the case since I never received a package and more importantly never signed for one. They denied my claim and referred me to my card issuer bank. 

And the same day XX/XX/2020 I contacted my card this year Wells Fargo Bank. They immediately provided a temporary credit in the amount of {$1300.00}. They informed me that upon finalizing the claim that could last no longer than 90 days the temporary credit would stay permanent or fall off depending on the conclusion. This Was not the case. On XX/XX/2020 Almost 6 months after my claim was filed I received an electronic message through my Wells fargo app stating they had just reached out to XXXX 24 days prior to the letter date. They went months without doing a thing. Then on XX/XX/2020 7-8 months after I filed my claim they reversed funds I though had been resolved already. 

I contacted wells fargo and they said they declined my claim due to XXXX providing proof of shipment. Even after insisting that was not true they did not resolve it. I then proceeded to file another claim with their credit executive office on the premise of breaking FTC rules in resolving my claim in a timely manner. I did this twice. They were both declined twice with the same answer of XXXX providing proof. I would like wells fargo to take responsibility for their blatant disregard of federal rules or to charge XXXX since I never received the package. 

Thank you XXXX XXXX"

1117,"Originally victim of a scam where I was double charged for my purchases. There were XXXX legitimate transactions. I signed a receipt for both. Merchant told me they had to rerun the transactions because there wad an issue with running my card so they reran both transactions again. 

I disputed transaction with Wells but they said since I signed the receipt I need to call merchant. I called the merchant. After a XXXX XXXX of talking to random people I got a hold of the manager. Instead of reversing the transaction he just lied and said the prices were all doubled. Which is absolutely ridiculous and an obvious scam. 

I reached out to wells and explained what was going on. XXXX of their people literally said to me she knows this is a scam but there's nothing they will do. This double charge is {$3600.00} mind you. So wells was totally fine letting me just get robbed of {$3600.00} and letting me figure it out. This after XXXX XXXX  of perfect pay on multiple trade lines with them. They told me unless I come up with new info they wouldn't help me. 

I got copies of the receipts and documents from transactions and pointed out an obviously forged signature on XXXX of them. I sent them copies of my uber receipts showing time I left. I've sent screenshots showing people verifying in XXXX reviews the pricing me and merchant agreed upon. They have ignored this info. I've asked for the person investigating my issue to call me each time I was promised a phone call but they never do. 

I reached out to the XXXX XXXX  to try and get a referral for a lawyer to sue the merchant. I've called multiple lawyers myself to try and get this handled. After a time I decided I will just pay as much as I can so my perfect credit stops getting damaged and because I had spent over XXXX XXXX XXXX stressing about this. 

When I called wf and asked for settlement options the person I spoke to ran me through a calculator. After I had answered literally just the XXXXXXXX question she influenced me to change my answer. Ultimately I was declined a settlement. When I asked why they would rather me just charge the card off she said it's because they can write the loss off in their taxes. 

I had to liquidate my IRA so I could pay off the transaction and it still was not enough to cover the late fees and interest accrued while I was fighting the transaction. 

Wells is the ultimate example of apredatory and irresponsible lender They gave the merchant an opportunity to scam me. They're allowing me to be victimized by the merchant by not reversing the double transaction. They're also profiting off of the scam by trying to collect interest and late fees accrued while trying to resolve this. On top of that the customer service has been horrible. I never get the calls I've been promised and their responses are delayed allowing more fees and interest to accrue."

https : //www.wellsfargo.comXXXX I made a qualifying purchase on XX/XX/XXXX, and three billing cycles have elapsed ( XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX ) and I have not received the bonus. Wells Fargo is not honoring its contract.

1122,"I have a XXXX dollar balance on one of my two WELLS FARGO Visa cards. This card is closed. I cant get out from under this balance. I have been paying on this card for two years. I get at least XXXX a month in fees. I want to pay this debt but seems IMPOSSIBLE. Also I can no longer view my account including payments made, interest charged etc. I am told I can no longer access this account? The bank will not work w me in any way, even though I have been a customer for 20 plus years and have always paid my debts."
1124,we went into wells Fargo to close all of our accounts due to there practices we successfully closed all of the accounts or thought we did the bank and there credit card department even told us they were all closed and the amount 's we had to pay to close all of them. we paid the exact amount they gave us on XX/XX/XXXX at a local branch and via phone with credit card department at the local branch. we even ask if all of out accounts were closed and the card was cancelled and we were told yes. today XX/XX/XXXX we received a notice from them telling us that there is an outstanding balance of XXXX so I call the bank. to find out how we could have a balance outstanding when we took extra effort to insure that all moneys owe was paid on XX/XX/XXXX.. they inform us that they did not inform us of a pending transaction that hit the account the exact same day we closed the account an we still owe XXXX for a transaction that took place after the card was closed. I ask for specific 's of day and time this transaction took place all they could tell me was it took place on the XX/XX/XXXX some time after we closed the accounts
1127,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Wells Fargo indicating that my contact information had been updated on my account. I contacted Wells Fargo and informed them that I had not made the update. Wells Fargo closed my account and proceeded to mail new credit cards to me. I logged into my online account, I created a new username and a new 32 character password. I then changed the erroneous information back to the correct information. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I receive another email from Wells Fargo indicating that my contact information had been updated. Again, I contacted Wells Fargo about this unauthorized change. The customer service department transferred me to the online department, the online department transferred me to the fraud department, the fraud department transferred me to the phone bank department, the phone bank department transferred me to an escalation department which turned out to be a customer service rep for checking and savings and could not do anything for me except transfer me back to customer service for credit cards. The phone call on XX/XX/XXXX lasted 51 minutes as I had to explain the whole issue to each new person I was transferred to. 

I would like Wells Fargo to explain to me who/why is my account being updated without authorization. Is it truly a hack of my 15 character username/32 character password just 48 hours after they were created where the only change made to my account is a phone number? Or is it a change being made by a Wells Fargo employee/system, and why is it being made?"
1129,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, KS XXXX XXXX XXXX, Wells Fargo Dear CFPB, I am disputing an item on my last statement, dated XX/XX/18 because I believed I was misinformed of the promotion that XXXX XXXX store was offering us on their no interest rate for 18 months credit card at that time. Last year, my fianc and I came into XXXX located in the XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX to shop to purchase wedding rings. Once we decided to purchase the rings, I was planning to place the purchase on my personal credit card, but the sales rep informed us that they had a great promotion on their in-house credit card that doesnt charge interest for 18 months. It sounded too great to pass up. So, we inquired some more information on it to make sure we knew what the agreement was. The sale rep assured us that there would be no interest for 18 months and after that period all we had to do was pay the monthly interest and the balance. We thought it was a great deal so that way we can use more money towards our wedding. 
So, after the 18 months was over. We received our XX/XX/2018 statement with a balance of {$3700.00} with an interest charge of {$4300.00}. Coming to a total of {$8100.00}! We just thought it was a mistake for the interest charge. We called the credit card company and found out that there is a roll back interest charge since we did not pay off the balance within the 18 months free interest rate period. We were furious with the false advertisement that the store had given us so I immediate cancelled the credit card and requested to speak to management. I explained the situation to the manager on the shift saying how the sales rep mislead us and use deceptive marketing practice to lure us in with the promotion they offered but did not explain all the cost involved if it was not paid off within the 18-month free interest period. If that was the case, we would have used our own personal credit card if we had known or even pay off the balance before the free interest rate period expired. The manager on duty explained over the phone that it was in the contract and there wasnt anything that they could do but they can give us a discount if we were able to pay the balance in full in a set time. To me, I feel like they were well trained for this scenario and it seems like it wasnt a first time a customer called to complain about the roll back interest charge or their last. 
We agreed to the terms for the discount and have since than paid the amount of {$7000.00}. So, if the sales rep had explained this to us in person last year. We could have used our personal credit card or even pay off the balance before the promotion had expired. Please assist us in getting a refund on the interest we paid. We believe its only fair we not be charged for the roll back interest given that we paid off the entire credit card balance as soon as we discover the promotional rate they promised was false advertising."
1130,"Wells Fargo did not allocate payments properly. They also invented 0 % expiration dates on balance transfers twice. 

My XXXX XXXX, XXXX statement showed XXXX balance transfer segments : the first with 0 % interest ending on XXXX XXXX, XXXX with {$3500.00} owed, the second ending on XXXX XXXX, XXXX with {$2500.00} owed, and the third on XXXX XXXX. XXXX with {$2100.00} owed. These are all correct. I made a payment for {$100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, which met their minimum payment of {$83.00}. I also made a payment of {$3500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. Both payments were made during the same statement period. Wells Fargo policy and Federal requires that any amount over the minimum payment go toward the segment with the highest interest rate. Wells Fargo divided up the {$3500.00} payment between all three segments. The first segment 's 0 % rated had expired on XX/XX/XXXX, and was at 22.99 % on XX/XX/XXXX when my payment was received. My XXXX XXXX, XXXX statement showed that the payment was not directed to the first segment as it should have been. It also showed the first segment 's 0 % rate expiring on XX/XX/XXXX. I have never made a balance transfer with a 0 % rate expiring on that date. I checked all my statements that year, and it did not exist until it appeared on the XXXX statement. 

After receiving my XXXX statement, I called Wells Fargo customer service and spoke to XXXX. She said she would elevate my complaint to a higher level, and gave me a case # XXXX. She said I would hear back in 10 days. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MN XXXX. Phone # XXXX, no email address. She gave the case a new case ID # XXXX. This letter reiterated the facts that were in my complaint, yet she did not reallocate the payment to the first segment. She also did not address the issue of the invented 0 % expiration date in the first segment. I called daily, leaving messages for a call back, and have never received a call from her. I wrote her a letter on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX stating my position, including statements and her letter. 

I have since received my XX/XX/XXXX statement. It shows I made payments of {$100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, and {$2500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. Here again, the payments were divided amongst the segments, and yet another invented 0 % expiration date was shown on the second segment to be XX/XX/XXXX. That payment should have gone to the second segment which had a 0 % rate expiring XX/XX/XXXX, and at 22.99 % when the payment was received. I have never made a balance transfer with A 0 % rate expiring on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I presume that Banks are required to follow Federal law concerning where payments are allocated. I also presume that they are not allowed to invent 0 % expiration dates on balance transfer segments that were never made by me. I feel that I have made every effort to get Wells Fargo to correct both issues on my XXXX and XXXX statements and credit my account for any interest charged after XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. They have done neither, leaving me with no other way to contact them. I feel that they have purposely made this a dead end, with no further way to contact them."
1131,"Ive been with Wells Fargo since 1988. When Covid started, I started using my credit cards more but Ive never been late on a payment. This past year, I was struggling financially especially this past year so Ive had to take some additional steps with personal loans, card purchases, etc but im getting a bonus to pay a lot of it off in XXXX. I know Ive had overdraft transactions but Ive never been late with Wells Fargo and Im seen high risk but to go from a XXXX credit limi to XXXX to XXXX in a year is ridiculous. Its impacted my credit score dramatically and as Im working on getting myself back up on my feet, i attempted to resolve this with Wells Fargo awhile back via XXXX and they told me to write to request an increase which was denied. I am requesting my limit be increased as I have been a loyal customer with Wells Fargo. Again, i understand a decrease but by this much? Please rectify"
1132,"I opened a secured credit card account with Wells Fargo in XX/XX/2009. I was told that my account would be periodically reviewed and that if my account history was good for one year, my secured account would be graduated to an unsecured account, and my {$1000.00} secured deposit would be returned to me. I have had a good credit history with them since the account was opened, with the exception of the events described below, but my account remains secured and Wells Fargo still has my money. I have never had a problem qualifying for credit since XX/XX/2009, but I think Wells Fargo will never graduate my account. I do not want to simply close the account, because in doing so, I will be closing my oldest credit account, which will adversely impact my credit score. I would like my money back, however, and for Wells Fargo to honor our agreement. 

I have tried contacting Wells Fargo about my graduation status, but apparently the review procedure for secured accounts is a secretive and/or completely randomized process that nobody in the entire company understands or can disclose. I have been contacting them for at least three years trying to make some headway, but I haven't been able to make any progress. 

I also think this may be retaliatory in nature. When I opened the account, the teller who assisted me was uninformed and created a situation. He took my secured deposit, opened a savings account with the deposit, and set up my credit card for autopay from the savings account. I expressed my concern that I didn't think I could use the security to pay the monthly statement, but he assured me that I could. Two to three months later, my card was declined, and I followed up with the branch, discovering that my card had been shut off for failure to make a payment. It was then that I discovered that I had been correct about the security deposit, as Wells Fargo had withdrawn the entirety of the deposit shortly after the account was opened, and the automatic payments were being drawn from an empty account. I was upset with the branch, demanded that they refund the overdraft fees and close the savings account, which they obliged. Because I closed their account, I think they are refusing to graduate my credit card and refund my secured deposit."
1134,"while a customer at Wells Fargo Bank. i had a debit card and a credit card and had wanted fraud protection because of fraud i had before from a bank in Montana. and all this happened at least a year or two before Wells Fargo was in the paper for many issues of wrong doings. i would come into the XXXX XXXX branch when i started noticing issues with both my debt card and credit card. i would notice while using my debit card the charge would be on my credit card as well and the other way as well. the people would change my cards out several times but it wouldn't never help or fix the issue ... during the times of changing out my cards they never added back on my fraud protection.after time went by, while going through some physical issues. it wasn't a long time after being charged a lot of fees i was almost at an amount where it was maxed out and there were charges added above the max amount and i told them again this was fraud and they took off the amount that was over and had told me that i need to pay the rest. even though the whole time these cards were getting false charges. and then never got a late payment letter or in any way never got informed of anything. for years my credit was in the XXXX ish amount it wasn't till i was trying to get a XXXX XXXX  XXXX  and when i called up to see why i wasn't approved they keep telling me i was in charge off mode. even though my credit was in the seven hundreds and when i looked up my credit i only would get the two credit company 's and i didn't get XXXX  and then when i looked up my XXXX  credit it said charge off and hit me with a low score. know i didnt know how to fix this or who to talk to. until now. because of how all this was dealt with and handled i'm writing this complaint"
1135,"This complaint is in regards to My  XXXX  Store card. I received a letter in the mail that my  XXXX  store card was closed due to non-payment of a {$35.00} balance. The card is issued by Wells Fargo Bank. I contacted the bank and spoke with account specialist   XXXX   in the collection department. I informed the representative that I did not receive a monthly bill as I always do and why did it take 3 months for the bank to notify Me of the past due amount.
<P/>
I was told that my account was switched to electronic statements and the representative told me that there is no notes in the system to indicate that the customer ( Me ) requested electronic statements. Now Wells Fargo Bank is asking me to pay late fees and interest of {$130.00} for a balance that was {$35.00}. This is very disturbing to me, I have always paid my bill faithfully and this bank wants to rob me of my hard earn dollars.
<P/>
The representative removed one late fee and I went ahead and paid the {$100.00} because I did not want this to ruin my good credit history because of a {$35.00} dispute. No company should be allowed to deceive any consumers in this way, if the consumer did not request electronic statements then no company should not be allowed to get away with doing these things.
<P/>
If Wells Fargo bank did not received my payment of {$35.00} and I have always paid on time, perhaps a letter and a phone call would 've been more appropriate to send immediately to the consumer but no they did not do anything until interest and late fees racked up. This is shameful and bad business practice on their part and I would truly appreciate if you could look into this matter further. Thank you for your time.

1136,"I put {$10000.00} into a secured credit card with Wells Fargo. After nearly XXXX years, they would not release the funds and extend my credit. 

I paid all my bills on time, I had XXXX fico and kept my debt ratio below 30 %. They would still deny releasing my funds and would not give me ANY reason for the denial. 

About a month ago I walked into Wells Fargo and needed my money back because I am going through a divorce. I told the banker they can either do 2 things. 

1. release my money and extend the credit. 

2. I close the account entirely. 

The banker advised 1 - me if I wanted to close the account it would take XXXX days. 

2 - for a {$400.00} fee they would release the funds for me today and extend my credit. 

I left the bank feeling like the problem had been solved even though I paid {$400.00} to have them release my funds and extend my credit. About a week later, I went to my online banking and saw that my secured credit card was maxed out and the credit had in fact not been extended. 

Now they have already charged me {$400.00} after misinforming me, and now a further XXXX interest fee. The bank advised me that I would have to pay {$600.00} by the XXXX if I want to stay in good credit standing. 

I NEVER intended to do a XXXX XXXX only to close the account if they were not going to release my funds and extend my credit."
1137,"This complaint is associated with Wells Fargo Bank. I have had multiple accounts with Wells Fargo including a VISA credit card. Over time, I accumulated points by using that card. Recently I attempted to redeem rewards online without success. I went to a local Wells Fargo Bank to find out what was going on. I was told that Wells Fargo closed my VISA account. They maintained that I hadn't used the account for some time and that they sent a letter to me notifying me that the account would be closed. I have no knowledge of any notice and, according to my card, it is not set to expire until XX/XX/2018. The person at the branch was also told that since my account was cancelled, all of my accumulated points were cancelled, as well, even though my online account still states that the points are valid. The person at the branch attempted to get a copy of the letter purported to have been sent to me but was told that a copy of that letter was not available."

1140,"Wells Fargo has again issued a debit card without our request that would access our savings account. It also happened about 2 years ago. It is very upsetting because we didn't ask for it and it accesses our savings account. We already have debit cards that access our checking account. Like we told them last time, we don't want the card and we were upset that a debit card would access our savings account. We have had debit cards compromised before, which seems to happen easily at gas stations and ATM 's per our experience and reading about other people 's experiences. 
Even if our debit cards or checking account are compromised, we don't want the bad guys to access the money in our savings account. Both 2 years ago, and today, they canceled the card and confirmed that our debit cards can not access our savings account. But it seems very wrong to issue credit cards without our request, especially credit cards that access savings accounts! 
We don't need any response or action, but Wells Fargo should stop doing this! 
Thank you, XXXX"

Today XX/XX/XXXX, less than XXXX weeks from the above mentioned direct request, I am reporting that Wells Fargo has issued a card with a different account number that was received at my address. This is Wells Fargo intentionally circumventing my direct request to cease having active cards issued for this account. XXXX. 

The document attached to the new card suggests this new card is attached to the same credit account under my name but has changed some of the numbers on the card face. Issuance of this card suggests Wells Fargo is attempting to keep the account active against my wishes and collect on fraud, both represent fraud. 

I will not be activating this card. I consider this activity clear evidence Wells Fargo is in the business of making money through deception and/or fraud."

1147,"In XX/XX/ 2019 I attempted to close all of my accounts with Wells Fargo which included a credit card with an ending balance of {$2000.00}. I was closing these due to the horrible customer service and lack of customer care. Having moved all my accounts, I was getting contacted by WF and I assumed that it was in efforts to win back my business. Instead, I find out in the process of buying a house that WF accepted two more months of ACH revolving charges and was charging me late fees and interest which they reported to the credit bureaus. This brought my middle score from XXXX to XXXX. The total amount for actual charges was approximately {$120.00}. In XXXX  I called the branch multiple times to inform them of their mistake of taking ACH payments on a closed card. The branch tried to reduce the 'fees ' but said they could not do anything about the interest. I said that I should not have any fees on a closed account. At this point, nothing was said to me by the branch about my credit card status. After many hours on the phone, I finally was offered to call the 'executive ' branch of Wells Fargo to file a complaint. This process takes 10 days they say. A girl named XXXX at ext XXXX managed the case # XXXX. After many days, XXXX said that I never close my credit card account! She also said that was why thay took the extra payments. I told her that was not the case and that I close all accounts on the same day. She said that was not what their records indicated. Wells Fargo offered to reduce the late fees but not the interest and thats where we stand as of today. M|With all the negative press that WF has had recently, I wondered how many other people this was being done to. If you go into a branch to close an account and they do not really close it, that's a new source of revenue in late fees and interest.???"

This amount was removed from my XXXX acct and credited to wells fargo - they acknowledge having it but will not clear my account. I have escalated this to senior customer service at wells fargo none of whom speak clear english I never did get an answer as to why it takes 14 days or what the magical number is that then indicates they place your money into the hold. Wells fargo clearly have not learned anything from thier recent bad press about customer service!
1150,Received letter dated XX/XX/2023 From Wells Fargo NA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Subject : Decision about your credit card application # XXXX. Person was applying for XXXX XXXX XXXX credit account. Application was denied : unable to authenticate identity of applicant. After reviewing my credit report hard inquiry was done on XX/XX/2023. This was not me and I am concerned that my identity was used.
1151,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was told by a Wells Fargo banker that I had perfect credit and thus qualified for their Visa Signature card. He explained that this was an extremely difficult card to qualify for and had a 0 % interest rate as long as I made the minimum monthly payments. This same banker also told me that I needed to open three accounts with him to avoid monthly service fees, so I opened the credit card account. He asked me to electronically sign on the penpad in agreement to his verbal description without showing me the agreement on his monitor which turned out to be quite different.

Turns out the banker ( name not provided by WF, they said I'd need a subpoena ) had lied in order to open the extra account, likely influenced by Wells Fargo 's "" employee sales goal program '' craze that was controversially implemented at that time. Three years later, my financial situation shifted and I set my account to auto-pay the minimum to keep the interest rate at zero until my income resumed. The 0 % interest had actually applied only the first 12 months, regardless of paymen
t plan, and so my balance began to rise, compound, and rise faster.

I have filed six complaints with Wells Fargo ; they "" misplaced '' two of them, and took over a month to "" investigate '' each one, with the time lengthening with each complaint. They also transferred my phone calls from office to office and "" dropped '' my call without a return number so I would have to re-explain my whole story to the next customer service representative. It is clear they were retaliating and stalling to build more interest as the months wore on. 

I have XXXX and I'm on the spectrum, so I don't do well with battling bureaucracy and it escalated to the point that I began having panic attacks on the phone with customer service and even when attempting to log online to pay my bill. I called their XXXX comment line listed on Wells Fargo 's Accessibility webpage to ask for XXXX accommodation, but it turned out to be a bogus number, directing me to the executive office who admitted they didn't have an ADA hotline. 

Each letter I got from Wells Fargo in response to the complaints I filed were filled with condescending reassurances about Wells Fargo "" building better every day '' and "" appreciate the opportunity to serve your financial needs ''. They also say that they need time to review my complaint and I should expect a response in a month ( including time for mail delivery, which is their sole method of complaint correspondence ). The most recent letter I received was regarding a complaint filed XX/XX/XXXX and they said I can expect a response by XX/XX/XXXX. That is three entire months of interest they are charging me while they "" consider '' refunding my interest. 

Their solution to my request for XXXX accommodation was a rather insulting letter exalting their conformity to the ADA and suggesting that I can receive assistance by walking into any Wells Fargo branch office. First, there aren't any Wells Fargo offices in Massachusetts and barely any in all of XXXX XXXX. Second, telling someone with social XXXX to walk into a bank who has caused him to suffer XXXX XXXX when confronted with financial stress shows a shameful misunderstanding of my request from my six complaints. In mid-XX/XX/XXXX this year, one of the Wells Fargo customer service representatives agreed to reimburse me for costs in hiring a third-party XXXX advocate, but they later denied the conversation when I asked for it in writing, and told me I'd need a subpoena to access their phone recording for "" quality assurance ''. The guarantee I finally got in writing was very different from the one we had made over the phone from which I hired a XXXX advocate that Wells Fargo will probably refuse to reimburse me for."
1153,"XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX through Wells Fargo decreased my line of credit from {$2900.00} to {$1000.00}. This was done because my account was considered inactive.

Wells Fargo did not contact me prior to making the reduction in the credit line. I was advised through my XXXX account a change had been made in my credit limits. I started calling Wells Fargo on After several calls to XXXXWell Fargo I received a letter acknowledging my contacting the company. 

I talked with XXXX on XX/XX/1922 who stated a letter from Wells Fargo was mailed to me on XX/XX/22. I have yet to receive that letter. He escalated my complaint to Wells Fargo and I talked with XXXX.

1160,"To whom it may concern : I have a dispute with Wells Fargo that began on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have two ( 2 ) Visa cards from Wells Fargo. One is a debit card associated with my personal checking account, the other is a credit card associated with my XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX a company called XXXX initiated a charge-back of {$65.00} to my debit card, and charged an equal amount to my XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card. The person at XXXX who initiated the charge-back told me that if I had an urgent need for the funds, that Wells Fargo could expedite the charge-back process. Regrettably, Wells Fargo refused to provide this service. 

My complaint about this issue was escalated to XXXX XXXX at Wells Fargo Customer Care Executive Services. XXXX XXXX stated that she could not accommodate my request. I stated that my need for an expedited charge-back was due to a XXXX XXXX, and that that my request was for a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  XXXX XXXX stated that Wells Fargo did not have an obligation to accommodate my XXXX. 

I asked XXXX XXXX to provide me with contact information for the regulatory agency that I could file a complaint against Wells Fargo with. It is my understanding that banks are required to provide this information to customers who ask for this information. Regrettably, XXXX XXXX refused to provide me with this information. I stated to XXXX XXXX that she was refusing to comply with Federal law by refusing to provide me with this information. XXXX XXXX replied that she was not refusing to do anything. I replied that XXXX XXXX was indeed engaging in an act of refusal. 

XXXX XXXX finally agreed to escalate this issue to Wells Fargo Case Management, and she stated that this department of Wells Fargo would contact me by telephone on XX/XX/XXXX. I stated to XXXX XXXX that I would not file complaints against Wells Fargo with the government before XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX, and that Wells Fargo should be sure to get back to me before this time of day. 

At XXXX XXXX  I received a telephone call from XXXX XXXX of Wells Fargos Consumer Case Management Executive Office. XXXX XXXX spoke to me in an abusive tone of voice that escalated in intensity over the course of our unpleasant conversation.

Unfortunately getting back to work did not help much as it required me to work out of state for nearly a year. The added expense meant I was no longer able to make my minimum payments on my Wells Fargo credit card.

Hence, Wells Fargo is discriminating against any and all people with APO 's because they fail to have a method to "" qualify "" the applicants. 

In pursuing this I wound up making several other phone calls and writing letters. 
One phone call in particular was almost 2 hours ( 1 hr 56 min ) before I hung up and went to bed, The time difference between me and the States is that I am 6 hrs ahead of EST.

Wells Fargo is only able to verify aplicants in the states using a 10 digit US phone number. 
I am not in the states and do not have a 10 digit US number that I can receive messages on.

I met the spending requirement and paid it off on XX/XX/2018. At about this time I received on offer to get 1.5 % cash back on my card. This did not make sense because I signed up for the card to get the cash back, and should have received cash back for all purchases as soon as I started spending I called to see what the issue was, they told me I didn't sign up for the bonus, although I clearly clicked the link and the rep was familiar with the bonus. The rep suggested that because I met the requirements I file a dispute, I did so on XX/XX/XXXX. When I never heard from them I called XX/XX/XXXX, they said they have still not got to the dispute and I needed to wait. I never heard from them again, so I called on XX/XX/XXXX. They again said it had not been looked at but sent it to a research reference team to see if I had met the qualification for the bonus ( which I clearly did ), and they would get back to me in 10 days. After not hearing from them for nearly a month I called on XX/XX/XXXX. At this point they gave me a case number and said I would be contacted in 24 hours. I have not heard from them. I took the initiative every time. They never contacted me back once. Every time I was told something different, however two reps told me since I met the requirements it will be honored, but that has not happened.

1181,"A credit card fraud dispute for a fraudulent {$2400.00} charge from a merchant who is a California State Bar Licensed Attorney, named XXXX XXXX XXXX, license # XXXX has been opened, denied, re-opened, re-denied and re-opened and re-closed by Wells Fargo for the past 2 years. The way such charge was placed on my credit card is still unknown as Wells Fargo still doesn't wish to disclose those facts to me, the credit card holder. After 2 years I still do not know how my credit card was charged : I don't know if it was manually swiped, used over the internet, entered in a specific paper form or charged over the phone. Wells Fargo would not disclose those information and still actively refuses to keep me in the loop. Again, the claim was opened, closed and reopened and denied and reopened infinite times in the past two years. Allegedly, the fraud claim was initially denied because the merchant was able to "" verify '' sufficient information. After months and years of complaining, Wells Fargo finally decided to disclose what specifically were those information that were successfully "" verified '' : to my deepest shock, the information were just my first and last name, the credit card number and allegedly also my phone number when I specifically stated that my entire backpack was stolen with my notes, agenda, wallet, smartphone with case with IDs and cards and therefore, obviously, all my information were compromised and completely exposed to easy fraudulent activity. My phone could be fraudulently used to make and receive phone calls on my behalf, my card could be fraudulently used, my signature could be copied very easily and so forth and so on. Years later, a large amount of new evidence was found and presented to Wells Fargo, yet it was either completely ignored or never received as Wells Fargo is still refusing to confirm the list of exhibits that they received and reviewed so far from me and from all the other parties involved in this case. Wells Fargo has finally denied again my claim, this time due to allegedly matching my signature "" on file '' with the signature allegedly captured and used by the merchant to charge my credit card, while even the merchant admitted in writing that someone stole my identity, pretend to be me and fled the country, and even invited me to put him in contact to Wells Fargo, promising he would cooperate to make sure I get my money back, only to later on, deny such cooperation after accusing me of wanting to "" enrich my self '' and wanting to collect twice the credit card charge refund since in the merchant 's knowledge and opinion Wells Fargo "" obviously already refunded me '' which sadly couldn't be more far from the truth. Wells Fargo refused to understand that my signature could be easily copied and reproduced, something that even the merchant understood and claimed yet Wells Fargo still refuses to provide me with a copy of such signature they allegedly have on file for me and ultimately, they even refuse to confirm if they received all the new evidence regarding the case, including a third party affidavit, a written statement made under penalty of perjury declaring that the credit card charge, that was never for legal services intended for me, the credit card holder, but rather for legal services allegedly rendered to that specific third party, were actually never rendered as promised in the agreement, making the whole charge invalid, regardless of the legitimacy of the fraud claim and regardless of the validity of the signature on the retainer fee agreement that is also, a document that is completely fraudulent, illegal and invalid as no one other than the actual client is allowed to sign and agree to be legally represented by an attorney and of course a State Bar complaint against the attorney was also filed this month, however, it can take up to one year for the State Bar to complete the investigation. At this point, after two years I am only left with the option of filing an external complaint and of course, filing legal action against Wells Fargo, however, Wells Fargo is also not cooperating as far as the available legal remedies to their customers. I should be made aware of any arbitration clause allegedly signed by me and or any other restriction to sue in small claims as this amount does not allow and justify to file a lawsuit in the Superior Court and/or hire a lawyer like Wells Fargo suggested."

The representative offered me a 'payment plan '. This was quite silly because I didn't say I had any problem paying, I just had an issue with the interest rate being usurious. 

The representative reiterated that no adjustments were being made in interest rate, but I could do a balance transfer with a 4 percent fee on the balance transferred for a 2.9 % 12 mos period. Again, that didn't address the issue of the overall rate being so high and usurious.

It seems Wells Fargo continues to ignore Consumer protection legislation. Very sad."

1191,"I have a store credit with XXXX XXXX XXXX which is thru Wells Fargo. If I would have known before applied wouldn't have done it. I am a going paying customer. My bill is due on the XXXXbof every month. I received a billed stating that I have a {$29.00} fee which I didn't understand. I called customer service and stayed my issue. Customer service representative stated yes I was a good paying customer and she couldn't help as well as her supervisor. I was told and quote "" Go to the bank and ask them to take it off. I was shocked and it was documented on my call either written or recorded. The bank stated she knew better than to tell me that. I have decided once I pay off this bill with the furniture store I will probably get rid of this account. Wells Fargo doesn't work for me"
1200,"Wells Fargo broke the law by : 1 ) increasing APR on my credit card without any reason - no monthly payment missed by me ever, no any other problems with paying off from my side 2 ) not notifying me properly about the APR increase 3 ) not giving me an opportunity to opt out the changes in the original terms in my agreement with them and not sending me a 45-day advance notice about the increase in APR.

The initial APR on the credit card with wells Fargo was 26.49 %, which was already ridiculously abnormal for a regular credit card with a major bank. 

Then that APR began changing, without any reason and proper notification of me, as follows : XX/XX/2018 : 27.24 % XX/XX/2018 : 27.49 % XX/XX/2018 : 27.74 % Total increase in APR is 1.25 % By filing this claim I opt out all the increases in APR and dispute the difference in APR charged by Wells Fargo on my account."
1201,"opened an account with wells fargo and notice lately they have the delaying the processing of the charges to confuse with the balance and become victim of fees, the account was assessed and insufficient charge {$35.00} today XX/XX/2017 and even I deposited the amount to cover the overdrawn which took 4 days to appear {$80.00} but made on the XX/XX/XXXX. I never sign for overdraft protection for this account and in the past when no funds available just do n't pay it. now somehow with the fraudulent staff they have they have turned on the overdraft protection on the account without my consent. and now they are charging the insufficient funds. 
I have tried to send the mails through their mobile website and it freezes when filling the form and when hitting the send button nothing happens, I feel I am being victim of fraudulent tactics by this bank to hurt my credit and profit illegally from me. 
I want to close this account and the insufficient charge reversed.

1205,"BEING A VICTIM OF AN IDENTITY THEFT, I HAVE COMPLETED MY IDENTITY THEFT REPORT AND I HAVE ALSO CONTACTED WELLS FARGO FRAUD TEAM AT XXXX XXXX AND SPOKE WITH XXXX   AND I HAVE OPENED A FRAUD CLIAM WITH THEM AS WELL. THIS SECURED CREDIT CARD WAS OPENED FRAUDULENTLY, THIS ACCOUNT WAS NEVER MAINTAINED BY ME ITS A CLOSED CREDIT CARD WITH XXXX BALANCE. SOMEONE STOLE MY INFORMATION AND OPENED A FRAUDULENT SECURED CREDIT CARD. I HAVE ALSO MAILED MY IDENTITY HTEFT REPORT TO XXXX AND TO WELLS FARGO TO HAVE THIS ACCOUNT REMOVED FROM MY CREDIT REPORT."
1206,"I have requested, on numerous occasions, to have my credit card accounts closed. I have done everything Wells Fargo has asked and they still refuse to close the accounts that have fraudulent activity and they've not credited my account fully for the reported fraudulent activities. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I woke to find fraudulent charges on my account ending in XXXX. The first email stated that a XXXX XXXX added my card to their pay app. This email was received at XXXX XXXX. The code was supposed to be verified by my phone number ending in XXXX. It wasnt verified because I was sleeping. I then received another email at XXXX XXXX stating that the card was successfully added to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I received another email at XXXX XXXX that my phone number had been changed. At XXXX XXXX I received another email stating my email address had been updated with a new address. When I awoke and saw these messages, I immediately called Wells Fargo. It was XXXX XXXX eastern standard time. I was told that the card would be closed and a new card would be issued. After I made the phone call, I changed my information on the Wells Fargo online access and changed my account password. I even added 2 step verification. I am no longer able to get into my own account without getting a text code sent to my cell ending in XXXX. Additionally, I filed a police report. 

There were charges in the amount of approximately {$670.00}. These charges were all completed in XXXX CA to XXXX and XXXX store XXXX. A charge made at a later time at a XXXX in MN was declined. The fraudulent information put onto my account included an email and phone number - XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX 


On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, I received a voice text stating that there was suspicious activity on card ending in XXXX. I didnt understand as I didnt have a card with those digits. I called Wells Fargo and was told that my account ending XXXX was still open and that I must have received the replacement card ending in XXXX because charges had been placed on that account as well. I responded that that was impossible given this card was issued just yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) when I noticed fraudulent activity and hadn't even been mailed. I did not have the card and I wanted the account closed. I was told that the account would not be closed. I stated that I wanted all accounts closed and that those charges were fraudulent. I didnt even know what the new card number was until that phone call, and I only knew the last 4 digits. I was denied a closure on my accounts until I went to a bank. Since the closest Wells Fargo is in CT or NY, I was told I could go to a non Wells Fargo Bank. A restriction was placed on the card. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I went to my local bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX Maine. A very nice associate, XXXX XXXX, assisted me. I was verified, the bank was verified and I was told that account ending in XXXX was closed. When I asked about closing account ending in XXXX, Wells Fargo said it didn't exist and that the phone message I received was a phishing message. Meanwhile, while I was at the bank, another charge came through account ending in XXXX, but was declined. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email stating that my new card ending in XXXX was in the mail. I immediately called Wells Fargo. Given that I had received a phone message earlier that there was suspicious activity, was told by Wells Fargo that this card didn't exist, and was told by Wells Fargo that their number was a phishing scam, I demanded the account be closed and the fraudulent charges be taken care of. I was again told I needed to go to a bank, even a non Wells Fargo bank to be verified and have it closed. Meanwhile, because Wells Fargo refused to close the account, more charges came in. My information was again being changed online through the Wells Fargo site, even after changing my password and adding 2 step verification. I received an email at XXXX XXXX   stating that my number had been changed and all of my security alerts had been deleted. I again went in, changed my password again and reinstated my current information. I attempted to reinstate my security alerts, but received a message from Wells Fargo stating that wasnt possible. 

These charges are fraudulent. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX, CA ) {$250.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX, CA ) {$53.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX, CA ) {$120.00} Fraudulent information placed on my card profile included : ( XXXX ) XXXX ( a disconnected number ) Security alerts removed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I returned to The XXXX XXXX XXXX and was assisted by XXXX XXXX. After two hours of being transferred, put on hold, or told wed receive a call back, we were told NO. Wells Fargo was unwilling to close the account, refused to accept my verification, and stated I needed to go to a different bank. I again returned to the police station, and reached out to the XXXX and the AG and now have reached out to you. 

Friday XX/XX/XXXX, I received a new card in mail ( XXXX ), the card Wells Fargo earlier said didn't exist, earlier said it was a phishing scam, and earlier refused to cancel. The fraudulent charges are still present on my card. They have not yet been removed. All these charges were made in CA. 

I made my last payment today and Wells Fargo will receive this XX/XX/XXXX. What I owe Wells Fargo is {$0.00}. It was an electronic payment from my bank to theirs. The balance I owed was {$540.00}. I paid it in full. I have been desperately trying to get these fraudulent accounts shut down and those fraudulent transactions removed fully. Wells Fargo has denied this every step of the way. Because the hack included the email associated with the account and because Wells Fargo has willing allowed access to my account despite the 2 step verification and extra security measures I have taken, I will not release to them my new email. They only have my cell for which to contact me. I have communicated with Wells Fargo almost daily to no avail."
1211,"Wells Fargo sent me a flyer saying if I spent {$1000.00} within 3 months of account openning, WF will give me {$150.00} cash bonus which is redeemable in 2 billing cycles. I did spent more than {$2000.00} within 1 month, asking WF to post that cash bonus {$150.00} to my account. WF said NO, I have to wait until the 3 month period passed then 2 billing cycles in order to get the bonus."
1214,"Wells Fargo sent me an email back on XX/XX/XXXX stating that I had a bonus offer of {$150.00}. I called the XXXX number as to how to redeem this {$150.00} Bonus Offer and was advised that it could be redeemed on XX/XX/XXXX by going into the branch. 

However, I just called today, XX/XX/XXXX, and was advised that I did not make the guideline because I only spent {$470.00} in the first three months. I spoke with a manager also today. I told him to pull the tapes of the phone conversations as to the Wells Fargo employees verifying that I was entitled to {$150.00} bonus on XX/XX/XXXX. I actually spent {$1500.00} in the first three months of receiving the credit card. What a rip off. If I was not entitled back in XX/XX/XXXX, why not state it at that time? Today, XX/XX/XXXX, also,  one phone rep stated that the bonus will go directly into my account within 7 days. That is when I requested to speak to a manager."
1215,After reviewing the account statements I discovered that credit that was applied on XX/XX/2018 for XXXX was reapplied XX/XX/2018 as a charge or a balance transfer. This amount was the charges for the card I had not received and the charges that were not recognized when I had gone to the branch and spoke to the teller that in fact treated me in a very poor manner. There was also a late fee that was charged in XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX and I do not understand how that was done as I have no late payments and Wells Fargo is the only account that has reported this error. So the amount that was in dispute was just reapplied as a balance transfer?? That seems to be unfair and as time has gone by there has been no letter to state the charges were going to be reapplied. Then there was several ( BANK REVERSE CREDITS ) that were not clear as to the reason for the adjustment. I would like to have this issue looked over because I think that doing business with Wells Fargo has become a real problem and that I believe that the balance for the account is far less than THEY have indicated.

1218,Wells Fargo has closed my secured credit card sometimes in XXXX of XXXX. I have found out about it in XXXX XXXX. I was told I should be getting my security deposit back to my checking account soon. In XXXX I still have not been given back my security deposit of {$600.00}. I n XXXX called again and got answer that they sent refund check to the address I do not live no longer. they were supposed to return money o my checking account two months ago. I was told I can go to any branch and request refund there. ( not  true ). I want to the branch and I was told I have to wait till and of XXXX to make stop payment to reissue new check. By that time different source told me that I have cashed the check what was not true ( someone else took it and cashed ). I sent the fraud form the bank branch and they claim that there is no form on file to process it. next time I was told there is a case but not assigned to anyone. case number was never given to me at no time. it ahs been 6 months and I have not gotten my money back
1221,On XX/XX/19 I sent an email to XXXX demanding that my Wells Fargo Propel American Express credit card be closed at my request and that any further communications with me be in writing. They have arrogantly refused to do so. I believe their actions represent a general pattern with other account holders. They emailed me an acknowledgment on XX/XX/19. They emailed me a demand on XX/XX/19 that I download an XXXX application called XXXX in order to communicate. I attempted to do so. The app is not functional with my XXXX XXXX. I so notified them on XX/XX/19. I then received a Wells Fargo letter demanding that I either communicate with them by phone ( see my previous in writing only instructions to them ) or mail them a NOTARIZED demand to close the account. To date they have illegally failed to promptly close the account based upon my original demand. I can provide copies of all emails and their letter. Please contact and sanction them and require that they follow the law. Thank you.
1222,"This complain is about Wells Fargo Bank. when I pay my Wells Fargo visa credit card online, from my Wells Fargo checking account, the payment amount is taken immediately from my Wells Fargo checking account but not posted to my Visa credit card Account for a period of 3 days. I can not benefit or use the amount that I just paid on the card for 3 days. It will show online as payment in process. But when the funds of that payment are finally available, it will show online that the money was credited the day you made the payment 3 days before when in fact was not. I have used this same Wells fargo checking account to pay other lenders credit cards, and these others credit cards post with in 1 day or 2 of the payment, and that is the moment my money is deducted from my Wells Fargo checking account. I did complain with the credit card representatives by phone, and they said this is how it is. I end up paying off my balance on this Wells Fargo credit card and close that account. My complain is that wells fargo is playing with the money of their customers for at least 3 days, and this is not a fair business practice."
1224,"I recently received mail from Wells Fargo stating that I owe a balance of {$2000.00} and my amount past due is {$530.00}. I want to dispute this claim because Ive been out of state for over a year and I also have a letter from a former employer stating that my personal information has been compromised, I also dont live at that address that they have on file as well so I want to dispute the fees that they are stating in the letter that I received. I havent use my card in almost a year. As I mentioned, my personal information was compromise, and I believe somebody has been using my credit cards, which is fraudulent activity."
1226,"In XX/XX/2021, I was notified that I had a personal credit card bill from Wells Fargo. I never opened up a credit card with Wells Fargo, only have had a checking and savings account opened. I called them immediately to find out if this was a mistake. The agent made me aware that a personal credit card had been opened in my name online. When the agent made me aware of the purchases that was made, I realized that my former boss, XXXX XXXX XXXX, had opened up this account in my name. I made the agent aware of what had happened, and asked them if they would need a police report to go with the claim. The agent stated I did not, that I would make my statement and that would be it. In XXXX, I received a letter in the mail from Wells Fargo stating that the claim was denied and sent a letter for mediation. I completed the mediation paper and sent it back via mail. I also called the fraud department and made them aware that document was forthcoming in the mail. The agent stated that once the form was received, I would receive a phone call and a letter in the mail. Months went by and I didn't not receive any phone call or mail. The only documents I received in the mail was a credit card bill with late fees. I called and left a voicemail with the fraud department in XXXX, and still had not received a call back. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with several agents. I first spoke with the fraud department. The agent made me aware that the claim was denied again in XXXX. I was never notified. The agent then made me aware that my credit card account, which has been closed since XX/XX/2021, was preparing to be charged off at the end of XXXX. I stated that the claim needed to be reopened since this was considered identity theft. The agent then stated that a police report would help. This made me confused since this was not directed of me in the beginning when I asked. Then, the agent transferred me to collections. The agent in collections directed me that I make a payment on the account to prevent the credit card account from being charged off. However, this was baffling to me since I never received notification that the account was going to be charged off, and also why would I need to make a payment if the account is under review? I also asked for a claim number. The agent stated that "" with these disputes there aren't any claim numbers, just give the card number. '' I do not know the card number due to not ever having the credit card! Therefore, I do not have a claim number. I also tried to have my fiance listed as someone who is authorized to discuss this claim, since I work two weeks out of the month out of town and I am unable to be reached. They stated I would have to list her as an authorized user on the card, which is baffling since the account is closed and again, why would I list her as an authorized user on account that I never knew existed? This has been very stressful trying to receive a solution for this. Each time the claim was denied, I never received a reason why. They stated payments were made on the account. However, my former boss had access to my social security number and account information. The amount owed for this credit card is {$6100.00}, which includes months of late fees that accumulated throughout the investigations. I am asking that I am not held liable for this credit card and the credit card be removed from my credit report. I have filed a police report and the XXXX XXXX Police Department is handling an ongoing investigation since there is history of this guy committing fraud. The Police Report number is XXXX."
1227,"I have wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX card ending in XXXX. 
It has cell phone loss and repair protection plans. I am using this card to make payments for my monthly wireless bills. During XX/XX/2019 - I lost my XXXX XXXX phone. 
I reported this incident to this credit card company - some loss prevention program etc ... 
Till now i haven't got money for the cell phone that i lost even after doing all the paper work."
1228,"In XXXX of XXXX I attempted to buy my husband a XXXX via XXXX for his birthday. I tried twice to make purchases via XXXX, but I was refunded via XXXX and XXXX as the listings were scams. However, in the process of one transaction, I unfortunately fell for sending money to an individual via XXXX XXXX to secure the item. I believe during this process this person somehow got my information, or infected my phone and this started the chain of events that lead to them fraudulently using my Wells-Fargo credit card and sending money from my Wells-Fargo checking account. 

I had believed my Wells Fargo accounts were actually closed on XX/XX/XXXX, up until XX/XX/XXXX when I checked my credit score and noticed a bad mark posted to my report from Wells Fargo. It turns out from XX/XX/XXXX individuals took cash advances and made fraudulent payments to my credit account. They also transferred monies to my checking account and used cash apps to take money out of the checking. 

I have tried to resolve this issue with Wells Fargo repeatedly to no avail. I have sent multiple letters and called multiple times. It is very frustrating that no one person can be contacted over the phone to sort out the details of the case. The purchases, deposits, and activity on the card throughout this period match no prior activity or behavior patterns since the inception of the account. I maintained an 800+ credit score prior to this incident and have routinely contributed to my savings and retirement accounts. My behavior doesnt match someone who made these charges, or even knew of them. Wells Fargo has denied my claim for two reasons from what I can tell. The first is that Ive made payments on the card, which I have not, and that the transaction came from an authorized user, or gateway. I am the only authorized user of my account and I did not make these purchases. 

I sent a letter disputing this again XX/XX/XXXX to Wells Fargo. I have not heard back from them, so on XX/XX/XXXX I filed a police report with the XXXX Economic Crimes Unit and I am filing a complaint with the Consumer FInancial Protection Bureau. I hope these actions can help cause this issue to come to a proper closure."
1232,There was a late payment that showed up incorrectly for my wells fargo credit card in XX/XX/2015. I paid the balance always on time and never any payment from either my wells fargo or other credit card ( I have 10+ credit card ) I made several calls and the bank disagreed to fix the issue. Why should I delay a payment on the a XXXX credit limit card while I always pay on time for my credit card with 30K+ limit
1233,Yes I have over XXXX total cash in my savings with Wells Fargo they mislead me and had me open a secure credit card over a year ago with XXXX down to secure the card. They are scamming people as they sent me a XXXX dollar unsecured card but refused to i grade my XXXX dollar card knowing they are over 220 thousand dollars just in my savings I am a XXXX XXXX and I wont be be discriminated against or cheated with their secure credit card program which I meet beyond the guidelines to insecure it as I made over 30 payments and always keep a XXXX monthly balance
1234,The previous I was a complaint credit card/debit isn't resolved my disputed. The banks only proved what they are credit back from XX/XX/2013 to XX/XX/2013 not credit back from XX/XX/2013 to XX/XX/2013 & before XX/XX/2013. I can not access to my business account to provide my business missing credit back.
1235,"I have disputed with the three credit bureau 's many times and had zero luck getting anything updated or accomplished. I have spoken many times to Wells Fargo associates in executive office as well. I applied for a mortgage earlier this year and was turned down because of a Wells Fargo Credit card charge off that is reporting on my credit report. I do not think this debt is accurate or mine. I had to settle for half of the debt in order to move forward with a mortgage. Wells Fargo collection department said it would update to paid in full. It is still reporting inaccurately on my report. The charge off date is incorrect because I paid the card in full in mid XXXX. The credit limit was {$1900.00} dollars. The balance was at around {$900.00} that was paid in full in XXXX. The highest amount reporting {$2100.00} dollars, of which I have paid {$1000.00} to settle a bogus debt. Now I also had a checking account with these folks which was my only account that I used to make payments to this credit card account. Every time I have tried to get credit card statements ( I have never received a statement since early XXXX ) I am denied and routed to the "" collections '' department. I have also tried on the checking account side of things to gather statements from the old checking account with no luck. I know there was no payments authorized for this card since I paid the account in full in XXXX. One representative said that payments continued to be applied to credit card from "" savings '' account all the way into late XXXX. The worst part is I didn't even have a savings account with Wells Fargo or any debt against this credit card for that matter. This has cost me major time, money, and stress. I had to settle for a higher mortgage rate, I have hired agencies to clear this up, and I have spent my own man power to try and tackle this issue. Please help a consumer out against these corporate scammers."
1238,My social security check not accepted sent back by bank.Could not make payments for credit card on line could not pay at Bank either. Debit cards being canceled by bank repeatedly them ordering new ones. Think there were fraud charges on account without notifying me first or even talking to me.interest rate changing on card.

The expedited shipping was 7 days guaranteed. I received six of the seven shoes a total of 8 business days after the date of purchase. The tracking number was XXXX XXXX the delivery was not received until the XXXX. Six of the seven pairs of shoes were delivered. Of the six shoes that were delivered all of them had irreversible damage due to the shoes and the shoe boxes being in a shipping container that was 14 inches by 6 inches by 8 inches ; the shoes were jammed into the box. The shoes had deep scratches in the material, were bent and concave and pieces fell off during shipment. I contacted the seller XXXX multiple times from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX.

I then turned to Wells Fargo, my bank which I purchased the items on via a Visa credit transaction ( note, the items were not purchased on credit ). This was in mid XXXX. When filing the claim for reimbursement the bank offered no options other than text. There was no effort to collect pictures or documents from me. In late XXXX Wells Fargo responded that they will not reimburse me for the charge because the charge was authorized by me and there was no evidence that I did not intentionally make the purchase ( which is not what I filed the claim for ). I then tried to go to the XXXX in late XXXX.

I also called Wells Fargo 's claim department number noted in their response. The person I spoke to said my claim was still open and has never been assigned to an individual and asked me to call back in 48 hours. This is unacceptable. By law Wells Fargo is liable for these credit charges and should therefor reimburse me for the damaged goods and unfulfilled service which totals {$460.00}.

1248,"A credit card account with Wells Fargo bank was fraudulently opened by ex-husband with Wells Fargo Bank. It did not come to my attention until years following our divorce. I made repeated efforts to have me removed from and close the account. 

In XX/XX/2017, I received an {$85.00} dollar payment from Wells Fargo for damages with reference too the unauthorized account and the accounts were removed from the credit reporting agencies. 

This week I received a letter from Wells Fargo regarding an early warning system for unauthorized accounts. In conversation regarding these accounts, it was brought to my attention that the disputed account was still opened. Further I was told, that I was still considered an active signer on the active and liable for all funds charged to the account."
1249,"This originally started in XXXX with card number ending in XXXX. There was a fraudulent charge on my card. As you can see in exhibit 1, I asked Wells Fargo to close the account. In order to get them to review this fraudulent charge, it took letters, many, many phone calls. I repeatedly asked them to close this account only to find out it was not closed. I am asking when the account ending in XXXX was actually closed. Now years later XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX, I get a new fraud alert. The fraud alert that I just received is on 2 different account, one ending XXXX & XXXX. I NEVER opened these accounts, NOR DID I EVER REQUEST a new charge card with Wells Fargo. I want to make sure that Wells Fargo has NO open accounts at all for myself. 
i now have to go through the whole process again of faxes, letters and calls stating I did not use these two cards when I had no idea these accounts were even opened in the first place. How is it possible that Wells Fargo opens charge cards without a customer permission? I would like the call I made to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX reviewed. In the call, I was advised that there was a note on my account to leave the card open, but send no notices in the mail. Why? If you review all of my phone records you will see that I called many times asking for my card to be closed and NEVER did I request a new card be opened. 
I have several questions- When was the acct ending in XXXX closed? How did 2 more accounts get opened, ending in XXXX & XXXX? What will it take to get Wells Fargo to close all accounts opened in my name and make sure another account is not opened without my permission? I want all the activity on these accounts paid by Wells Fargo since I did not open the accounts. Please help. This is causing extreme XXXX  and XXXX, I do not want the credit I worked so hard to achieve gone over accounts I never opened. Please contact me with any questions at XXXX XXXX"

1253,on XX/XX/18 i contacted wells fargos regarding a credit line increase on one of my cards i have with the limit was set at {$600.00} already. i asked for an increase of {$10000.00}. this card i had for 3 years on the account no missed payments aways on time. instead i got an increase of {$200.00} dollars.i dont nothing on my credit report that would not grant my request
1255,"I filed a credit card dispute with Wells Fargo VISA for {$1800.00} on XX/XX/16 for a dining table that I purchased from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The table was defective and not what was promised to me by XXXX designer. The merchant returned the table but was charging me a 30 % restocking fee, which by law is wrong. I received notification from Wells Fargo that the dispute investigation was completed on XX/XX/16 and my claim was declined stating, We are unable to obtain a refund on your behalf because your dispute falls within the merchants pricing and policies, which we have no authority to change. I not only didnt get the 30 % restocking fee refunded, but Wells Fargo did not recover the money owed to me for the returned table. I question this outcome with many phone calls and many reinvestigations were done by Wells Fargo and they continued to responded Theres nothing more we can do. They stated I would have needed a 3rd party who works with furniture to verify the table was defective. So, I contacted Signature Designer Services the company that delivered and picked up/returned the table and obtained a letter from them verifying the table was defective. When I attempted to submit the verification letter to Wells Fargo, they stated I missed the deadline of XX/XX/16 and said the case was closed. Wells Fargo told me I would need to get the refund from the merchant on my own. I took the merchant to small claims court for my refund. At court, I was given papers from the merchant showing she had arbitrated with Wells Fargo, which I was unaware of. The merchant told the judge in court she won in arbitration and I recovered {$0.00} from the court. At home, I looked closer at the arbitration papers and noticed there was no arbitration ruling only pre-arbitration. I called the Dispute Resolution Department so I could get a copy of the arbitration ruling but was told there was no arbitration ruling. They stated Wells Fargo missed the deadline and failed to turn in the needed documents on my behalf, which resulted in the case being closed. The pre-arbitration information clearly states Wells Fargo failed to receive sufficient documents from the merchant to prove her side and they were proceeding with arbitration. This dispute was never arbitrated but closed because of Wells Fargos failure to submit the documents needed on my behalf. Wells Fargo lost arbitration because of their own mistake and then recharged my account the {$1800.00} I was refunded during the investigation. I should have been refunded the money from the dispute and should not have to pay for the banks failure to do their job properly. This is dishonest and unethical."

In my XXXX statement, I made a payment of XXXX and call well fargo to waive the late fee of XXXX they didn't, they refused to.

I made my payment but I just want to be credit for the late fee. 
I am not asking for suspense in my account or for forbearance. I just want the late fee to be a wave. I struggle but I pay my bills a day late and late fees should not be charged during this hard time.

1270,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, in our phone conversations you extended me the opportunityto proveto WFB CCS that the reasons WFB decreased my credit limit were false. By providing you proof with either a credit report or request a credit limit increasedwith your CCS team that involvespulling my credit report. In my conversation with the Manager, I specifically asked what your lookback period is ...? She responded, 12 months. I also asked fromwhat date? What date did you use onme? She replied XX/XX/XXXX, But I'm pretty sure it was XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Either way, you'll see, from the uploaded credit report with this complaint, that all collection accounts have a last reported date of XX/XX/XXXX which is outside the look back period ... in other words, not within your look back period of 12 months that is from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. ALSO! They are not opened. All collection accounts on my credit report are "" closed ; '' and reported closed the same date last reported with a "" zero '' balance too. 
You will also see duplicate accounts for the same collection accounts three months later dated XX/XX/XXXX showing the same original balances that are easily identify as duplicate reporting ... with same information that states closed with no balance owed. Again not any collection account is being reported within your look back period, showing opened or with a balance. Per your final letter on the matter, your reasons for decreasingmy credit line specially states : '' late payments or negative record in the last 12months. "" and "" recent late payment on credit report. "" Take a look at the credit report provided and you'll see the information you based your decision on is false. 
In addition, all opened accounts are in good standing ; and I know they have been since they opened. Credit report provided shows you a look back period on satisfactory accounts as far back as XXXX. Regardless, none of the open accounts report any late dates ever or lates within your look back period .They all state paid as agreed. 
Moreover, take note that the credit report does not state how many times any account has been paid to zero. Your letter specifically states, '' low paymentto balance on WF credit card "" ... only! Therefore, WFB CCS would knowhow many times I have paid it off to a zero balance and or paid down the balance. I have had my card since XXXX. I have most certainlypaid it off several times and paid down the balance many times in attempts to lower my debt. ************Furthermore, look at page17on my credit report, you'll see that the very next month XX/XX/XXXX I paid off the same Wells Fargo credit card account in question from $ XXXX a zero balance. *********************** So bringing the above to your attention, where are the late ( s ) payment ( s ) you supposedlysaid I had in the look back period ...? AND! How is it that I passed all other previous credit account reviews??? ... when I had open collections???"
1271,I never was late on payments. With no explanation WellsFargo closed my account

1273,Wells Fargo at the XXXX XXXX in XXXX sc opened a bogus account. XXXX XXXX was the banker. When the credit card and statement arrived there was no balance associated with it.

The banker stated that there was a promotion going on spend {$5000.00} in 3 months and get {$500.00} cash back and receive your cash back in 12 weeks. I fulfilled the offer within 3 months with over {$6000.00} spent. After not receiving my money as promised I made a call to the credit card department. The representative I spoke to stated to me that I would receive my money in 3 to 5 days. I did not receive it so I made another call the representative I spoke to said that the previous representative was misinformed and I would not receive my {$500.00} cash back from Wells Fargo for 45 to 60 days. I then made a call to the banker that opened this credit card for me and he made a call to the Wells Fargo credit card company and they stated to him that they would be paying me my {$500.00} cash back within 3 to 5 business days. Again, it did not happen. I then made another call to the banker and he stated he called the credit card company again and the person that he spoke to was misinformed and told him that I would not receive my money for at least 45 days. I need a call to corporate and made an official Complaint about this and never received a phone call back so I called back to corporate and they stated to me that I would not receive my money until XXXX of XXXX. I since then have contacted the local news and the Federal Reserve Department. My banker made a call to me and he stated to me that Wells Fargo said that he was not allowed to discuss this with me any further. Shortly after that conversation in executive from Wells Fargo contacted me and told me that they were working on it it was going to take some time. What time is there to take Wells Fargo offer and they did not fulfill their offer I am getting the runaround from Wells Fargo I'm thinking this is why they have a bad name in this banking business. Just trying to get my money and they are not fulfilling this offer that I have in clear writing."

1280,"I made a reservation a car rental from XX/XX/2019 to XX/XX/2019 in Washington DC XXXX XXXX through the third part XXXX. [ My booking number is # XXXX ] I did NOT make a reservation directly from XXXX car rental. 

My price for this rental was XXXX {$210.00}. My Wells Fargo debit/credit card was only charged {$210.00} and the difference was charged at the XXXX XXXX desk with my different credit card when I got a car in XX/XX/2019. 

Initially, I have made a reservation on XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX. XXXX did not take my Wells Fargo debit/credit card when I was in XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX XXXX. The reason was they take only the major credit card. [ I was not very happy with their customer service. ] I went back to home and got a rental car the next day in XX/XX/2019 early morning around XXXX. 

Smelling inside of the car was not horribly bad when I just got in the car. But, I asked them to have another car, but I was told that another car is the upgraded car / different price so I could not get another car. 
Bad smell from the car was very unpleasant to deal with when I was driving and especially when the air conditioner was turn on. I was going to exchange to another car if I see other locations XXXX rental car on the way driving ; however, I could not find any other locations. Eventually, I had to stop by the store to get an air fresh for the car. 

I called the website in XX/XX/2019, where I have booked a reservation for the car and complained about it. I asked them to have credit the money back to my account for unsatisfied service. They told me that I needed to call XXXX directly about the issue. 

I called XXXX in XX/XX/2019 but I was told the same thing that I needed to call the website where I have booked it. I called them but, they have rejected my complaint. 

I called XXXX and they have promised me to give free coupons instead of refunding the money. I was told it take 7 days to process to get a promo code to use but I have never received the promo code and have called them so many times. I was told the same things over and over again. 

I am disputing the charge was they ( XXXX ) have not promised why they told me to do so. 

Wells Fargo has sent a letter to provide more information about the issue and I need to respond by XX/XX/XXXX which I just got the letter from them in XX/XX/XXXX when I get home late night. I have not had a change to call because it was too late to call and they closed. 
I called them the next day, XX/XX/XXXX about my claim. I was told a provisional credit of {$210.00} would reverse. 
They have not even given enough time to me to provide my situation to resolve the issue. 
It was not fair to me and they do not consider their customer. 
For that reason, I would like to report a satisfaction service that provided to me."

They informed me that they had received a change of address and had then sent a new card to the new address, it is a boarded up row home in XXXX. I told them I have not moved and had not requested a new card. The card was closed and I received a new card. A few weeks later I received a letter from Wells Fargo they had reviewed the charges and determined they were mine. I called the company to dispute this, again, I was home in Pennsylvania when they initially contacted me, I was told I had to submit a rebuttal in writing. I immediately wrote a letter and sent it to the address they provided. A few weeks later I received a bill with late charges. I again called to ask about the status of my rebuttal. They claimed they never received my letter and I needed to submit a new one via fax. I printed my letter and took it to the Wells Fargo office in XXXX, PA.

I continued to explain that my card had been compromised and I need to speak to someone about canceling this account and protecting my credit. I spoke with XXXX who said he could take care of me and was sorry for the other persons attitude. He wanted to know if I had my card with me and I told him yes it was in my safe with me it is not lost, my card was an XXXX XXXX XXXX card.

All of these payments were more then what was due where is my money? I find out that not only did they change the card number they had also changed my entire account without even informing me. So all my payments were going to the air somewhere, and were not being credited to my account. I once again called the fraud dept on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX and they told me that the money was with them. I asked why it had not been credited to my account. They said they would get back to me. The last time I called was in XX/XX/XXXX then I was told that they had changed my account number and I was paying the wrong account ... .I informed them I had no idea they had changed my account number as well as the card number. they said my account would be readjusted. I continued to be charged late charges in XX/XX/XXXX, they waived {$130.00} in late fees but why was my payment {$190.00} when my payments were never late? They were never more then {$150.00}, I always paid more then what was due. This continued thru XX/XX/XXXX they kept giving me the run around in the meantime I still made my {$150.00} per month payments. In XXXX of XXXX I finally said XXXX it I paid the so called late fees and moved forward never getting the issue taken care of. Then of course they raised the interest rate on the card as if it were my fault, to charge me the victim more ... ... ... 

Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX received my bill from XXXX opened it to find that once again I have fraud on my account ... .Called and spoke to XXXX in the Fraud dept who informed my they would open a new claim. She would be sending me papers in the mail I told her I WANT THIS CARD CANCELED. XXXX has lost a card holder Was extremely upset that Wells Fargo did not do a good job at protecting the clients of XXXX. This is the second time this has happened, she asked if I had any other issues with my other cards and I informed her no I don't, they send text messages when my cards are used and they call when a transaction looks suspicious. I thought you had a flag on my account? she said there is a flag so I asked then why did this happen? she said it slipped through the cracks. Seriously. I'm afraid they will damage my credit more with their FRAUD I feel as though someone on the inside is doing this to us the consumers and we have to fight for years to correct something that's not our fault to begin with. We are the victims and we still get victimized by the crooked companies. This is stressful, and unfair to have to disrupt my life to have to do the work of Wells Fargo.

I've initiated an investigation with Law Enforcement, private investigative resources and seeking a resolution as soon as possible. The fraudulent balance reporting is in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, specifically Section 609 of the FCRA. The evidence accumulated so far of the fraud is beyond overwhelming. The transactions appear to be all over and to the extent that fraudsters used my credit card information/identity to travel and purchase flights. I have submitted all of this information to the relevant parties and still do not have a resolution nor correction of the accurate balance reporting. I have received conclusive confirmation that my name/identity/credit information has been compromised in recent data breaches and I'm pursuing legal recourse in light of these data breaches. Unfortunately in addition, I still am missing a black briefcase that had sensitive information from the me and my girlfriends including copies of our ID for a lease agreement application. Police is investigating for suspects and I've requested surveillance. Based on the CC statement provided to me from the branch locally there are charges all over and some appear to be almost simultaneous. I was under the impression that as an added protection and layer of security the WF Fraud department will block transactions that appear outside of the norm In looking at these charges, how were these not marked as fraud immediately? Some literally are what appear to be foreign passengers using my information to book flights? The CC statement displays this Intel. How much more conclusive can fraud get. Im currently gathering information being supplied to me from the resources that I've hired including IP addresses, locations and any potential information I can use. As an official statement I would be happy to testify and show the evidence that I was either at home or at work these charges appear to have taken place and I have multiple individuals, coworkers, colleagues and evidence and even work clients that can easily confirm this. Again, the evidence of the fraud is overwhelming. My ask is for the correct, fair and accurate balance be reported before the fraud took place. The last valid transaction was on XX/XX/2019 - # XXXX - {$77.00}."
1309,"Wells Fargo secured credit card account # XXXX I was always pay on time, then fraudulent activity appeared and I discuss that with Wells Fargo but it was ignored and never resolved."
1310,"XX/XX/19 - A charge for {$11.00} instead appeared as {$110.00} on my credit card statement. 
XX/XX/19 - I filed a dispute expecting a quick resolution especially after providing them the receipt showing the actual charged amount. They refused to correct it. 
XX/XX/19 - I contacted the vendor who immediately refunded the {$99.00} overcharge and sent me verification. Wells Fargo never posted the refund. 
XX/XX/19 - Extremely unpleasant conversation with supervisor XXXX who appears to think feels that Wells Fargo can not be held accountable. It was the worst customer service experience I've ever experienced with any bank. 
XX/XX/19 - I sent them the vendor 's verification and they instead added an ADDITIONAL {$99.00}. It has been months and this is still unresolved."
1312,"I filed a complaint against Wells Fargo because I was told on numerous occasions that when a payment is made on my credit card and I am currently under a promotion ( 0 % for 18 months ) that the minimum payment goes towards fees, interest and higher rate portion of account first. Makes sense. what they failed to mention is because I was due for {$110.00} minimum payment and I made a {$5000.00} payment that the difference would be applied to lower interest first. reason? they explained that I should have made minimum payment of {$140.00} first. Then cut another check for {$4800.00} and then the monies would have been distributed differently. they also informed me that the agent who took the payment on XXXX XXXX should have explained this. the section under terms and conditions for their credit card is below ( WELLS FARGO Generally, we will apply your minimum payment first to lower APR balances ( such as Purchases ) before balances with higher APRs ( such as Cash Advances ). Payments made in excess of the minimum payment will generally be applied to balances with higher APRs first before balances with lower ones. ) They failed to mention that payments made in excess means writing another check separate from minimum payment. Had I been made aware that I should have just made the minimum first this would have saved me a lot of unnecessary interest. I have expressed my concern with several people who have similar promotions and they were not aware that making an enormous payment that covers the minimum payment is not the same. They were not aware that 2 payments are necessary. This is outrageous and I am going to pursue this matter."
1313,"I HAD NOT REVIEWED MY STATEMENTS IN A FEW MONTHS, SO I DECIDED I WOULD GO THROUGH EACH CHARGE CAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE I WAS PAYING MORE THAN WHAT I HAD USED IT FOR! AFTER GOING THROUGH I FOUND A CHARGE ONXX/XX/17MADE BY XXXX XXXX  FOR XXXX ONCE I FOUND THIS I CONTACTED WELLS FARGO AT XXXX I SPOKE WITH A GIRL NAMED XXXX SHE TOOK MY FRAUD CLAIM AND SENT ME A NEW CARD THEN A FEW DAYS LATER I GOT A LETTER CLAIMING BECAUSE I KEPT MAKING PAYMENTS THAT I VALIDATED THE TRANSACTION!

I DID NOT MAKE THIS CHARGE AND I DESERVE MY MONEY BACK."
1316,"WELLSFARGO IS ACCUSING ME OF FILING A FALSE COMPLAINT ON MY CREDIT CARD, SAYING THAT I DID THE FRAUDULENT CHARGES ON MY CARD.

1318,"CFPB Complaint - XX/XX/2020, I bought floor planks from XXXX XXXX XXXX - the Merchant. 
- The shipment was thoroughly inspected and was pristine, with no damages. 
- The planks arrived in a package of 10. 
- Upon opening the packages, in order to install the floor, we discovered a good number of them ( the planks ) to have manufacturing damages ( see pictures attached ). 
- After not being able to reach an amicable resolution with the Merchant, I file a credit card dispute for half of the purchase amount with my CC company - XXXX through WellsFargo, NA. 
- The dispute was filed on or about XX/XX/2020, and followed up the pasted below this line email : ___________________ Facts : - Upon arriving of the shipment, from XXXX  XXXX  XXXX, I thoroughly inspected the pallet/freight and all the boxes for any damages. The shipment was perfectly intact and the driver was very courteous and delivered the pallet to my front courtyard. See picture. 
- I stored all the boxes inside the home immediately and kept them for 3 or more days prior to beginning installation. See picture. 
- On the very top of the shipment, some planks were damaged from over tensioned metal strapping. See picture. We did not use those planks as the merchant would probably allege. 
- Many of the planks were perfect which lead to easy and satisfactory installation. 
- Unfortunately, a big part of the shipment was subpar quality : the underlayment was not positioned property and overlapped some of the grooves which made the installation very difficult and/or impossible ; further, the underlayment was cut with a utility knife in MANY places ; many of the groves ( locking channels ) were impossible to lock. See picture. No retailer would ever sell such a bad quality product in any retail establishment as no customer would ever buy it. 
- On the XX/XX/2020, I called the merchant but the voicemail was full, I followed up the next day with the same effect. Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I was able to speak to the merchant and followed up with an email, with pictures attached. 
- Few more phone calls, text, and emails were exchanged with the merchant, however, although the merchant offers a lifetime warranty, they did not accept any responsibility for the damage on arrival product. The merchant proceeded to blame the concrete slub, the freight company, the installer, etc. They even suggested that the underlayment is not perfect because some customers chose to remove it and it is cut through because it needs to come from somewhere ( a bigger piece ). 
-The concrete slab was perfectly cleaned, even sanded prior installation ; it is a brand new home with a post-tension slab. See picture. 
- It is impossible to damage the product because the pictures CLEARLY SHOW that it is a manufacturer 's defect/flow. 
- I even suggested establishing a video conference so the owner of XXXX  XXXX XXXX can clearly ( with nowadays technology, in some cases as good as being there in person ) see the damages and evaluate the situation but my request was denied. 
- I suggested that I will hire a license AZ inspector to evaluate the floor but the Merchant alleged that i have to pay {$250.00} for them to do an inspection.

- A picture is worth a thousand words. You don't inspect a shattered glass, right.

___________________ Continuing with FCPB Complaint ... 
My CC dispute was denied for none pertinent and none factual reasons. Such as : - The floor planks were damaged during the shipment ; - The client waived all his rights to warranty because he accepted the shipment and did not file a report. 
Baffled and dumbfounded by the inability of the XXXX to decipher fact from allegations I filed prompt remediation, attached below this line : ____________________________ After waiting close to 4 months I received a letter that my dispute was denied based on allegations from the Merchant and erroneous interpretation of the facts by the claim representative. 

- I have never alleged that the floor planks were damaged during transport, just the opposite, the crate and all individual packages arrived perfect and were thoroughly inspected. 
- During the 3-4 months of waiting resolution, I called no less than 4 times and received one phone call from the claim representative, assigned to the claim, about a week prior to denying the claim. 
- During the said phone call I was asked to provide an independent opinion of the alleged damages. PLEASE FIND IT ATTACHED HEREIN. 
- The Merchant claimed that I have alleged that the floor was damaged during shipment, which is contrary to what I told them. 
- The Merchant claims that I have refused a floor inspection although I was the one that proposed an inspection from an independent party.

- The Merchant claimed that we have broken the floor locking mechanism during installation ; however, this claim is not only egregious but unfounded and unsupported by any evidence. There is not a single picture that would support such a claim. 
- The Merchants letter is signed by XXXX XXXX. XXXX has never spoken to XXXX although he requested on few occasions to speak to him and even offered to establish a video conference so he can personally see the flooring product and the installation. Those requests were not granted. 
- The Merchant claims that XXXX agreed to the XXXX XXXX XXXX terms and conditionsprinted on the bottom of the invoicebut failed to attach any stipulated agreement ( such as an email or text ), as such does not exist. The invoice is issued upon payment received and does not construe an agreement and is unconscionable. Assuming arguendo, that such agreement existed, would have been irrelevant as none of the product was damaged during shipment and handling. 

Continuing with CFPB Complaint ... 
XX/XX/2020, I received a letter from Well Fargo reaffirming the denial of my dispute, based on the same unfounded in any facts or logic reasoning."
1320,"On two separate occasions I used my Visa Debit card issued thru Wells Fargo to pay for a stay at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had to prepay for the trip and I completed payment in XXXX of 2019. I went on the trip in XXXX of 2019 and the services was misrepresented nor did it complete services as describe and as I paid for. I called to place a dispute however Visa declined my dispute staying that with Debit card purchases since I stayed there and it was a debit card I used there was no dispute rights. However I have video, emails, pictures and all information requesting to have accommodations and corrections made. The vendor did not respond or correct any issues. Also accordingly with the dispute the merchant even though it was a debit card used my card as a credit card and thus it was ran thru the credit card processing system as use a credit card not requiring a PIN for the purchase therefore I an supposed to be given the same dispute rights and protection as if it was a credit card. Visa non has Wells Fargo do that."
1321,"I have a zero interest if paid within one year credit card that was issued by Wells Fargo for an XXXX central air unit. I have automatic payments. I want to change the payment to increase it, but the Wells Fargo website says i can't change it online, but I have to call customer service. I called customer service and they told me they can't change the payment, they can only cancel the current payment and add a new one,  which will take 30 days to become effective. That means it would miss my next due date ( or as its 30 days, any consumers due date ), and I might be late on my payment, triggering all of the interest they forego when I pay my balance in full within one year. 
Very crooked customer service from Wells Fargo, the issuer."
1322,"Ridiculous that in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic Wells Fargo limits the number of online transactions/payments that you can make on the Wells Fargo website. I tried to make a payment to my Wells Fargo credit card account and got an error message stating that I've "" exceeded the number of online payments for the month. '' I subsequently called to attempt to make a phone payment and was disconnected. I will go into the branch to make the payment which I would prefer not to do because coronavirus cases are surging in my geographic area. 

It should be noted that my payment is not late. I am trying to make an extra payment so that I can pay off the balance in full within the next few months. 

Wells Fargo is the only credit card company that I'm aware of that limits the number of online payments."
1323,"On XX/XX/2020 I was "" accidentally '' informed by Visa XXXX Supervisor ( id # XXXX ) and WellsFargo bank rep, that Visa has a Merchant product ( Visa Account Updater ) when I questioned a charge on my account that should not have been processed because the Merchant did not have my new credit card number. 
The Merchants financial institution ( bank ) has the ability to gain access to card holders new card information without Visa notifying, verify, confirming or getting authorization from the card holder ( consumer ) that new card information can be provided to the Merchant. 
Not only does this violate the card holders privacy rights and leave them susceptible to fraudulent activity ( loss of funds ) in the consumers bank account, identity theft and possible assault due to Visa blatant neglect to involve & /or notify the consumer in this process. If the government ( IRS ) is required to notify persons of any withdrawals, whether forced or agreed, Visa and financial entities  should not be allowed to violate a consumers protection by creating a Merchant tool & using it without consumer knowledge provided. Credit card companies and financial institutions to be required to make this merchant tool & process information clearly identified upon inquiring/set up of reoccurring or credit card payments instead of purposefully being vague in a disclaimer and or privacy statement regarding the sharing of consumer information. 
By not clearly informing the consumer it takes away the right to choose payment options ( check, credit card phone ) that may better protect their identity and account fraud activity. Also Wells Fargo, Visa, nor the Merchant that request this information, have this tool and the process the financial institution perform on their site as consumer information/awareness and it is not on privacy policy statements regarding how this information is shared. This tool/product clearly contradicts a portion of Visa privacy information which in turn violated my privacy rights and the ability to protect and sharing my information without my consent.

I feel extremely violated and disregarding as a consumer.

Visa- For security reasons and to prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal information, cardholders should contact their payment card issuers to access their Card Transaction Data. This helps ensure that access to the information is only provided to the authorized individuals, subject to the issuers verification processes"

1325,"in XXXX of 2019 had identity stolen along with my car. told on recorded lines that i didn't authorize, also in writing asked for a finra complaint to be formally submitted. Wells fargo sent me letters claiming they researched it and found I did authorize. Finally forcing me to obtain police records etc. even after they were informed. they opened this account on line with no verification, they were not helpful. i work in this industry and my credit report is one item clients use when looking for a financial advisor. they were not helpful, and acted in an extremely unprofessional manner, given that they opened the account on line with no verification"
1328,"On XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  placed a hold on my Wells Fargo Credit card for {$280.00}. On XXXX the above mentioned credit card was charged {$84.00}, but the {$200.00} hold that was placed was never credited back to the credit card. 
I checked the account balance on the credit card daily. On XXXX I called XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX to inquire about the missing {$200.00} credit. XXXX told me they had sent notice on XXXX to Wells Fargo to charge the credit card {$84.00} and to release the {$200.00} deposit. 
I then called Wells Fargo to inquire about the release of the {$200.00}. They told me that since no money transferred ( the {$280.00} hold ) that there would be no entry on my statement. However the balance didn't show any credit what-so-ever. So, I in turn am out {$200.00} because the hold was not entered and I am being charge interest on money I do not have. 
This is just plain wrong. If a hold was placed on my credit card that should be reflected in my credit card statement as I could not access those funds. 
I would appreciate your help with my problem. Should you need any more information please let me know. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
1335,"On or around XX/XX/2020 I submitted an online application for a XXXX XXXX  credit card underwritten by Wells Fargo Bank. Part of the process they require authentication of ID by a third party application. This application seldom works correctly. Finally, after many attempts, it did work. 

I filled out the application completely and accurately and submitted it online. After about a minute of "" processing '', I was given a telephone number to call. I called and the Wells Fargo employee stated that they can see the application and the full details, but yet they did not receive the application. There is nothing they can do, she stated. 

I used a different computer and again applied. Again, their third-party ID verification system didn't work correctly until the fourth attempt. Finally they were able to verify my ID and I complete and submitted my application. The same thing happened again. I was instructed to call. I called and the same story about how they see my application and see the data I filled out, but they didn't receive the application. 

She said my only alternative was to go to a XXXX XXXX store. 

I attempted to contact Wells Fargo via XXXX, but they seldom respond coherently. 

This is not the first time I have been involved with Wells Fargo XXXX incompetence. I believe they are simply refusing to accept applications for some illegal motive or they are simply incompetent to set up their application system and / or handle problems when they arise."
1342,"I, XXXX XXXX am submitting this complaint against Wells Fargo regarding a dispute with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. It all began with my experience at their false advertising that promised both a professional move and personnel. The movers from XXXX XXXX moving company lacked knowledge, were unprofessional, did not wrap my valuable items, damaged my belongings and showed general disregard to my satisfaction and lack of care. I witnessed the movers not assemble what was disassembled during the move and it was stated in the company website that items would in fact be assembled. I would like to state that my furniture was held random twice and I ultimately received my belongings days after than I expected. I was also served with two invoices and paid an initial deposit which was disputed and won. The delivery invoice with the extra charges were also disputed and won. There is a charge that has yet to be rectified for XXXX and I have made numerous unsuccessful attempt to do so. I am at the very end of the road with this issue and am requesting the help of the CFPB. I have made other attempts to speak directly with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and they refused to take my last phone calls. Please be advised that I have substantial documentation regarding my interactions with both Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that I will submit as an attachment to this complaint. After further investigation, I uncovered that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was not licensed in the State of Florida as a legitimate moving company. I have reached out to the Attorney General, the XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, myfloridalegal.com, XXXX and reports were filed with each entity. I have also reached out to individual attorneys ' for direction on this matter as well. The feedback I have received from the attorneys are that the company was not properly licensed for moving and a lawsuit would not be cost effective to deal with a fraudulent company. I would also like to state that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted false documentation to Wells Fargo Bank during the dispute. As a result of my dispute with Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I have experienced adverse effects of my credit report and find that borrowing has become extremely difficult. I would also like to add that this process has caused me extreme stress, aggravation and heartache. From my experience I believe that the personnel from Wells Fargo who handled my investigation were incompetent and each covered for each other. Each time that I received correspondence from them I received it from different individuals and I believe that each would not contradict one another. Wells Fargo dropped the ball by paying he merchant when more documents should have been submitted. The very first letters I received from Wells Fargo did not contain any substance and I was not aware of what the issues were. I was in shock from their response after submitting over 100 pages of supporting documentation including but not limited to pictures and videos. A picture says 1,000 words. I have a hard time understanding that I disputed all three transactions and only won two of the three, please be advised that this is all included in the same issue. This issue has already caused me to disburse sums of money and to pay any additional funds about this issue would be a crime. I have experience thousands of dollars in damages to my belongings as a result of the negligence of the alleged professional movers."
1346,"On XX/XX/XXXX I had my credit scored pulled to purchase a home for my wife and I. My score was extremely low because there was a charge off credit card from Wells Fargo. We never use that credit card and we always watch our bills to make sure payments are conducted on time. Apparently there was a purchase made on XX/XX/XXXX for a renewal from microsoft which we cancelled and they still charged, we never received a payment notification from wells fargo for the XXXX charge from XXXX. No phone call no e-mail, nothing. Now that we are trying to purchase a home it 's become impossible because of this one card and a charge we were never notified off."
1349,"An online cash advance was made on my credit card account without my knowledge or approval on a Wells Fargo account. I disputed the charge and the dispute was denied. The total amount of the cash advance was {$290.00}. Coincidentally, a brokerage account was opened in a fraudulent manner in the same amount as the cash advance. The brokerage account has subsequently been closed. The cash advance was made on XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX 2019. Wells Fargo is now attempting to bill me for the amount."
1350,"I used to bank with wachovia bank ; wells fargo bought them out in XXXX. My interest rate of 8 % fixed, wells fargo advised me that the terms will never change everything will just transfer over. As of XX/XX/XXXX I noticed my interest rate went up because I was paying more on my monthly payments. Then in XX/XX/XXXX my interest went up higher than normal and I decided to look into it. When I did the terms of my APR changed from fixed to variable. I contacted Wells Fargo and no one cant tell me why my rates changed and its been over a month."
1356,"this is a account that I never open or apply for.I file a ftc report, they still with no proof said it was mines, so i file a police report too and the credit bureaus and wells fargo/XXXX XXXX still wont remove it from my credit nor forgive the debt"
1358,This bank is allowing strangers to use my available balance. They are also overcharging me for XX/XX/2020. I will contact the police if they do not stop bothering my credit card and banking accounts. I had an available balance of {$53.00} yesterday. The bank is allowing someone to access my credit card. I do not have any friends or associates to steal money from my checking or savings account. I paid a large payment on XXXX of 2020 yet I am farther over my limit. Why is that? Someone would have to back track my balance and available credit the last couple of months. This is ridicilious. How did I have {$53.00} available yesterday and now its {$53.00}. A stranger is causing my balance to go over the limit. My payment keeps increasing.
1363,Wells Fargo will not permit me to make a payment on my credit card so that they can charge me interest on the unpaid amount.
1369,"I purchased a oven on XX/XX/XXXX with a Wells Fargo credit line. This was a no interest credit line if paid in full within 12 months. I did not receive a bill during the first week of XX/XX/XXXX so I went to their online billing site and submitted a payment of {$1000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I get paid once a month on the XX/XX/XXXX so that is when I pay all of my bills. I did not receive a bill for XX/XX/XXXX by the first so, once again I submitted a payment online for another {$1000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The same thing happened for the month of XX/XX/XXXX. I submitted a payment online for {$1000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. When I finally received my billing statement in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX there was a late fee of {$27.00} added. I telephoned the Wells Fargo customer service number and spoke with a young women whose name I did not catch ( English was a second language ) and was told that due to the billing cycle, I was being charged a late fee because I was paying too early. I said that I would not pay a late fee for paying too early and expected it to be removed. She had to discuss this with her supervisor and after, I was told that it would be removed this time but that I needed to adjust my payment date. Apparently this is another way for Wells Fargo to steal from their customers. Who ever heard of being charged a late fee for paying too early? I believe Wells Fargo needs to adjust their billing cycle. This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. I will be calling every month to have this fee removed ( extremely inconvenient ) and I will NEVER recommend Wells Fargo to anyone for anything and will certainly NEVER EVER use their services again."

Wells Fargo is calling that "" Friendly Fraud ''. That is Not Friendly Fraud. Friendly Fraud is when You charge your own card and then dispute it with the bank. The charge was made on XX/XX/2021. The Wells Fargo representative Refused to do anything about the issue. So if I can't resolve it this way, I'm going to scour XXXX, Texas for an attorney to sue. At No point did I authorize Anyone to charge me {$200.00} for internet. The internet account that I was charged for isn't even in my name. It's in my XXXX 's name. Wells Fargo also charged me {$35.00} for the fact that the {$200.00} charged overdrafted my account by {$160.00}."
1373,"The promo date ended in XX/XX/XXXX. We had monthly payments withheld from our checking account that coincided with the end promo date. Needless to say, we received a statement from them saying we needed to pay {$170.00} in interest. I spoke with a rep, who assured me it was taken care of, and we would not be billed again. They still billed us for the interest, and we paid that, confirmation # XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 
They still withheld a XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$410.00} and tacked on {$170.00} more interest.

In fact I was asleep when the incident happened. The charges where made from XXXX TO XXXX. I was at my home asleep. I called and alerted the credit card company immediately. The filed the dispute incorrectly. The failed to include all the fraudulent charges made on the card. I have been back and forth with them trying to resolve this issue.

Emailed customer service, no reply. Called customer service, was also locked out of my account and could not log in, escalated to two supervisors, the last of which refused to assist me. Said an "" escalation team '' would call me tomorrow. Told her I worked during the day but gave her my cell number. This has been an ongoing issue with Wells Fargo since at least last Thursday, and they should have been more receptive and immediate with solving my issue. I am still locked out of my account."
1387,"Have a Wells Fargo Card that I use to pay my cell phone bill in order to take advantage of the Cell phone protection program they advertise as a major benefit. My phone dies, I go to the apple store so they can trouble shoot and prepare a statement I need for the claim. They determine the phone is unrepairable since the issue is motherboard related/. The Card Benefits folks deny the claim claiming a manufactures defect. How could they possibly know that? They said the phone has to show physical damage to be eligible. The claims about this benefit, which is heavily marketed, and the reality are very misleading. When I asked for a review of the claim they sent me the the XXXX XXXX XXXX who I highly doubt many people will take the effort to file with. I believe the claims vs. the reality are misleading and the decisions are not based on objective fact. The fact that they do not have an escalation process outside a time consuming third party process means the company did not have good faith."
1388,"Around XX/XX/2019, I noticed fraudulent orders on my account amounting to $ 77+ in pizza. I called Wells Fargo and was informed they would investigate and order me a new card. The very next day 26+ unauthorized transactions appeared on my account. Alarmed, I informed Wells Fargo again about the egregious acts. They again informed me that they would take care of it. 

Now I can't make sense of what I owe and what was fraud. They use an accounting-esque system that uses debit and credits much like accountants. The adjustments they note don't even list the reasoning for it. This is absurd and until Wells Fargo returns my funds, I will be out {$340.00}. I live and reside in the XXXX/XXXX area. How charges in other states went unnoticed is just absurd. Everyone in compliance should be fired."
1391,I received a XXXX in XX/XX/2016for the account XXXX with Wells Fargo. The identifiable code listed states that collection will discontinue and the account cancelled from the creditor. I was contacted by Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX and informed that they would not sell the account and would cease all collection activity. I am in the process of purchasing a home and due to the balance listed on the account it is making my process extremely difficult.
1393,"This kind of account is placed as a charged off account, be sure to inform me precisely why there's a balance indicating on the document whetherit 's a charge off? The balance is in fact wrong, please make sure to reverseit to XXXX   or remove the item fully. Please also producedocumentation toverify all the charges and credits in this supposed account that caused to theextremely high credit figure you might have displayed on my account. My demand to present these records is a standard information demand in accordance with myrights honored within the fair credit billing act. If you fail to give these detailsper my civil rights petition, please make sure you quickly remove this specificwrong posting."
1395,"I signed up for 0 % for 12 months with XXXX XXXX with the account issued by Wells Fargo National Bank. On X/XX/17 I sent a balance transfer from my credit card to Wells Fargo and the balance transfer was rejected. I called my credit card and they told me the balance transfer was returned back to them as Wells said the account information did not match the owner. Since this occurred, Wells charged my account 900 roughly in interest. I want this rolled back and the overnight address provided so I can get this off the account."
1398,"I have written twice to Wells Fargo concerning their continuing to report negative information beyond the 5 year statute of limitation ... Additionally, I have requested documentation as proof that I was ever late on this account. They continue to stonewall me. 

The FTC issued a CASS opinion many years ago that reporting of derogatory information on a credit report is deemed to be a collection action. Since the balance of {$440.00} is no longer legally collectible, it is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting act to continue to show this item on my credit report. 

Please have them delete this item in its entirety as it is both inaccurate and unverifiable. 

Thank you."
1401,"I had a friend who made a payment towards my card with Wells Fargo. He later on pulled the payment back. I had used my card for utility bills which put my card over its limit. I had spoken to people in a local branch, over the phone and via email regarding setting up payments so I could pay it down. I even spoke to the fraud department. They had said I am unable to set up payment arrangements due to it being a secured card. I was not disputing the charges just trying to get it paid down. Wells Fargo closed my account saying there was no contact although I emailed weekly and had been making payments weekly- biweekly to get it down. After Wells Fargo closed my credit card they forced an automatic payment of {$850.00} from my checking account XXXX  times I closed all my accounts. This all happened in XX/XX/2018 and they have a {$1500.00} deposit that they have yet to release to me or put towards my card. I am still in contact with Wells Fargo also know as scam artists to the every day consumer and nothing has been corrected."
1404,"Our Wells Fargo Visa card was charged on a card number that had been closed. We closed this card because we began to question the integrity of our contractor. Visa authorized the charge on the card that we had closed.

We hired a contractor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX, GA ) to paint the exterior of our home. We paid a deposit of {$2100.00} ( on our WellsFargo credit card ) on XX/XX/2018. The contractor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX, GA ) did not finish two portions of the job.

Number one he debated that they provided this service, even though it is detailed in his proposal. Number two, the contractor admitted that this was never completed and he agreed that it would be taken off of the final balance.

1. Perform complete and extensive surface preparation including sanding of all peeling paint and re-glazing of all windows where glazing is loose and/or missing. ( Part of the Painting portion of {$3600.00} ) 2. WOOD REPLACEMENT = {$570.00} Replace ( 2 ) 2x10 on garage. Replace ( 2 ) 1x4 on front garage. Replace 27 feet of lx8 and drip cap on right side. Replace 1 sill nosing with PVC on front right lower window Replace 16 feet of fascia on right side On XX/XX/2018, the contractor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX, GA ) charged another {$2100.00}. The job was not finished and not signed off on. Plus, he charged us the full balance when items one and two were not compete. The total job was XXXX less the deposit of {$2100.00}, less {$570.00} ( wood replacement - which was not done ), the total should have been {$1400.00}, when the glazing was complete. So, complaint is two fold. First, the contractor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX, GA ) charged the card without authorization and without completing the project. Second, he overcharged the balance by {$700.00}."
1406,"Wells Fargo Case # XXXX My Wells Fargo Secured card graduated on XX/XX/19 to an Unsecured card and my deposit was returned to me. I contacted card services via telephone on XX/XX/19 to inquire about the process of a credit line increase. 
While speaking to the agent she advised that I will need to speak with the underwriting dept so they could pull a credit report. I asked if this was a "" soft pull '' or a hard inquiry as I do not wish to have any new inquiries at this time. She advised she did not know but I can ask of the underwriting agent for clarity. 
Now transferred to the underwriting agent and after introduction, she educated me that she will be pulling my report to finish the process. I again asked if this was a hard inquiry as I do not wish to have any at this time. She advised that receiving a credit line increase through these means will result in a Hard inquiry. 
I educated I refused to have my credit pulled and I do not want to proceed with the credit line increase/. She advised that she canceled the application and no changes have been made. 

At the end of the business day, I receive a credit monitoring alert from XXXX, I pay for their monitoring service monthly, the alert stated I received a hard inquiry from Wells Fargo card services ( see attached XXXX ). 
I HAVE LOST 7 POINTS ON MY SCORE DUE TO THIS MISTAKE.

I attempted to contact the next business day XX/XX/19 but the IVR ( phone system ) had an automated message that their systems were down and unable to review accounts.

This repeated on my XX/XX/19 call as well. 

I made a follow-up call on 2/10/19and spoke with an agent named XXXX. I explained the issue and he submitted my complaint and a request for another credit dept to remove the hard inquiry. Our conversation concluded and I requested to speak with a Manager, Luckily I spoke with XXXX. 
XXXX was courteous and expressed empathy toward my issue. She vowed to have the calls reviewed and submit feeda=back to the corresponding agents, she continued to explain that my issue will be escalated to the XXXXxecutive Team for further assistance. 
XXXX provided their contact number and advised if I wanted to call in myself it will have to be at least next business day. 

After no contact on XX/XX/19, I call the executive number I was provided on XX/XX/19. 
I spoke with XXXX and then was transferred to XXXX who is not my case manager but was her partner and would be able to answer questions. 
XXXX explained that my case was being handled by XXXX but she can see that the credit dispute dept was notified and will be assisting getting the hard inquiry removed. 
XXXX advised that XXXX will be calling me in the next 1-2 days as she continues to work this issue. 

I reached out on XX/XX/19 to complain that I had not yet received contact from my case manager, I was assured by the rep that XXXX would call me asap. 
Now after a week of my case being received, I finally get a call for my case manager XXXX. She apologized profusely for the lack a timely call be claimed she did have "" some updates ''. She has at this time sent emails for feedback to the agent 's sups of whom provided the initial lack of info and subsequent improper accessing of my credit report. She also sent email requesting the recorded calls of my initial call and the underwriting. She explained that I would receive a call soon once she had received those calls and review them to continue my dispute within the credit dispute parameters. 

received a call on XX/XX/19 and they were still awaiting the call from the underwriting to review. XXXX advised she will send followup emails and contact me back with a resolution. 

Received a call on XX/XX/2019. status hasn't changed and still awaiting the call to review. 
I advised that this incompetent and unacceptable that it takes 6-8 to review a call and finalize a resolution. 
I asked to speak with a supervisor and seek escalated assistance. I was denied the supervisor claim "" they were are on another call but will contact you in 24-48 hours. "".

I didn't receive a call from anyone in Wells Fargo Offices for XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/19, Nor have I received a call on XX/XX/19. 
the 7 points lost from my score have not been awarded back and it has been explaining by several agents that WF does not have an influence on how many points are removed and subsequently added back. 

Summary of Top Concerns : 1 ) Violation of Privacy by accessing credit report without consent 2 ) Removal of hard inquiry from credit report 3 ) Lack of response time from departments handling the resolution 4 ) Restitution"
1407,"Back in XX/XX/XXXX I settled an account with Wells Fargo. It was a closed account on XX/XX/XXXX. It was a student credit card that I settled the debt amount and it still shows as a closed account on my credit report and has been negatively impacting my credit report.

1413,"Ive been a Wells Fargo customer for 36 years. On XX/XX/XXXX I initiated a balance transfer in the amount of {$4000.00} dollars using Wells Fargos SUPERCHECK ( # XXXX ) which is a promotion that allows you to transfer balances at a promotional rate of 0 % APR for 15 months and a fee of 4 %. This promotional rate expires XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX I initiated a second balance transfer in the amount of {$3000.00} dollars using Wells Fargos SUPERCHECK ( # XXXX ) with a promotional rate of 0 % APR for 15 months and a fee of 4 %. This promotional rate expires XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Wells Fargo credit card customer service @ XXXX to pay off the first balance transfer in the amount of {$2400.00} prior to the rate expiration on XX/XX/XXXX and to avoid paying 28.24 % APR on that balance. The customer service rep. told me that she could not guarantee the monies would be applied to the first balance transfer. I ask her why not its the oldest balance and dont the payments each month get applied to the oldest debt first. She said no, the payments go towards debt with an APR first and then it is allocated to the other balances, but she can not tell me how it would be allocated. I told her that sound unethical and wrong to me and she asked if I wanted to speak with her supervisor. She said her supervisor would tell me the same thing but maybe they can explain it a better way. I told her no that I would go to the branch near me a speak with a banker, we ended the call. 
I went to my local branch and spoke with the banker and he told me the way he understood it was the payment should go towards debt with an APR first and then the oldest transfer however, he would call the credit card team to make sure. He made the call and whomever he spoke with explained the same thing to him the rep. told me. He told me this person also said, if I wait until after the promotional rate expires on XX/XX/XXXX the system will automatically set a trigger to add the 28.24 % APR and if I paid the remaining balance owed on the first transfer around the XXXX or XXXX all the funds should go towards the oldest transfer because the system will see that an ARP will be applied. I told him paying 28.24 % APR is what Im trying to avoid and Im not going to wait until the XXXX to make a payment because the payment is due on the XXXX and Wells Fargo will charge me a late charge. I also told him it seems to me that all Wells Fargo is interested in is receiving that 28.24 % APR, thats how they make their money and they dont seem to care much about helping their most valuable commodity, the customer. 
After thinking about the information I received regarding this matter I couldnt believe how Wells Fargo is treating its customers. On XX/XX/XXXX I pulled out all my credit card statements to review how the payments were being allocated. I received a letter from Wells Fargo Consumer Credit Solutions the same day regarding another matter and it was signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX Senior Vice President Credit Card. I thought to myself maybe this person needs to hear my concerns, so I called the number on the letter which was the same one mentioned above. When the rep. answered the phone, I asked to speak with XXXX XXXX, she told that she could not transfer from her phone and she did not have extensions. She asks if she could help me, I told her I call on the XXXX and I would like for XXXX XXXX XXXX to hear my concerns. She told me her coworker would able to help me and is it ok to transfer the call, I told her yes. When the rep. picked-up the call he verified my information he asked how could he help me I told him I have a concern that Wells Fargo will not allow me to pay-off the balance on transfer that the 0 % rate will expires on XX/XX/XXXX, he said I see you paid the minimum payment and theres an overdraft advance and a purchase on this account. 
I said I just want to speak with XXXX XXXX regarding my concerns. He asks me to hold on, when he came back, he said he was going to transfer me to the customer service executive team I said fine. When the rep. picked-up the call she told me this call may be recorded and I said good please record the call. I explained my concerns as mentioned above and she said she needed to find out how I did the transfer and did anyone explain to me how it works. I told her I used the SUPERCHECK and I spoke with my banker at my branch. She went on to say when you signed the SUPERCHECK you agreed to the terms and conditions. She said she was looking at my account and the way it works is my payments will pay on the balance with the highest APR first and I have a purchase, overdraft advance, some interest charges and two balance transfers boy you have a lot going on. I said really, so I have a purchase for {$55.00} an interest charges of {$1.00}, overdraft advance {$8.00} an interest charges of {$0.00} all with an 28.24 % APR total {$65.00} and I made a payment of {$60.00} on XX/XX/XXXX so, if I pay {$5.00} more those charges will be paid and then can I pay-off the oldest transfer? She said thats not how is work and she began to tell me that when I initiated a second balance transfer I forfeited the grace period on the first balance transfer therefore, the largest percentage of my payments would go towards the transfer with the highest balance first because both have 0 % APR. I told her I felt this was unethical and wrong. I told her all the banks I do business with including the IRS apply your payments to the oldest debt first. She said we do not do things like other banks we do things different here at Wells Fargo and if I would have read the terms, I would have known how the program worked and she offered to send me a copy. I told no thank you I have a copy and what she was telling me was not what I read however, I would read them again. She said she had the terms in front of her she knows what they are because she must read them every day. I told her that looking at my statements I paid {$100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX which {$68.00} went towards the second balance transfer and {$0.00} went towards the first balance transfer and I dont know what happened to the remaining {$31.00}. She did not respond she just continued telling me ( maybe 6 or 8 times ) that I need to read the terms. I told her thats enough and she said Wells Fargo take these matters serious and she documented my concerns, and someone may be call me regarding this matter. I told her that I would be filing a formal complaint with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because I believe Im not the only one with this concern. She said all the other customers knows how it work because Wells Fargo disclosed the information, then she began to read the terms to me and what she was reading and what I have are two different things. 
Attached are copies of the Wells Fargos Interest and fee Information, Important information regarding this offer and two Interest Charge Calculation charts my statements."
1418,"Back in XXXX of XXXX I contacted Wells Fargo to see if I could lower my APR for my credit card. After being on the phone for over an hour I spoke with an Executive Leader to  negotiate a lower APR. At the end of the call, I was denied. I will ultimately have to close this credit card and open another one with a different bank if I can not renegotiate a better rate. In any case, my reason for writing this is due to the advice that I was given by an Executive Leader on the call. After I shared my excellent credit score rating ( monitored via FICO score by Wells Fargo ) and my history of paying on time since I opened up my credit card with Wells Fargo back in XXXX, I was advised to allow my credit card account to go delinquent due to failure of payment, let the Wells Fargo sell my account to a collections company and then negotiate paying 75 % -50 % of what is due. I was horrified and deeply offended that this was advice that a customer service representative was giving me. Especially since they have access to my credit score and my payment history with them and after clearly stating that paying on time and maintaining my high credit score were important to me. It was upsetting to hear this because most people in low-income households lack financial literacy. If this advice were given to them, they would have actually followed through with this terrible advice and had their credit score and history deeply affected by this. I called the next day after this happened to report this and was told that I would receive a call back to further discuss this matter. I also reached out to them in XXXX to discuss the same. I have not been given documentation of the original call or my complaints."
1428,"I applied and was approved for a Wells Fargo mastercard close to a month ago. Since Ive received the card, Ive been unable to access my account on Wells Fargo website. Ive tried following the steps to receive my username and password multiple times. It does work however the Wells Fargo website states system is temporarily unavailable. I have my username and password. Its been like this since Ive had my card. I have called the credit card help line and at no point in the phone menu does it direct me to the credit card help desk. My problem is not solved through the automated menu."
1430,I am trying to close my Wells Fargo account. I had a verbal agreement for a settlement at a branch via banker connection in XXXX. After initial payment was made there was no longer any contact through either party and Wells Fargo voided initial verbal contract due to undisclosed terms. I sat with a banker a couple months later and when we called they told me I would have to pay the original amount prior to agreement even though I had already made a payment.
1432,"On XX/XX/XXXX I transferred a {$11000.00} balance on to my credit card as part of a promotional 15 month 0 % APR balance transfer offer. On XX/XX/XXXX I transferred a separate {$5800.00} balance on to the same card under a separate promotional offer of 15 month 0 % APR. Since the first transfer and throughout the entire period since, I have made timely payments of at least my monthly minimum amount. 

Beginning with the statement for the period ending XX/XX/XXXX and through the statement for the period ending XX/XX/XXXX, these two balances were listed on page 2 of the statement under the "" Type of Balance '' section of the Interest Charge Calculation with two separate "" promotional rate expires '' dates assigned. The larger balance stated XX/XX/XXXX and the smaller balance XX/XX/XXXX. A copy of these two statements are attached. 

Sometime during the final weeks of XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted WellsFargo customer service for my credit card account, to inquire about the process for paying off my upcoming promotional balance transfer offer set to expire in XXXX. I spoke to a representative named XXXX. I explained to him that I wanted to pay off my balance for the amount due to expire on XX/XX/XXXX prior to its expiration to avoid finance charges. I had noticed that all of the payments I had made prior to this had been divided between the two separate balances and I wanted to know how to make the payment I made go completely to the balance expiring first. After a brief hold, XXXX informed me that I was able to do this by making two separate payments in XXXX. The first one should be for my minimum amount due. He told me that after XX/XX/XXXX, preferably on XX/XX/XXXX, I should then make a separate payment for the outstanding balance on the promotional amount expiring on XX/XX/XXXX. He said by doing this, the entire amount of my second payment would be allocated to that balance which had the 0 % APR expire on XX/XX/XXXX, therefore now being calculated at a higher rate. This would avoid having any go towards the second promotional balance still being charged 0 %. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called customer service again just to verify the information that XXXX had given me prior to making my payment. I spoke to a different representative, I do not recall her name, and explained to her my desire to pay off the amount expiring on XX/XX/XXXX. She told me the same information that XXXX had told me, only stating that I did not have to make two payments. She stated that whatever I paid over the minimum amount requested, would be allocated to the balance with the higher interest rate. If I made the payment after XX/XX/XXXX that amount would be the promotional balance which had expired on XX/XX/XXXX. Satisfied that I had received the same information from two separate representatives, I followed their instructions and made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX for {$8500.00}. This would cover the {$260.00} minimum payment and the {$8200.00} balance listed on my statement as expiring of XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received my statement for the period ending on XX/XX/XXXX online. I checked to see if the payment had been credited correctly, it was on XX/XX/XXXX, and was relieved to find no fees, or interest charges displayed on my statement. I was confused however to find that now on page 2 under "" Type of Balance '' there was a {$2800.00} promotional balance listed with an expiration of XX/XX/XXXX listed next to it. This was the first time seeing a balance with that date on my statement and I could not understand what this meant. I attempted to contact customer service to question this matter but was unable to reach anyone after repeated attempts and lengthy delays on hold. I continued calling the next day but was unsuccessful and gave up trying until Monday. 

On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I was able to speak to a representative named XXXX. I explained to her why I was confused as to the new promotional balance information on my statement, going through what had transpired with the phone conversations with the two other representatives. She looked at the statement information and also looked at the notes listed on my account and could not understand what had happened either. 
She attempted to contact a supervisor, as she stated she could not remedy the situation on her end, but due to the high volume of calls at the time was not able to. She did forward my concerns to be further researched and initiated a complaint inquiry for me, which she said would generate a call back within 2 to 3 days from someone in the corporate complaint department. 

On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX, I called customer service again. I spoke to a representative named  XXXX. I tried to get her to put me through to a supervisor directly, since I had already been told that customer service could not resolve this issue but she stated that if I could explain the issue she could better serve me. I went through the entire episode again, explaining about all of the previous calls and after looking at my account info, she too could not understand why there was now a different date on the statement. She was able to connect me with a supervisor, XXXX, and I explained everything again to him. He could not resolve the issue and connected me with someone who he stated was a corporate customer service representative. I do not recall this gentleman 's name, but he too was unable to explain to me what was going on. He did state that the new promotional expiration date had been created to be more in line with my statement ending date, but could not explain why there was even a balance assigned to that amount. 

As my frustration with getting an answer grew, this representative offered to assign my case to the complaint department so that someone could look into it and give me some answers. I explained that XXXX had already done this on Monday, and no one had contacted me yet. He then connected me with someone at the complaint department, since I already had a case assigned to me. The person I spoke to next had me once again explain exactly what my complaint was. His answer was limited, only stating that balance transfers do not have a grace period, and reemphasizing that the promotional date listed on my statement was adjusted to better coincide with my statement date. That made no sense to me and he refused to explain himself stating only that the representative assigned to the case would explain everything to me when he contacted me. He also stated that the representative had tried to contact me, which I told him was not possible since I had no missed calls or voicemails on my phone from their offices. I verified my contact information with him and he assured me someone would contact me to follow up. As of today 's date, I have not received a call, message, letter or email concerning this matter."
1433,"I was a customer of Wells Fargo bank in XXXX, Mt. XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX, checking accounts, bought 3 houses, sold and when I bought the last house owned it for 4 to 5 years, never late on payments, but got real sick, could'nt make payments, so tried to sell & rent it out till I was better, they would not work with me at all, so I had I to get a lawyer to help me, anyways Well Fargo sold the house had no problem selling it. I even payed the them more then my mortgage payments at times and still made payments even when I was'nt living there anymore, so I say between a renter that moved and me still making payments nobody living there got to point I just could do it anymore, so closed all my accounts between XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX?? so obviously I moved out, since then Wells Fargo has sent me a settlement check stating it was for a class action for {$10.00} to {$14.00} dollar, then sent, then sent me a credit card to use which I never asked for with a {$10000.00} credit line which I have never used still have it just filed it just thought it was strange and this was to my new e-mail & address and was sent XX/XX/XXXX sent me a email stating from WFsettlement.com for a XXXX   XXXX lawsuit ..I never deleted so if you need a copy of it let me know..If I got something coming to me that would be great, if not oh well ... confused!! and Thank You for your time, have a great day!!"
1437,"Wells Fargo credit card account number XXXX was opened to finance hearing aides. Initial Offer was finance free for 1 year with a {$3000.00} balance. This credit card has been open for approximately 2.5 years. Over the course of the credit loan, Wells Fargo has been charging {$38.00} each month as a late fee, offering no grace period of any kind but was never informed at the time when I established the account. Normally credit card offers some period after the established payment pull date. The fees have been exorbitant, creating a situation where it would have been paid off by now, however the fees have just continued to accrue."
1441,Card was opened sometime in 2014 later found out there was an individual in Colorado that had a fake copy if my SS card and a do with my name .This account was opened along with many others.I already sent this company a copy of policy report and proof of residency .I live in Texas.do NOT live I Colorado   or who where accounts were opened.already sent this company proof of residency for 4 years a year ago.this is hurting my credit.this is their fault.i was a victim of Id theft. My ss # ends in XXXX
1444,"Since XXXX, my name has been used for different loans and credit cards for different amounts of money. However, I got my XXXX number XX/XX/XXXX. I have only one debt with XXXX financial as of XX/XX/XXXX. When I log in to check my credit, there is XXXX account open in my name, that I did not open."
1445,"In XX/XX/XXXX I asked Wells Fargo to add a friend of mine to be an authorized user on my credit card account. I did not ask to add her as a joint account holder. She only had a card with her name on it. The account is mine and I opened it in XX/XX/XXXX. I recently asked Wells Fargo to make that card invalid and remove my friend as an authorized user. Wells Fargo reported to the credit bureau that the account was closed and this affected my friends credit score and it went down 100 points from XXXX to XXXX. The account is not closed and she was simply removed as an authorized user. My credit score was not affected at all because the account is still open and I am the account holder. 

This is unfair credit reporting. I know this because I am an authorized user on my employer 's credit card account. If I quit my job and they take me off as an authorized user this should not reflect on my credit history because my employer 's account will still be in good standing and I am not responsible for the account after I am removed as an authorized user and my credit history should not be affected. Wells Fargo is committing fraud by falsely reporting that my friend closed the account when the account is actually still open. This violates the fair credit reporting act."
1446,"I recieved notification that the rewards feature of my card was being upgraded. This was presented as a feature change so I did nothing. Later I was notified that a new card was being sent to me. This made no sense to me as my current card was still good to 2023. 

My current card has been declared inactive by the rewards department and my contact information was changed to the rewards department XXXX number. This access to my account online management seems to border on hacking. 

I have spent hours trying to restore my account to its previous status and I have a complaint number but no action is being taken on my requests. Instead I am being told that a new card is on its way and my current card is cancelled. 

None of this is by my request and I do not understand why I am being attacked this way. Further I feel my data is not safe with this company but if I close this account they still have my data to do with as they please."
1447,I was approved for a credit card with promotion but not knowingly denied promotion. At no time during the application or approval process I was informed I would not receive the promotion. I tried to proactively inquire when I was notified I was approved but the representative stated she did not have that information and would be available when I got the card. Needless to say I have no use for a new credit card with 15.99 % interest. I would have declined.
1449,"Wells Fargo had a credit card offer in XXXX with 3 % balance transfer fees with 0 interest. I emailed, then called to ask if they could match my XXXX limit of {$20000.00}. I told them I was only interested in an account if I got the same credit limit so I could make a substancial balance transfer. They told me on the phone I had to complete their application and they would answer me by mail. A week later they send me a card with a {$2500.00} limit. I called that day and told them I did not open the account, I only made an inquirey. I cut up the card and told them to void the account. They not only kept the account open but made a payment to my XXXX account without my permission and are billing me with fees. I've called, I've written to them. The bills keep coming and now this bogus account is on my credit report as late. In 19 years of credit history I have NEVER been late on a payment. Wells Fargo continues to open fraudulent accounts. Pease help!"
1450,"In XX/XX/2019, I received an email regarding my Wells Fargo credit card that my records have been changed to reflect an address change. The email went on to say that if I had not requested an address change to contact them immediately. 
I did so and the first representative, obviously in training, responded in a very cheery voice that he would look at my account. I stopped him and politely told him this matter was not a cheery event and to please not read from a script but to listen to my situation which I considered serious. After a long time on hold, the rep came back and explained that they received a notice from the post office of an address change. I explained that I have lived at my house for 18 years and my mortgage is with Wells Fargo as well. It seemed that he didn't know how to respond to what I just said and he repeated himself by saying when they get notice from the USPS, they must change the address. I asked for a supervisor and once she got my information and situation, she also gave me the same explanation of why my credit card address was changed. I was appalled that Wells Fargo would train employees to do a change of address with so little confirmation from the actual customer! 
In this time of protecting against fraud and identity theft, Wells Fargo using a notice from the USPS to change the address from a credit card account without verifying first is inexcusable! 
This is exactly why customers must be vigilant!!! I can not believe this happened. I am very upset. This is absolutely careless of Wells Fargo. I am responsible in keeping my credit in good standing and for Wells Fargo to have jeopardized this is outrageous!"
1451,"I set up a store card associated with Wells Fargo. At the time, I asked for the payment due date to fall on or after the XXXX of month. I was told that WF would not allow my wife and I to set payment, and due date would fall on XXXX. I have made 3 payments. The first payment was for {$1000.00} -- well beyond minimum payment. The last two were for the minimum payment. The most recent payments were made on the XXXX ( 48 hours after due date ). They charged {$39.00} for each late payment. 
I have two complaints : 1 ) it seems that WF is trying to manipulate due dates to enable them to access more late fees ( I asked for XXXX or XXXX ; they set at XXXX ; banks know most people are paid twice a month and that they may not always be able to make payments by XXXX ). 
2 ) they allow no grace period. I paid both payments by XXXX within 48 hours -- after I was paid. They should allow a grace period before late fees are charged. They have no such offering, which seems to allow them to maximize fees on the card. 

I called and they agreed to waive one but not both late fees even with I asked her to escalate the issue. 
Thanks for your consideration."

=============== Today, on XX/XX/XXXX I again logged in and found that the CC account has been closed, I noticed the "" Alert '' Message Center messages which were helpful in hindsight but didn't sufficiently notify me in time to do anything nor seemingly should be necessary other than to provoke an aggressive account closure. For example, I have never been required to engage in a trial deposit activity, other than automated credits and debits to an account which is being verified, except in the case of trying to pay my Wells Fargo XXXX after I had closed my XXXX  Checking accounts.

========== I hope that over the timeline it has been understood that : On XX/XX/XXXX I tried to use my XXXX Bank account to pay my Wells Fargo CC bill {$87.00} over my CC limit On XX/XX/XXXX I recieved pending trial balance notifications in the "" Alert '' center of the XXXX website and also in my email On XX/XX/XXXX I recieved a notification my CC payment is due in approximately XXXX week. 
Also on XX/XX/XXXX I recieve a message in the "" Alert '' section of the Wells Fargo website I will soon need to find my trial balances in my new bank account in order to have a verified payment method for my CC account in general. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I notice CC account closure and I am reduced to having repayment options but it could have occured at some point before XX/XX/XXXX. 

The chief complaint is the arbitrary placement of restrictions on payment methods and no text, call, or email messages warning of imminent account closure. The fact that this situation is only present when other XXXX accounts are closed does not indicate Wells Fargo is in-good-faith presenting viable methodologies for CC debt repayment in light of my experience. I hope for a resolution where XXXX can mitigate any damage done to credit scores by rescinding any notices and also provide a method for payment of my account which just yesterday was due XX/XX/XXXX and had a payment method submitted for more than 10 days. This payment method I tried to use I had checked in the payment section of my CC account to see if it was available to use more than once and through no fault of my own missed obfuscated messages."
1454,"I opened an account with wells fargo to buy furniture for my daughter. she was to make the payments. she accidently made a double payment on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. i called on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to a XXXX , who told me the extra payment would be credited back to my daughters account on XX/XX/XXXX. today is XX/XX/XXXX, still no credit. I called today XX/XX/XXXX and talked to XXXX and XXXX and was told it could take up to 10 business days to refund that money ... that's not what i was told by XXXX..wells fargo has been caught in shady business dealings recently and i'm afraid this might be another. my daugher isn't even sure she made a double payment by accident..just saw the money missing from her account..i told them i was contacting the ftc who referred me to this site."
1463,"XX/XX/XXXX CPFB Sirs : Please see the copy of letter with the incident which brought about this complaint. I must add the actual date that the physical card was received which was XX/XX/XXXX. Thanks and see below. 



XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL. XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Credit Bureau Dear Sirs : Please use this letter as my official response regarding a fraudulently submitted Credit Inquiry and Credit Card application submitted by a XXXX XXXX  Dept Store Associate at the XXXX Mall in XXXX, FL on XX/XX/XXXX. On the aforementioned date, a XXXX XXXX Men 's store Associate asked me about applying for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX after a debit card purchase. I immediately asked him if that was a Credit Card or just a loyalty card. He replied that it was not a Credit Card and it would not require a credit inquiry. 
I then advised him that with the housing crisis in XXXX, it would be unwise to have any credit inquiries as we may have to move and we didn't want an unethical or unqualified person using simple inquiries as their justification for rejection despite us having an excellent credit score. He also agreed and we proceeded with what I thought was to be a normal documentation process for a Non Credit Card Rewards program based on customer loyalty. During the paperwork process, he asked for income, which again I asked if this was a Credit card application. He again assured me that it wasn't. Shortly afterwards he advised that they had rejected me. Since it was stated that this was not a Credit Card application, I figured that the store probably had an income requirement that was higher than I had supplied as I did tell him that I was going to give him a lower amount as we had supplied it to an Apartment Complex last year, and they tried to manipulate us. Shortly afterwards I received a Dillard 's American Express card in the mail and I immediately contacted the telephone number on the card and told them I had not given anyone any authorization to apply for a Credit Card despite during the application process I was lied to regarding signing my signature during the paperwork process which was supposed to be a Non Credit Card Rewards Program. Numerous times during the process I told the Associate that I would not apply for a Credit Card and he always stated that it was not. My wife witnessed the entire process. After the telephone Associate processed his documentation for the dispute he told me that I could cut up the card, which I did. 

In conclusion, under the Uniform Commercial Code any transaction contracted by illegal means is "" Null and Void ''. The XXXX XXXX  Associate used Fraud and Misrepresentation to submit this Inquiry and Credit Application. Any reasonable investigation into my Credit will show that it is highly improbable that I did give someone authority to apply for a firm 's store Credit Card as the interest rates are always higher ; I have enough clean credit cards to make purchases, and with the housing market in XXXX, it would truly not be wise to attempt that These things in addition to the Associate saying the application had been rejected truly seems to be highly abnormal and strange behavior on the part of the XXXX Store Representative. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
1465,"Wells Fargo denied my credit application citing a reason that contradicts their own guidelines. This seems to be a discriminatory action, as explained below.

My recent application for a Cash Wise Visa card was declined. Reasons given in the decision letter of XX/XX/2019 are "" Ratio of credit bureau trades with a balance greater than zero '' and Number of revolving bankcards reported by credit bureau. 

According to the credit bureau cited in the letter ( XXXX  ),  my credit usage is 2 %, my credit score is XXXX out of XXXX, and the report has zero negative items. In other words, I am a responsible consumer with decades of excellent credit history. When I contacted Wells Fargo, they said my credit usage was too LOW to grant new credit. 

However, HIGH usage of credit is the frequently cited reason for denial, and all financial institutions advise customers to keep credit usage to a minimum. XXXX XXXX own website states Stay on top of how much youve borrowed against your available credit and aim to stay well below your credit limit. Keeping track of your spending will help you avoid using the entire credit limit, exceeding your credit limit, or missing payments. Keeping your credit utilization rate below 30 % may help you maximize your credit score.

The letter goes on to provide solutions, which constitute working with Wells Fargo to improve my credit rating over time and learn to use credit responsibly. Considering that my credit rating is already exceptional per the same letter ( XXXX out of XXXX ), these statements make no sense. 

Thus, the reason cited for denying my application directly contradicts Wells Fargos own policy. 

When I pointed out this discrepancy, phone customer service said it was the credit bureau 's decision. Clearly erroneous, as the letter states the reporting agency was not involved in the decision. 

Then I contacted the Wells Fargo XXXXxecutive office ( my email attached ). The agent who called me back said it was due to the possibility of me using up the huge amount of my available credit and defaulting on it. 

There is absolutely no evidence of such a possibility, since my credit history is spotless. Thus it seems that the adverse action against me was discriminatory, based on race and/or national origin. ( Such discrimination seems standard practice with Wells Fargo, considering the number of lending discrimination suits brought against them in recent years. )"
1468,"On closed accounts, this is the problem I'm having with Wells Fargo as a credit card company there trying to shut down the means of complaining after I shut down the credit card. I believe this techniques is being passed on to other banks, the problem with this is they can send the derogatory information instantly to my credit report and to me personally through the mail an email. And then they will accuse me of not caring about, and being slothful towards account. I've been using email to respond to them immediately when they do something wrong. I believe that is illegal I need answers to this this question if I need to go legal route I will."
1470,"I received a credit card offer in the mail from Wells Fargo Bank, and filled out a online application on XX/XX/20. They called me a few days later and said they needed me to go to a bank branch and show them 2 pieces of mail with my name and address on them and my drivers license, which I have never had anybody ask me to do before. But I went to the branch on XX/XX/20 and talked to XXXX XXXX and he faxed my papers to the credit card center, on XX/XX/20 I got a letter from them saying they would not offer me a credit card because my identity could not be verified. I have a 50 year perfect credit record I have never been turned down for anything. My application # is XXXX."
1472,"On XX/XX/2022, my personal checking account at Wells Fargo Bank held a balance of {$51000.00}. I went to my office the next day, XX/XX/2022, where I received a startling call from Wells Fargo telling me that they had picked up numerous transactions in my account that they wanted to verify with me that appeared unusual. They then read a list of XXXX very similar charges to my account. I wrote down all the transactions and they were all in the range of {$20.00} to {$24.00}. I recognized none of them and Wells Fargo said they would "" look into them. '' I asked them to stop the charges, because none of them were mine. 
I heard nothing further from Wells Fargo until approximately XX/XX/2022 when a very large envelope arrived in my office from XXXX, containing the largest bank statement I have ever seen. It consisted of XXXX pages and contains a list of well over 3000 separate transactions in my bank account, all for the month of XX/XX/2022. I recognize only about 50 transactions which I made in XX/XX/2022 that day or the rest of the month. I had personal XXXX for over 7 hours on XX/XX/XXXX, did not use the credit card in question and had in my personal possession at all times. I still have the card in question.. The remaining transactions are completely unknown to me and were not made by me. I did deposit an additional {$17000.00} in the account and my social security check was also deposited in my account for me. I have also since discovered that an additional {$20000.00} was deposited in this account by being taken from a Wells Fargo credit line I held and put into my account without my knowledge. At the end of XXXX, despite deposits of {$92000.00}, the account balance is {$1800.00}. This means that a total of {$90000.00} was removed from my account without my knowledge, permission or consent. I have called, spoken with and sought answers innumerable times from Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo 's sole response so far is a brief letter telling me that one charge in the amount of {$19.00} was not an error and that it will stand. What they do not mention is their additional transaction fee of XXXX for each of the over 30,000 charges shown on my bank statement and that there are approximately 3000 transactions in that amount. I have calculated that they have made over {$2000.00} in fees by allowing me to be robbed of over {$90000.00} that they have no time to explain. Please explain to me how this is allowed to happen in our Federally regulated banking system."
1473,"I opened a credit card with Well 's Fargo Visa card in XX/XX/2019 and never used it. On or about XXXX I noticed a transaction for {$2700.00} from my mobile app for a balance transfer. I immediately contacted Well 's Fargo and they put me in contact with the Fraud department and the Fraud department said that they would take care of the matter. 

On XX/XX/2019 I received a letter from Well 's Fargo Claim Assistance Center Credit Card Fraud Claim stating that I was responsible for an unauthorized transaction for {$2700.00} for a balance transfer.

I never did a balance transfer with Well 's Fargo, as this is fraud. I have contacted Well 's Fargo and I keep getting the same response that someone will take care of the issue and never do."
1476,"I am a victim of identity theft. Due to the Corona Virus Pandemic, we are all facing which has me sitting still at home and I saw the recent news about the multiple XXXX Data breaches. I decided to look at my credit reports from the 3 major credit bureaus and found that someone had used my Identity. I have no idea how the theft took place. I also have no knowledge of any suspects. I did not receive any money, goods, or services as a result of identity theft. I contacted the Credit Bureau and told me to file an Identity Theft Report which I am doing. I appreciate your effort in getting this matter resolved. Thank you. Please let me know if you need any other information from me to block this information from my credit report. Thank you."
1481,"Hi and how are you doing? Im not sure who to take this to anymore, but Ive disputed this account several times with both the original creditor and the credit reporting agencies accordingly and Ive attached everything to support my dispute. However, I continue to received a pre-template letter sent to me that its been verified and it REMAINS. How is it possible that this was verified if you continue to report incomplete, inconsistent, inaccurate, and unverifiable information on this account and a thorough and in-dept investigation. Ive disputed and I havent received anything as such, but it continues to be reported in violation of the consumer laws."
1484,"Hello, I have a purchase on my well Fargo credit card on XX/XX/2019, amount is {$47.00} this is fraud. I didn't make this purchase and don't know what is this. please tell them to fix it."
1485,"On XX/XX/2020 I was having my hair styled in XXXX XXXX, California. 
I got a phone call when I got home by Wells Fargo saying there was "" suspicious activity '' on the XXXX credit card. They asked me if I was at XXXX XXXX, XXXX, buying pants, XXXX XXXX, etc. I said I only was at the hair stylist and confirmed the amount! The Proper Response Should have been "" Don't Worry-you got hacked! Let us handle it. '' Instead ... 1.5 Years Later ... Wells Fargo REFUSES to make good and take responsibility-saying I told them my card was stolen, and THEN saying it wasn't. I have PROOF from the stylist signed by her saying I was with her from before noon to early evening-making it IMPOSSIBLE for me to be anywhere else!!! This is CROOKED THIEVING Wells Fargo-who got BUSTED by the US Senate for $ $ {$3.00} BILLION for opening up PHONY accounts of their customers! I reported them to the XXXX  and it is on record! Even EVERY Late Night TV host has SLAMMED Wells Fargo for being "" The XXXX '', etc. This has caused me LOADS of stress and time and THIEVING BULLIES must NOT be allowed to operate in our free country like this!!!"
1486,I had a wellsfargo bank account and had a credit card with them. Then my debit card got stolen and they started doing fraudulent stuff in my account and Wells Fargo chose to close my accounts. It was closed on XX/XX/2016.
1487,"I submitted a dispute to Wells Fargo, Disputed ID XXXX, posting date XX/XX/2020 in the amount of {$270.00} I indicated to Wells Fargo that I did not recognize the charge and that I wanted further details as to exactly what the charge was for. 

I received a response indicating that the "" merchant name '' for the charge of {$270.00} was "" XXXX '' However, "" XXXX '' is not a merchant but rather a third party billing service."
1489,"I have tried to get this handled multiple times through cfpb and wells fargo directly. The last complaint letter from Wells Fargo specifically stated to start a police report in any jurisdiction, which I have done. I emailed & faxed them the details on this, but have not yet heard back from them in regards to the fraud complaint / case. I will be re-attaching all of the details from my previous cases and appeals with Wells Fargo. This has been going on since XX/XX/2018. 

I will not re-detail all of the information on the case here, but it is all in the attachments. In summary : ( 1 ) I disputed the charges as fraud ( 2 ) I followed all the directions provided to me by the credit card company ( 3 ) I have opened the police report as required by the credit card company ( 4 ) I still have not received a satisfactory response / credit to my account to void out all of the fraud charges ( 5 ) This has been severely hurting my own credit at this time due to Wells Fargo 's negligence."
1490,"Wells Fargo allowed Fraudulent Charges on both my XXXX Credit Card and My Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX after my wallet was stolen. I reported these charges to Wells Fargo as soon as I learned the Cards were missing after being pickpocketed in a grocery store. Wells Fargo did not investigate the fraud, They temporarily credited my account for one day and then Reversed all of the Fraud Charges back to my account ( s ) When I called Wells Fargo "" Claims Assistance Center '' To Discuss the fraud case, I was told that the Investigator had discovered that per "" Dispute Notes '' I had previously done business with one of the fraudulent merchants. Which again is not true. This issue wasn't investigated and Wells Fargo is now charging me over {$14000.00} In Fraudulent Charges. I should not be responsible for Fraudulent charges when I reported this promptly and Wells Fargo Terms and Conditions state they have a ZERO LIABILITY GUARANTEE. However as you can see from the screenshots of my online banking. There were "" Several Bank Adjustments '' That were not charges not credits mind you. The Lady in the Claims Assistance Center didn't care to hear what I had to say and told me they will escalate my complaint to the "" Executive Office '' Which again never heard anything back. I do not have an XXXX Account The Merchant is fraud, Nor Do I do business with a "" XXXX XXXX '' Or XXXX Eats. All of these merchants are fraud and I don't even have credentials to login to any of these because they were never my accounts. How can you charge someone fraudulent debt and expect them to pay fraudulent charges when it goes against your own policies and it wasn't investigated either. I already told Wells Fargo I do not do business with these merchants and have not. Additionally one of the charges for a "" XXXX XXXX '' they sent a receipt that has no signature on it. Doesn't look like my writing on the tip either. So again, Fraudster used it "" Yet wells fargo verified the charges '' Again. I do not believe I should be responsible for fraudulent charges that I promptly reported. These Charges are causing the credit lines to be over for both cards and it's because of the uber charges, the favor charges, and the stub hub charges all which took place online that were not authorized."
1494,Called Wells Fargo about interest rate on the visa personal credit card. They said can not negotiate interest rate. It is based on what you agreed to at time of application for card. I have had card for 20 years or more. I requested copies of all documents I signed regarding this card by letter on XX/XX/2021. On XXXX XXXX I received a form regarding the terms of my credit card account. I have not received the documents I requested. I believe they do not have anything signed by me and do not have the authority to charge any interest. My initial application was with a bank Wells Fargo bought. I never received anything about applying for a Wells Fargo credit card. Just received one in mail after they bought out my bank.
1495,"To Whom This May Concern at the Federal Trade Commission : Case # XXXX I hope you are well. 

On XX/XX/2020, upon calling ( without a working voice ) the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, I had the grave misfortune of interacting with XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX regarding attempts to pay my financial responsibility and to be treated with respect. 
1 ) XXXX ~ was no help as she told me that my payment method is a problem and she could not help ; rather than seek resources. 
2 ) XXXX ~ relentlessly harassed me after I repeatedly requested for a manager and I was firmly denied. XXXX was extremely persistent, dominating, controlling, ignorant and aggressively/rudely told me that she can take my payment. XXXX 's forceful verbiage of 'taking my payment ' gave me the strong and clear impression that she only cared about collecting funds and neglectful of human treatment. With this frightful encounter, XXXX made me emotionally and incredibly uncomfortable with her clear violation of my boundaries. XXXX made an unrelated comment about 'with everything that is going on in the world '? At this point, I had no choice but to hang up on her. 
3 ) XXXX/Advocacy ~ surprisingly and appallingly defended XXXX 's comment to me. 
4 ) XXXX, XXXX 's superior/manager ~ was THE WORST. XXXX was unfriendly, repeatedly cut me off, sounded very controlling and arrogant with his position in the company, habitually phrased, "" obviously '' to me when nothing was obvious. I AM NOT YOUR EMPLOYEE. When I attempted to share my phone experience with XXXX and notified him that his staff seemed incompetent, XXXX REPEATEDLY THREATENED TO END THE CALL IF I DID NOT STOP USING NEGATIVE WORDS ABOUT HIS STAFF. XXXX told me that he does not allow negative comments about his staff. 
5 ) Upon filing an official complaint on the listed individuals, I was provided the above case number for reference per XXXX/Case Manager Department and I am to receive an email response in approximately 10 days. I have no time to waste. I should not have to wait 10 days. 
I yet again contacted the company, spoke to XXXX who referred me to the Corporate level at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, only to discover, per XXXX on XX/XX/2020, that this contact phone number is the wrong contact. What a complete waste of my valuable time. Is this company that disorganized? 
6 ) I was then, transferred back to the internal department and attempted to communicate with XXXX/Advocate who was absolutely clueless and unhelpful. 

*I have and continue to lose sleep due to this inhumane and mortifying experience. I am numb, drained and mentally traumatized by this ongoing ordeal. This 'company ' does not deserve business. 
PLEASE ADVISE AS PROMPTLY AS POSSIBLE AS I DO NOT WISH TO CONTINUE ASSOCIATING WITH SUCH A DEMEANING AND DEPLORABLE ENTITY. 

Thank you for your time."

1499,"My credit card issuer, Wells Fargo Bank, assessed with an APR interest rate hike beginning in my XXXX of 2016 from a 9.490 % to a 28.740 %.

I did provide that information and they stated Wells Fargo would follow up with me directly for additional fraud reporting. I received a Declaration of Fraud in the mail from Wells Fargo to complete by XX/XX/2022. The Declaration also asks for my SSN and I am uncomfortable proceeding further at this time."

1507,"I had contacted Wells Fargo Credit Card Services for my XXXX XXXX card on XX/XX/2020 when I went to make a payment on my credit card that I saw my card balance was extremely high and there were four fraudulent charges that I did not authorize. Two back to back charges with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2020, for {$450.00} and {$120.00}, respectively. Then there was another charge on XX/XX/2020 for {$100.00} at target, and finally on XX/XX/2020 a charge of {$220.00} at a vendor that says XXXX XXXX. 
I was on the Wells Fargo Payment assistance program for my credit card payments prior to all of this, since I had still been out of work due to COVID and have been very frugal in spending, having not used the card for months during this time period. 
I called them on XX/XX/2020 to make them aware of the fraudulent charges and to let me know what I could do, they said they will help take care of it. Fast forward to XX/XX/2020, I see a balance transfer and Wells Fargo put all of the fraudulent charges back onto my account saying that I am liable for them when I never authorized the charges to begin with."
1510,"This complaint is against Wells Fargo. 

My credit card with Wells Fargo was hacked and {$7000.00} of fraudulent charges were made on it starting in XXXX of 2018. The established pattern of banking consisted of 2-3 transactions per month, simply transferring funds from the credit card to my checking account in large dollar amounts ; typically {$2000.00} to {$3000.00} at a time ; as I managed cash flow. This pattern was in process for approximately 12 months. When the account was hacked, there were suddenly dozens of transactions per day in small dollar amounts made to XXXX and XXXX accounts. 

Wells Fargo failed to notice the unusual account activity and when I discovered the problem and brought it to the attention of their fraud department, they took no responsibility for the problem and refused to reimburse me for the stolen funds. They stated in a letter that since I had paid my bill, that I automatically accept all charges made on the account. This is unacceptable negligence and the poorest customer care I can imagine.

My complaints are the following : 1. Wells Fargo does not seem to have an effective system in place to detect unusual account activity or bank fraud.

2. Wells Fargo does not bear responsibility for failing to secure their customers bank accounts when they are compromised."

She stated she would take the payment and dispute the incorrect error on wells Fargo part because they had been hanging on to my mail as well. I paid the XXXX with no problem as I knew it was owed and paid late fees but they agreed to fix the pass due on my credit
1513,"Wells Fargo Nationwide marketing group. I purchased furniture with 12 months no interest financing from them. The furniture was delivered in two separate deliveries and consequently, there are two separate special term balances with different end dates. I receive one statement with a single minimum payment due. Wells Fargo applies separate minimum payments against each of the two balances. They do not apply the full payment against the balance with special financing that expires the soonest. The documentation does not state how much of a minimum payment is required against each balance. In discussing this with the company, they can not provide the minimum balance for next month. This makes it difficult to pay off the balance without paying deferred interest since I have no idea how much of my payment will be applied against the longer term balance. My contention is, if there are indeed minimum payments required against each balance then they should be clearly spelled out."
1514,"To whom it may concern, I am submitting this complaint regards to a transaction in the amount of {$660.00} made on my Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa card ending in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( Dispute # XXXX ). 

I am owed a full refund on this purchase as the merchant did NOT provide the services that had been promised. Effectively, the merchant charged me for services that they did NOT provide. I had to pay the merchant before any services could possibly be rendered. However, after paying the merchant the full amount, the merchant FAILED to deliver and repair my vehicle as promised. And now, they're trying to claim money ( {$660.00} ) that does NOT belong to them as they rendered NO services. 

I contacted the merchant on XX/XX/XXXX and they confirmed via email that a full refund IS owed. 

I would like a full refund at this time as I will NOT be paying {$660.00} to a merchant that did NOT provide the services that had been promised. That is beyond deceitful and moves into the territory of fraud. As such, I expect a full refund especially since the merchant themselves had now confirmed that a FULL refund is owed."

It tells the customer either the minimum amount owed ( {$20.00} ) or the full amount charged to date, which is larger than the amount currently owed. The customer service representative I spoke to said she had brought this problem up to the IT department several times but they refuse to change it. They do not provide the current amount owed on the current bill so that a customer will either 1 ) pay the minimum amount and incur a huge service charge. or 2 ) pay the full amount of the current charges on the card so that Wells Fargo can use their money and get interest from it. Wells Fargo is still deceiving their customers and over-charging them because their executives are still criminals. This would be quite easy to resolve but Wells Fargo refuses to do so. Please take action to force Wells Fargo to be fair to their customers."

They had also added incorrect interest charges of {$1.00} and {$1.00} to the billing statements of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX respectively. I emailed them on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ; however, Wells Fargo was not willing to make correction. On XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed them stating that I would report to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau If Wells Fargo was not willing to make correction. 
Then, they added credit in the amount of {$2.00} to adjust the incorrect interest charges of {$1.00} and {$1.00}. The changes are shown in the statement of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 

These recent unjustified charges are in addition to the problems I filed in complaint # XXXX which they fixed only after I reported to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 

These recurring additions of unwarranted fees and interest charges to my billing statements, even after informed them, are intentional acts of harassment. 

I am attaching the billing statements from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX for your reference.

1532,On XX/XX/2022 I was on line with Wells Fargo through my online account. They advertised balance transfers at 0 % for 18 months. I transferred {$11000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. When I received my credit card statement the interest rate was 25.49 %. See attached.
1534,"I have, with help from my daughters, tried to close my bank accounts and credit cards at wells Fargo. I moved from XXXX XXXX XXXX  in XXXX of XXXX. There is no Wells Fargo branch here and after 6 calls I still have not been able to close the Card account.

In the first place the card account was opened without my knowledge. 
When I called to close all accounts they closed the checking but not the card. the fees then overdrew my account. 
My daughter was on the phone with me when the 4th call was made and all we got was run around. She got upset and called it fraud at which point they transferred the call to the fraud department. That person closed the account and said a new card would be mailed. We told her to just close the account..NO new account. No new card! They did it anyway.

Called again with my other daughter and got transferred around again and after 20 minutes on the phone the women said she would close the account. She said please hold and disconnected the call.

Seems that Wells Fargo can't get away from there evil ways of scamming and misleading people."
1536,Wells Fargo has made it incredibly annoying when trying to pay a credit card payment. I called in to make a payment with a debit card and was told that to use my debit card I would also need to provide my routing and account number. I don't have access to this information and I know there are plenty of other people out there who also don't carry this stuff around with them. I want to make a payment with a debit card but I can't because to use a debit card they want ACH information. This seems strange especially since debit cards are often used to avoid giving out routing and account number. This is incredibly frustrating.
1537,Reviewed my credit report last month and is showing Wells Fargo as reported balance of {$1400.00} with all National Credit Bureaus. I have made several attempts for validation of this alleged account. Til date I have not received any validation of this account.

I called Wells Fargo costumer service and discussed with them I have never requested them about fradulant charges by that company. They told me they want their money for investigating that charge. I contacted their executive office asking them to reimburse me for the {$45.00} they had charged XXXX. I just git a letter of denial stating "" We are committed to protecting the security of our costumer 's accounts and periodically need to take certain actions to detect and prevent fraud. '' In other words, I, the card holder am stuck with the {$45.00} penalty fee they charged my email service provider, wrongfully penslized by Wells Fargo credit card company.

On XX/XX/2021 we contacted the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX customer service, we told them that our XXXX XXXX  account had been suspended. We stated that any charges going forward from XXXX XXXX would be unauthorized by us, as we were not able to access the product that we had purchased. 
On XX/XX/2021, we were charged the {$69.00}, again for XXXX XXXX, but still not able to access the subscription. We made repeated attempts to reach XXXX XXXX to settle the matter. 
On XX/XX/2021, after repeated attempts to reach XXXX XXXX to no avail we contacted Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX customer service to dispute the unauthorized charge. 
On XX/XX/2021, we were charged again for the service that we have explained twice already, the situation. 
Minutes after I got off the phone with Wells Fargo customer service, they did not reimburse me for charges, but they charged me for the past months. This is concerning because each time I attempt to contact the company I am transferred several times to people where I was made to repeat my address, telephone number, social security number, etc. The last time I contacted them, I was transferred 12 times - each time I had to repeat my personal information. 
I specifically closed my credit card because they were not stopping the unauthorized charges, knowing that my credit score would take a hit. 
We were charged {$69.00} twice after telling Wells Fargo customer service that any charges going forward would be unauthorized. 
I was never sent any confirmation or mail for any of these disputes that I have filed, despite them telling me that I was sent a resolution letter. I asked twice for a copy of the resolution letter, and have still not received it to this day."

After noticing the charges on my card, a few hours after they were made, I immediately turned off my card, and called Wells Fargo to notify them of the charges. By the time Wells Fargo had turned off the card, there were a total of 7 charges on the card totaling {$1800.00}. The Wells Fargo representative gave me a claim number and told me that Wells Fargo would do an investigation into the charges and let me know within 10 days. After 10 days had passed with no call from Wells Fargo, I called them and they informed me that since the person who used my card had the PIN number, that they did not see anything fraudulent and denied my claim. I informed Wells Fargo that they probably had my PIN number from a phone call I received in which an automated womans voice which said that it was XXXX XXXX fraud prevention and that they had a suspicious charge on my account and that in order to block the charges I had to press 2. After doing so that same call asked me to type in my PIN number to verify that. 
At the time I didnt think anything about it, however later that night, my wife later told me it was probably a scam and that I should check into it, which I did. It was at that time that I noticed the fraudulent charges. I even gave Wells Fargo the phone number that they called me from. ( XXXX ) Obviously I was upset and asked what is the next step I can take to get my money back and the representative told me to call the police and have them conduct an investigation and then I could submit that additional information once completed for them to review. I called my local police and they had XXXX. XXXX XXXX conduct an investigation. He found video of the person using their phone ( XXXX XXXX app ) with my card info to make some of these purchases. He was unable to get a license plate of their vehicle or any other information that could lead to the actual identity of this person but was able to clearly determine that it was not me who had made these charges. I also had video of myself at home during the time that these charges were made. I sent a copy of the detectives report as well as the video of me at home back to Wells Fargo for them to review and hopefully prove that I was not the person who had made these charges. After a few days passed after sending them this new information I called them to get an update and they again informed me that they were still denying my claim. 
At this point I have no idea what to do and feel helpless in the effort to get my money back. After searching online, I found that other people had this happen to them and after getting the CFPB involved, they were able to get it cleared up. I hope this is the case for me."

This incorrect information hurts my ability to secure increased lines of credit because I am not able to demonstrate a history of paying off larger balances with the current incorrect information. I contacted XXXX  and tried to dispute the information on that end but they explained that it was Wells Fargo that supplies the information. Additionally, WF has not updated my credit card balance for the past two months, even though they reported inaccurate monthly payments. I would like updated information to be supplied to the reporting agencies. 

For example, XX/XX/XXXX, WF reported a {$25.00} payment, actual payment was {$320.00}. XX/XX/XXXX, WF reported {$25.00}, actual payment was {$250.00}. XX/XX/XXXX, WF reported {$25.00} ( actual payment {$150.00} ). XX/XX/XXXX, WF reported {$51.00} ( actual payment {$150.00} ).  XX/XX/XXXX, WF reported {$49.00} ( actual payment {$100.00} ). XX/XX/XXXX, WF reported {$53.00} ( actual payment {$100.00} ). XX/XX/XXXX, WF reported {$57.00} ( actual payment {$200.00} ). XX/XX/XXXX, WF reported {$56.00} ( actual payment {$150.00} ). XX/XX/XXXX, WF reported {$53.00} ( actual payment {$150.00} ). XX/XX/XXXX, WF reported {$53.00} ( actual payment {$400.00} ). XX/XX/XXXX, WF reported {$56.00} ( actual payment {$300.00} )."
1564,"This is in regards to my wells fargo credit card account ending XXXX. This is an account that wells fargo closed I believe because of the number of days delinquent it had become ( 3 payments behind with a balance of about 11K ). This happened around XX/XX/2018. A XXXX dollar payment was made in XX/XX/2018 and then {$7800.00} worth of payments were made in the month of XXXX. In XXXX I make a XXXX payment. In XXXX my credit card minimum payment is XXXX.. I made several attempts to have this clarified with no resolve. Finally, I reached someone but its after the due date. I paid the minimum amount due of XXXX prior to due date. I called the wf I asked how did you come up with a XXXX balance on XXXX. The rep then put me on hold for 10 minutes comes back and says we changed your monthly payment amount on XXXX to XXXX every month to help you get caught up. I told her she was a liar. That someone in the collections department or else where was attempting to illegally gains late fee 's on my account by causing a minimum fee amount that's to high. In addition its retaliatory for me being in collections. I can imagine that since XXXX was my min. monthly payment in the month of XX/XX/2018 that someone put a lock or something on my account to only post payments of XXXX or higher to roll the account out of delinquency. Thats fine and dandy that they do that but they have to remove it the following month or it creates issues. My current statement shows zero amount due in XXXX so if my minimum payment was XXXX every month why dont I have a payment due now. Just like their reported software malfunctions that occurred forcing homeowners into foreclosure. The american people know it was no software error. It was to clear out delinquency numbers so they could take one major loss come back the following quarter with better delq numbers since they flushed as many consumers out at one time. Tactical advantage when looking at long term stock growth."
1567,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX i never signed for any of these charges and I never provided my credit card as none of these charges show that my credit card was swiped or used. 

I contacted WF when I saw the charge on XX/XX/XXXX that this was not my charge and that I had heard from XXXX that they had issues with charges being placed on credit cards from information they had obtained. XXXX directed me to contact WF to remove the fraudulent charges. I asked WF to block this merchant so it would not occur again and they stated they blocked them. I contacted WF and asked them to block this merchant every time another charge appeared the next month. WF told me they blocked them but failed to do so. Finally, the last month a charge appeared WF informed me that it showed that I requested to block the merchant but the prior reps had not properly blocked the merchant so this rep blocked them. Then no more charges appeared. 

I have filed this Complaint and Reconsiderations with Wells Fargo multiple times and they just ignore it, fail to remedy, and state that I am responsible because I continued to pay on the account as several letters from WF state. They claimed it was sent to fraud and nonfraud. 

I was told immediately that the person handling this matter was new and failed to properly file the claim. WF may then have been out of time to file the claim so failed to resolve it. 

i will never pay for these charges as they are not my responsibility. WF mishandled the claims all along and are responsible to correct them. This has taken up huge amounts of my credit, caused huge interest charges, and lowered my credit as a result."
1568,"I applied for a wells fargo secured card on XX/XX/XXXX and was approved. Later on my wells fargo banking app the account was showing as closed and I called to asked what happened. At NO point did the representative state the account wasn't funded and. Later I received a letter stating the account hadn't been funded and it would be closed if not funded. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I called Wells fargo to Fund the account per the statements give on the letter. Earlier that day I deposit the Full amount for the secured deposit into my Wells Fargo account in order to make this process as seamless as possible. I called and made the deposit. After making the deposit the representative informed me that the process was extending from 7-10 business days to almost a month out. At that point I asked if there was anyway to get a temporary card. They stated no. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was transferred to see if anything could be done. After speaking to a supervisor I asked for the account to just be closed out as it was going to take way to long to process everything. while speaking with the supervisor I stated that I had just called and paid the deposit on the account and wanted to ensure that this would not be processed out and that the funding would be cancelled. The supervisor kept telling me I didn't fund the account. Despite me just having been on the phone to fund said account. The supervisor transfered me to another manager where I once again explained since the account process could not be speed up i wanted the account closed and I wanted to make sure that the funding request would not go through. They keep informing me the account was not funded. At which put I asked for the complaint to be move up to the executive office.  Today XX/XX/XXXX wells Fargo executive office called at XXXX at night to inform me they were following up on my complaint from over a month ago. Although you are promised a 30 day response time. I had to called back as they called my work number which is clearly listed as my work number in my wells fargo account and it was not the number I originally called on my complaint. The customer service representative had to transfer me over to the representative after I reviewed the voicemail which listed a number that was disconnected. I spoke with XXXX who read me a statement written by the last representative that my complaint was my account was closed and I wasn't informed. Which was not my complaint. My complaint was that I was not receiving an answer on the funding for the account being taken out and the poor customer service I recieved. XXXX once again told me the account was closed due to lack of funding. I informed XXXX I felt this was a one sided complaint that never asked me for my issue and was clearly keyed incorrectly as it listed the wrong complaint information and the wrong contact number. I tried once again to explain to XXXX that Wells Fargo still tried to take the funding out of my account even after I had "" closed '' the account. And wells fargo is still stating that the account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX due to lack of funding rather than my request to close it due to the difficult process and long timeline. Attached you will find various information that shows how wells fargo customer service confused the situation multiple time and never addressed my complaints and made the secured funding and cancellation process difficult. It shows my nearly 40 minute call on XX/XX/XXXX my discuss via the message center on XX/XX/XXXX explaining how I was charged a {$35.00} fee ( that was reversed ) by wells fargo for insufficient funds when they tried to pull the {$300.00} funding for a "" closed '' account. How I opened an account with another company that was a simple 8 day process. My multiple phone calls and conversation with them. The atm receipt prior to my call on XX/XX/XXXX providing the funding amount was available in the account. The voicemail that was left for me by the executive office and various other pieces."
1569,My card was closed on a {$0.00} balance. Now Wellsfargo credit card attempt to collect {$200.00} on a purchase that was disputed and resulted before my card was closed.
1570,"XX/XX/XXXX I did a zero interest balance transfer with my Wells Fargo XXXX that had a zero balance at the time of the transfer. 
XX/XX/XXXX I had a fraudulent charge on my card interest began to accrue once it was discovered WF credited my account the full amount plus interest. 

Around the XX/XX/XXXX I noticed they were still charging me interest on the fraudulent charge. On XX/XX/XXXX they reversed the interest charges and was promised that it was resolved and it would not happen again. I was also told that they would monitor the account to assure it didn't happen again. 

XX/XX/XXXX interest was charged again. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called to report it and was told that someone within WF had check the account and did nothing to correct it. They are now opening yet another case file to investigate this. 

Since WF has a history of this XXXX, I thought you should be aware and could look into this possible affecting other people as well."
1572,"This particular account situation that is lately filing on my own credit document has a seriously unfavorable relation to my personal ability to obtain a present loan application. I highly recommend you generate verification that WELLS FARGO has been reported completely in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act regulations, it's really a serious problem to mis-report. Moreconfirmation of the aforesaid item too. My proper request mustover, I was never 30 days/60 days/120 days late in any of my payments and I'm not greatly tuned in to the date opened so I prefer to ask you be investigated as soon as possible and confirmed to be correct. Thanks!"
1573,I have requested help previously with my wells fargo account Account # XXXX in regards to a late reported to XX/XX/2020 which occurred during the unprecedented time which has impacted me. Along with that A financial accommodation was made for the late payment in XX/XX/2020 fees were waived. On the latest credit report it lists a late pay in XX/XX/2020. According to the CARES ACT if any accommodation has been made no late pays may be reported to the consumer reporting agencies. If you fail to make the correction this may make you liable for willful negligence ( FCRA 1681 )

The following charges left my card in over drawn fee : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX They replaced the overdrawn fees but denied my claim with no explanation why.

1576,"To whom it may concern : I am writing to complain about my banks handling of my credit card starting this past XXXX. 
In XXXX of this year, I called my Wells Fargo customer phone number to make a payment and told the representative that I could not afford to make my regular payment due to financial hardship. My main job that brings in most my income drastically reduced my hours/income and I was having trouble and still having trouble paying my bills. This job was affected by the COVID-19 and resulting impact was a major reduction in my income. So the rep on the phone said Wells Fargo had a COVID hardship program and I could defer payment two months in a row. I said yes to the program but a few days later I found out my card declined and I had almost {$12000.00} left of credit available on that card and found out the credit line was reduced to a little over {$8000.00} which left me with only {$100.00} of credit to spend on my card. I was furious when I found this out, as I have been with Wells Fargo for about 30 years and worked my rear off to get a gold standing credit card with a high credit line over the years. So I filed a complaint and I got letters about 5 altogether saying we would forward complaint to their Executive Office. Most the reps that I called on these letters said the same thing, we are looking into the matter, but most would not return my calls. One such rep XXXX XXXX at phone XXXX never returned my call when I left message saying I was furious and needed an expanation why would they do such an inhumane thing to a consumer, especially during this COVID pandemic. On XX/XX/XXXX, I finally got a letter in the mail stating they decreased my creditline from {$2000.00} to {$8600.00}, due to a risk- based decision. This credit card now left me with about {$100.00} to spend on the card. 
I was furious and even tried to elicit the support of a local Wells Fargo branch manager on XX/XX/XXXX, Ms. XXXX, of whom was sympathetic, and said she would file a complaint on my behalf. But still nothing happened and I continued to get letters from Wells Fargo Executive office saying, we are sorry, but we are looking in the matter. 

I am furious at my bank how they handled this and how could they do such a heartless, greedy maneuver when I have been a hard working customer of theirs for 30 years. 
I want mu credit limit returned and think this move by Wells Fargo is disgusting and I would pull out all my business with them, but I have so many automatic debits/ payroll arrangements with them it is very inconvenient for me to do that. Please can you help with this horrible greedy sucking entity of a bank Wells Fargo?"
1577,"Wells Fargo Credit Card opened in my name without my permission or knowledge, person ran up over {$50000.00} in debt before I became aware of the problem, canceled the card immediately upon knowledge. 
Wells Fargo refused any help with the matter, this was during the time period of fraud the CFPB fined Wells Fargo {>= $1,000,000} but before the problem was made public. 
I 'm looking for restitution and penalties and restoration of my financial credit reporting."
1583,"We ran up a large debt ( {$12000.00} ) on our Wells Fargo credit card. With an interest rate of 27.74 %, we are paying payments of {$500.00} with {$280.00} in interest alone. We called on XX/XX/2019, and talked to an employee and then supervisor in the department responsible for financial hardship. We are trying to reduce our interest payments on all credit card debts as we are expecting a second child in XXXX of this year, and need to plan for more expenses to raise a healthy child. All other credit card companies have granted meaningful financial hardship requests except Wells Fargo. 

They stated Wells Fargo does not offer APR reductions for financial hardship, at least not for us. They could not tell us why we didn't qualify for it, or if Wells Fargo even offers APR reductions. All they could offer was a 3 month reduction in minimum monthly payments. Any deficit below the minimum monthly would be added onto the next month 's payment. It would do nothing to address the interest that makes it so hard to pay back this credit card. The short period with no reduction of interest means we can not meaningfully pay back any amount that would reduce the lifetime payback amount on this card. 

We filed a complaint with Wells Fargo Executive Dept, complaint ID XXXX. They stated they would return our call and allow us to write a letter. They would not say where we could address a letter of complaint to. They indicated their policy would not change no matter what."
1584,"All evens notated occurred in the year XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX - Credit card balance through Wells Fargo was paid off ; card was believed to have been temporarily blocked to keep credit limit/line open for credit score-building reasons. 

*Somewhere between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX my Online/Mobile Access was locked out ; I didn't think anything of it due to having card paid off and assumed it to be blocked. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Fraudulent transaction XXXX NOT made by me ) for {$190.00} to "" XXXX XXXX '' was assessed to what was assumed to be a blocked card. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Second fraudulent transaction ( again, NOT made by me ) for {$190.00} to "" XXXX XXXX '' was assessed to the "" blocked '' card. Also, there is a {$190.00} credit back onto the card from "" XXXX XXXX, '' effectively cancelling the SECOND transaction. The first transaction remains. 

XX/XX/XXXX - After having my father inform me that Wells Fargo had sent mail to his house at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Michigan - which is an address that should NEVER have been associated with my Wells Fargo account - I was able to call in and get my online access reset. Upon doing so, I saw the charge and the interest/late fees assessed from a fraudulent transaction that occurred AFTER the card was paid off and supposed to have been blocked. I file the first dispute ( I spoke with XXXX ), effectively cancelling the card number and having a new one sent to me - which I still have not received - and was told that the fees would be waived, the transaction removed, and everything is handled. I asked about credit bureaus and reporting to be made sure they're not effected and XXXX assured me of that. 

XX/XX/XXXX - I moved from XXXX to XXXX, Michigan and had already set up my forwarding address to new apartment. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Receive letter via mail that informed me my dispute was deemed "" completed '' because there was a credit on XX/XX/XXXX along with the charge. XXXX apparently misunderstood me and did NOT file the dispute with the correct charge - the charge done on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with XXXX to re-open the previous dispute and for them to correct the transaction in question ( the XX/XX/XXXX transaction ). XXXX also informed me that credit bureaus, the fees/interest, and charge will be corrected. 

XX/XX/XXXX - Receive statement to corrected address ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX . XXXX XXXX, MI XXXX ) that shows additional fees and the card/line being closed by Wells Fargo due to non-payment. I attempt to call their "" 24-Hour Customer Service '' phone number but they were closed ... 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX - I call Wells Fargo and speak with a representative who, upon pulling up my account profile, informed me that XXXX NEVER RESUBMITTED MY DISPUTE! After the representative "" helped '' me again ( as you could imagine, this now being the THIRD time trying to get a simple fraudulent transaction resolved I wasn't in the believing mood ) I wanted to speak to his superior. I was handed over to XXXX, one of the Executives of the Disputes Department, and she was the FIRST PERSON to give me a case number ( XXXX ) and a direct number to the executive office ; that phone number being ( XXXX ) XXXX. 

I logged into my XXXX XXXX XXXX  's Identity Alert protection service and saw that the incorrect reporting towards my credit report - due to XXXX not reopening my dispute case - dropped from the XXXX to XXXX. I filed a written dispute through Identity Alert with all three bureaus to get this resolved if/when Wells Fargo does not approve the dispute.

The reason that I wanted to file this is because I was told a lie by XXXX, and that nobody in this dispute department listened to a word I said from the very beginning. I was led astray by one of my financial institutions and it is something that will never happen again as upon this being resolved I will be closing out all accounts and never using Wells Fargo or any of it's predecessors for any future banking needs. This was an absolute misuse of my trust ; they told me only what I wanted to hear and not what in reality was happening or going to. This broke the fiduciary trust that I was looking forward to receiving due to having fraudulent charges show up on my account unexpectedly. I want to make sure that anybody and everybody understands that Wells Fargo is an abomination of a financial institution that does not care for their customers, both recently acquired and long-time relationships."
1585,"Requested a balance transfer from Wells Fargo, XXXX the bank is XXXX XXXX who says they have never received a transfer from Wells Fargo of any amount for this account. This started back in XX/XX/2019 continual communications with customer service by phone with always they were going to look in to it and get back with me but it never happened. Call to my house started with statements on how this was going to hurt my credit, it seemed like I was getting statements every 2 weeks showing the account was delinquent and the late charges kept building. I finally wrote them they responded to give them a couple of weeks and they would get back wit me, after 2 weeks they said they needed more time and after a while they came back with a number that was 15 letters long and said this was some sort of transfer number that proved it happened. 
I got with XXXX XXXX and they said the number meant nothing to them and only Wells Fargo new what it meant. Calls continued I wrote another letter got the same response and it is being reviewed. Mean well I got anther call I was passed to 4 people the last one was not available and was to get back with me but never did. They said that it was getting ready to be charged off and if I paid {$25.00} it would keep it active in this department told them paying anything would be admitting I was wrong. This was XX/XX/XXXX?"
1592,"First, on XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Wells Fargo using the toll free number provided in the billing sent via email to dispute the charges and to let them know that the old credit card I had ( XXXX XXXX was closed on my request with a XXXX balance. 
Secondly, I told the associate that I have not applied for nor have I received the credit card ; and, third and most importantly, I was not in the country when the card was sent and the charges were made. 

The associate from the Wells Fargo dispute center told me that someone from their office will contact me within seven days to let me know of the status of my dispute. Instead, the company sent me a letter stating that I have violated the card agreement and that I am responsible for the {$XXXX} charges, late fees and penalties. 

The outrageous claim that I violated the card agreement is that there were none to begin with since I have never applied for or received the card. 

The charges were made in early XXXX when I was actually working at the XXXX XXXX to the XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I left for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and did not return to XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. The charges were made at bars and cigar shops, places I never been in my life. 

Wells Fargo 's poor business practice has led to my credit scores plummeting from the high 700 to the mid 500s."
1593,"This is the second occasion in which I have noticed Wells Fargo charging exorbitant credit card fees above quoted rates. Previously, they have paid back fees without questions asked. If this is a pattern of behavior they are engaging in, in which they charge interest above what is quoted, they are stealing. I'm concerned this may be far-reaching. Many years ago even, I noticed they were charging interest on new purchases. I have taken pictures in this case of balances and charges. I could go to the company ( although they've made this difficult by not making it a disputable transaction ) but the behavior won't stop and a refund won't resolve this in this case, for me. They charged {$91.00} on a {$2200.00} credit card balance, an APR of approximately 50 %. These sorts of charges are predatory and hurt American consumers. Two photos are listed, one showing acct balance on XXXX, the other showing the interest charge on the same date. A third image is shared showing that the bank doesn't even list this as a disputable transaction. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter, XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX"

I also lost one of my main income sources. I contacted the bank this morning to discuss having it refunded. They were unable to due so. I simply do not agree with charging me a late fee during this unprecdented time. Is there any way we can have this fee absolved? Thanks for your consideration."

Even though there was nothing indicating that it was fraudulent. I am hoping this can get resolved. I have escalated this to the highest department at Wells Fargo, but since the COVID-19, I haven't been able to get a hold of anybody. I have a child and this is hindering my ability to do anything for him. I now have ZERO credit. : ("
1604,"I set up an open line of credit with Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX. After paying off the debt I called to close the account. I was informed that I could keep the account open with no penalty, hesitantly I decided to do so. In XX/XX/XXXX I began receiving notices of statements via email. I contacted Wells Fargo and closed the account. Or so I thought, I received yet another notice which indicated to me that the account had NOT been closed. I contacted them and found out that not only had it not been closed, but that I would have to pay {$120.00} fee for having it open ( {$25.00} annual fee ). I paid them. I was then told that I could not close my account for another day for the payment to post. Then I was told that due to a weird way that they had to process the payment it would instead be a week.

1628,"I was charged XXXX in interest fees in XXXX. I was also charged {$5500.00} in XXXX. 

All these interest were resulting directly from ( 14 ) disputed disputed transactions, and ALL interest was legally to be refunded / removed from the account. 

Wells Fargo did refund me the actual amounts of the 14 transactions in XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX, but none of the interest were removed except for a small {$310.00} interest credit. 

I have complained several time about it to no avail. last time XXXX responded to me in a letter that all interest were adjusted as shown on the statements between XXXX and XXXX XXXX but this is factually incorrect as the 14 credits I did receive on the account are only the original amounts of the 14 disputed transactions, but no interest were adjusted ( except for 1 credit of {$310.00} ). i latter spoke with Wells by phone, and after the rep realized he was wrong, all of a sudden he changed the excuse to say that i was not entitled to a refund for the interest credit because I never paid for the interest. that's also not true because the 14 disputed transaction credits were applied to pay off the entire outstanding balance which balance included the {$23000.00} interest that accumulated on the account since XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX."

1630,"On XX/XX/2019, Wells Fargo Bank issued a letter to close our personal credit card. The letter cited as their reason "" To manage risk .... '' and "" The decision to close your account is final and can not be changed. Our risk evaluation processes are proprietary and can not be shared. '' with full knowledge our payment history with Wells Fargo was excellent, FICO credit score of +800, and low debt to income ratios. We are responsible customers. 

This account closed was part of a larger conspiracy by Wells Fargo Bank to terminate our entire personal and business relationship after more than 25 years. The closed accounts even included our innocent children 's accounts. 

It is our belief this action taken by Wells Fargo Bank was the result of our small business, a insurance brokerage licensed by various Departments of Insurance with clients in the licensed medical and recreational cannabis industry. Essentially, they have adjudicated and concluded we have violated certain laws beyond our control as if they are judge and jury. Ironically, Wells Fargo Bank has its own well publicized history of actual illegal activity. 

We have direct knowledge, Wells Fargo Bank has not taken the same action of closing accounts with other licensed insurance entities with whom we conduct business and happen to bank with Wells Fargo. This is unfair to us. We believe they have discriminated and targeted against us as opposed to much larger and substantial companies and their employees who are conducting the exact same business. Why choose us as opposed to others? 

According to their letter "" Any unredeemed rewards points associated with this account have been forfeited. '' We have now been harmed and damaged since these rewards points we accumulated have now been essentially stolen by Wells Fargo Bank. 

Sadly to us, some of those rewards points were a special gift transferred to us from family member."

I reviewed ALL transactions, and they ALL showed that they have been posted to the account a minimum of 24 hrs prior. So, I made payment in full, which posted a couple days later. I happened to look back at my app and it showed a new balance of {$140.00}. When I called Wells they told me that it was still part of my charges that were posting. I asked why they had all shown posted to my account via my app a full 24 hours prior, why would I still have outstanding transactions. The response was that even though they show posted to my account, it takes 1-3 days to HARD POST. Three separate levels of reps told me this. I asked if the words HARD POST were explained or even present in my Cardmember Agreement, they said it was. Upon a search it was revealed to in fact not be in my agreement and any language could not be found around hard posting times. 

This is a deceptive practice, I was presented with a total balance, and confirmation that all transactions had posted, I made payment in full. Then a couple days later, without any further use of my card, I have a new balance. All this activity was well before any statement date, so if I had not done due diligence in checking my account again, I would have interest billed that I was not expecting or planning for. 

When I asked if they thought that was clear to the Customer, I received a canned answer that it is my responsibility to review my statement each time. If I paid my account in full, with all transactions showing posted, and did not use my card further, all before any cycle date, why would i need to review my statement!? As you read this, I hope you can understand my position and why this is totally deceptive. 

I filed a formal complaint with Wells CASE ID # XXXX"
1636,"On XX/XX/18 I applied for the Wells Fargo Platinum Visa with a {$3500.00} credit limit @ 0 % interest rater for 18 months. My credit rating upon application approval was @ XXXX and according the advertisement the interest rate would be based on credit worthiness and payment history and no higher than 24.49 % ( being the highest rate which should not apply to me based on my credit worthiness ) I have excellent credit / payment history with all my open accounts to include XXXX XXXX, XXXX & Wells Fargo. However I am being charged an interest rate of 24.99 % on a {$1300.00} balance when my minimum payment is {$43.00} HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE.. Please help"
1638,On XX/XX/2019 WF CRD SVC put lay payments on my account. This was an auto bill pay issue and the bank recognized this on their end because they closed the account then reopened it when disputed the issue with a sales rep over the phone. They sent me a letter saying they reopened the account but never removed the late payments that were associated with the same issue. It just popped p on the other bureaus and has greatly lowered my score.
1640,"I APPLIED WELLS FARGO XXXX XXXX XXXX ON XXXX. I GOT MY CREDIT CARD ON XXXX. I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE ON XXXX REGARDING THIS CREDIT CARD & I SPOKE TO XXXX XXXX ABOUT PROMOTION ON THIS ACCOUNT. THERE WAS A BONUS OF XXXX POINTS AFTER SPENDING {$1000.00} IN FIRST 3 MONTHS, WHEN I APPLY THIS CREDIT CARD. THERE IS NO BONUS ON MY NEW ACCOUNT ACCORDING TO CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT. & REWARD DEPT. XXXX XXXX. I THINK THIS A FRAUD THAT I DO NOT HAVE ANY BONUS ON THIS CREDIT CARD. I DO NOT TRUST THIS BANK. THIS BANK HAD A BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE & THEY LOST A CASE IN FED.

1641,"ON XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX treadmill, a floor mat, and assembly for {$1900.00} online on the XXXX website using my Wells Fargo visa card. The treadmill and mat was delivered and assembled without problem. Before I had run 50 miles ( roughly 7 runs ), the roller broke and the treadmill stopped working. I repeatedly called XXXX and was put on hold for long periods of time, as long as 1 hour and 20-30 mins waiting. After finally getting someone to answer, they did a video call with me and sent me what they guessed was the defective part. Their expectation was for me to fix their defective treadmill for them. After multiple attempts, I got the new part installed and was able to use the treadmill for a short period of time before it broke down again. After being put on hold for long periods of time again, I gave up and was resigned to the fact that I had been ripped off for {$1900.00}. However, that was only the beginning. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, a year after I had purchased the treadmill, a charge for more than {$400.00} that I had not made appeared on my credit card. I discovered the charge when another unauthorized charge appeared on my statement. I called Wells Fargo. They told me they would remove the charge and an investigator would be in touch. I had made no visits to XXXX website. I had not called to purchase any product or service. I had not authorized anyone to use that card for any purpose or any amount. 
I then received a new credit card from Wells Fargo, which I did not activate because I did not trust them after having allowed multiple unauthorized charges. And, access to my original account disappeared. I have no way to check dates of purchases because they eliminated my online access. I then received a form letter from Wells Fargo asking if I had made the charges. I immediately answered, again stating clearly that I did not make or authorize any charges in XXXX. I simply would not have authorized a company that had already ripped me off for {$1900.00} to make another charge, let alone one for over {$400.00}. No Wells Fargo investigator spoke with me. No one from Wells Fargo even bothered to ask me a single question about the authenticity of the charges. After a period of time, I received a bill from Wells Fargo for that unauthorized charge including interest. 

Wells Fargo allowed a predatory vender to use my credit card to make a transaction without my authorization. They acknowledged my report of unauthorized charges by sending me a new card and closing my original account. If they investigated, it was a sham investigation that did not involve all parties because no one spoke to me. I dont know if Wells Fargo is colluding with XXXX  in their predatory scheme to rip off consumers or if they simply side with large corporations in every dispute but I have been ripped off by XXXX  and Wells Fargo not only enabled them to get away with it but they are also trying to profit off of the scheme by charging me interest."
1645,"I opened a credit card with Wells Fargo to do a XXXX-interest balance transfer. The funds were never dispersed to the XXXX credit card specified in my credit application.

1647,"I am complaining and disputing all the enclosed Wells Fargo Bank miss-Information and/or non-truthful statements used to cover up this companys proven violations against the CLAIMANT XXXX XXXX rights which violated CFPA of 2010, OSHA Act Section 11 ( C ), civil rights, freedom of speech and other. Wells Fargo Bank N.A involved executives and/or decision makers closed my credit card account ending in XXXX in retaliation for my reporting of this companys violations and retaliation to CFPB, OCC and FDIC and FED.my account ending in XXXX always was paid on time with exceptional standing and it is paid off but no longer open against my will. Wells Fargo Bank spied on my Privacy and find out illegally about my XXXX normal transactions for advertising and making my legal case heard ..then closed my credit card ending in XXXX and as soon as I complained to a judge, to CFPB and others this bank opened fraudulently a new account ending in XXXX against my will, without my consent or request and there is no signed application for it neither a verbal consent of mine to open it. Wells Fargo alleged falsely that it was a replacement account to the account ending in XXXX that this bank closed in retaliation against my person. The fact is this bank is persistent in its unlawful efforts to cover up the huge and dangerous violations it committed against me including but not limited to opening an account under my private personal information again will without any consent from my person. 

Later on, This bank closed account XXXX strangely and opened it More strangely but for sure it was fraud and a criminal acts or adverse actions against my person. 


Attached as described little bit above is a lengthy file that represents Wells Fargo Bank N.A only and I rejected it and disputed it and complained about it with the explained narrative above. That file will be used against this company in a court of law. Sooner or later a huge legal price will be forced by law to reprimand this bank with its involved executives in the continuous retaliation against my person for my protected activities within CFPB, OCC and others. 


This Bank is still engaged in using enormous resources unlawfully in blacklisting, Blackmailing, retaliating and discriminating against me. 


They took from me everything material, financial and other valuable things. They caused me severe emotional distress, loss reputation, other illnesses and many other priceless damages and losses. 


They cant take away my dignity and I will fight them legally alone until I win. I will defeat them by a miracle, because it is obvious their violations and legal system prevails or by any other that is also legal and transparent unlike what they are baking* against me. 

I am open to negotiate a settlement. Recently I accepted their late sign up for a legal mediation within the government. When I met them in person they were just as I expected them : people without ethics, morale or values at all. They were wasting time to exhaust me more. But worse they used that to cause my case go in an inadvertent or unfair trajectory. They are afraid from normal proceedings because they have nothing to make but to trick the legal system in dirty* unethical manners used against a single person. Im just a simple citizen deprived from almost everything now and they are not serious to settle and they spent tens of thousands of dollars on greedy lawyers ( kick backs ... ) wasting my company funds and causing the company troubles. 

Those involved must await severe legal consequences and big surprises following role of law as always. Thank you All stated herein is to my current states belief, knowledge and understanding and it is al subject to anything or to any correction from unintentional errors at any time and by my person or my representative and without waiving my rights. 

- this company is still harassing and retaliating against my person despite my legal notices to them to stop and cease from those behaviors that violated the law.

They have made little effort to resolve this issue. I took the initiative to contact XXXX XXXX directly. After many attempts to reach XXXX XXXX, a representative responded. She gave me the information that the charge was for a gift card, the email of the person, and phone number of the person who made this fraudulent charge. Not only is stealing this amount of money a felony, if they use it to cross state borders it could be a federal crime. The person who made the fraudulent charge had my credit card information ( this card has since been cancelled ) and has my home address information.

1662,"Wells Fargo credit card bill due date is on the XXXX of every month. We had our bank, XXXX XXXX provides our checking/saving accounts ), remit payment on XX/XX/XXXX to arrive by XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to arrive by XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo claims payment not received until XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX respectively and charged late payment fee of {$38.00} in each instance. Call placed with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX to dispute late payment fee for XXXX as payment should have been received on time, and on XX/XX/XXXX to also dispute late payment fee for XXXX as well as an unidentified charge for "" minimum interest fee ''. 

Wells Fargo refused to refund fees, and was escalated to XXXX who also refused to take this action and case was escalated to their XXXX case team XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX. I question when this payment was actually received, and whether delay in processing on behalf of Wells Fargo contributed to late payment. Furthermore, I find it harder to believe that it would take longer than 7 business days for delivery of payment between XXXX and Wells Fargo. I believe this is a tactic on behalf of Wells Fargo to coerce consumers to leverage their own bill pay services instead. We were frequently encouraged to use the Wells Fargo bill pay services during our interactions with their customer service teams, and advised that bill should be paid in advance of due date instead XXXX which we did subsequent to this issue occurring in XXXX XXXX. 

To date, we have leveraged bill pay services with XXXX for over 15 years and this vendor is the only one that has had issues with payments not arriving on time. We find this hard to believe, and suspect that the issue is with Wells Fargo and their poor business practices. Furthermore, I question why Wells Fargo, a very large multi-branch bank, is unable to accept ACH transfers in lieu of a mailed check for making payments. ACH transfers would ensure that there is no discrepancy between when payment is remitted and when it is received. 

This is the second time we are complaining of this practice ( XXXX was our original complaint )."
1666,"On my Wells Fargo Credit card ending in XXXX I had a credit balance of {$200.00}. I requested the {$200.00} balance be refunded to me either by check or transfer to my wells checking account. Wells fargo processed the refund of the amount owed to me to my checking account, but then charged me {$10.00} to refund the balance due to me. This was not a cash advance, this was a refund. I requested the {$10.00} fee they charged me to be credited, they stated they would credit the fee, then never did. 

From : Customer Service Sent : XX/XX/2019 XXXX XXXX  Subject : Re : RE : Re : RE : Re : Account questions or requests (  XXXX ) Dear XXXX XXXX : Thank you for contacting Wells Fargo. My name is XXXX, and I appreciate the opportunity to respond to your email. 

I would like to assure you that your concerns have been escalated to the highest level of email. 

I understand your concerns regarding the {$10.00} cash advance transaction finance charge posted on XX/XX/2019 for a cash advance to the checking account ending in XXXX. 

Because you are a valued customer, I credited your account in the amount of {$10.00}. A credit will appear on your account."
1667,"On XX/XX/2018, I called Wells Fargo Dispute Department, in an effort to collect a retainer fee paid by me on XX/XX/2018 for {$2500.00} to XXXX XXXX, XXXX, for writing a Trust Document. I was then contacted by XXXX XXXX, Wells Fargo Claims Assistant Center. He asked me to provide as much information as possible, including copies of the Trust, my Will, etc., and an explanation for the complaint. 

On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I sent to WF emails detailing the complaint, the Trust and Will and all email correspondence between the attorney and myself as proof that I had contacted the attorney on may occasions trying to get back the retainer for the unsatisfactory work performed ( it was a boilerplate document which resulted in many irrelevant information, typographical errors, errors describing my marital status, etc ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received "" Cardholder Statement of Disputed Transactions '' from WF, I faxed it to them from a WF Branch on the same date. This from was pre-filled by them with the date of complaint and amount of complaint.

I called WF on XX/XX/XXXX, and based on the system notes read to me by an employee, it was evident that Mr.XXXX did not understand the nature of the complaint. I sent an email, again detailing the complaint and asked the person on the phone to ask Mr. XXXX to call me. Never did. 

I made several calls to the WF to determine the status of the claim and asking to speak to Mr. XXXX. He never called me. 

I never received the required provisional credit within 10 days of the complaint. As a matter of fact, I was never given any provisional credit. The {$2500.00} remained as part of my credit card balance until XX/XX/XXXX ( which I will explain below ). In the meantime before making my credit card payment ( twice since the complaint ) I have contacted WF to ensure that no finance charges will be assessed on my account since the {$2500.00} was still shown on my balance as part of the balance due. They assured me no finance charge will be assessed and they were correct. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, {$2500.00} was credited to my credit card without any explanation as to whether this was the provisional credit that should have posted to the account back in early XXXX, or final credit. I took it to mean it was FINAL CREDIT due to the time transpired. No explanation whatsoever has been provided. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Mr. XXXX stating that my complaint, with the same complaint # XXXX for {$2500.00} was RE-OPEN. As far as I knew he had been working on my complaint since XX/XX/XXXX and I NEVER CLOSED NOR WAS I NOTIFIED THAT THIS COMPLAINT WAS CLOSED. I also got a form letter in the mail dated XX/XX/XXXX telling me that my account was charged {$16.00} due to a processing error incorrectly refunded to me on XX/XX/XXXX, this letter also referenced {$2500.00} as charges. The processing error was Mr. XXXX having erroneously worked on a charge posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX, that was NEVER part of the complaint. 

I called WF immediately, and after asking them what will it take for them to do things right, if I needed to reach out to the CFPB. Immediately they transferred me to a person by the name of XXXX in Executive Office ( she said they do not give last name, whom I was not able to reach again ). I explained the frustration and pointed out all their error in not following Regulation E. I also told her that under no circumstance is Mr. XXXX to proceed working on my case. 

I realized then, and it was confirmed by XXXX, that Mr. XXXX, in spite of all the documents provided by me, all the follow-up phone calls, his early correspondence noting the {$2500.00}, in addition to all the notes on WF Complain System, he had worked on the {$16.00} charge to my account which posted also XX/XX/XXXX, which was NEVER an issue NOR he had any authority from me. As a matter of fact the person who I paid the {$16.00} called asking me why I was disputing that charge, very embarrasing. That is how I became aware of that. I immediately called WF to ensure that they only work on my CLAIM of {$2500.00}. I contacted the other person that I had made a payment which also posted on XX/XX/XXXX advising them just in case WF contacted them saying that I was disputing those charges as well. I have had to work very hard on this claim due to all WF 's errors. Please keep in mind that I have made two payments to my credit card since the claim was file, and no finance charge was assessed, therefore, the system was correctly reflecting the dispute. The only one that did not know was the case worker. 

I asked XXXX that I wanted to know how something as ludicrous as this could have happened. Where does the responsibility lie. This has timing issues since by then my attorney probably figured that I will not dispute the charges. For an employee to just decide to work on a charge that was never disputed and disregard all the documents submitted by me, in addition to their own documents and system notes is embarrassing for this institution. 

I have never encountered this level of incompetency and negligence from any bank employee before. Mr. XXXX has shown a total disregard of his responsibilities and his lack of training is evident.How can he work with sensitive information. Also, what has happened to all the documents I provided him/WF with?. What role, if any does a supervisor/management plays in all of this? 

In the meantime, I am asking you to please take action to see if I can recoup my {$2500.00}. By now it has taken so long that I hope WF did not jeopardize my chances of getting my money back, due to their negligence. I am a senior citizen on a fix income and I do take this problem very seriously.

It has been very frustrating and difficult dealing with WF, compounded by the fact that they do not follow the required regulation. This is unacceptable. 

I was told that a person named XXXX has now been assigned my case. 

Thank you very much for assisting me."
1670,"I am trying to use the Cell Phone protection benefits on my cards. I have submitted the required form and all documents to the company ( Wells Fargo ) via email twice, and have not received any status updates despite continued efforts to contact them. I called them and was told they would be in touch with me but they never got back in touch with me. This has been ongoing for several weeks. The claim was initiated on XX/XX/2018 and I last heard from them on XXXX XX/XX/2018. The amount is {$600.00}, the maximum amount covered in this insurance."
1675,When I cancelled my account I had rewards dollars in the amount of {$110.00}. I asked how to redeem these and was told the easiest way was to just subtract them from my final balance. When I received my final statement of {$180.00} the amount owed was not adjusted for my rewards money. I reduced the amount by {$110.00} and sent them a check for the balance of {$70.00} and considered the matter closed on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. I also printed a disclosure on the back of my check stating that if the check was cashed my account will be considered paid in full. The check was deposited. When I contacted them about this in XXXX I was told that the employee should not have told me that it would be reduced.I now have received a notice that I owe them {$140.00} including a late fee of {$25.00}. I feel I do not owe them anything and want a letter from this company accepting responsibility for this matter and they consider the balance paid.
1676,"On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX - I made a furniture purchase at our local furniture store. I requested a credit limit increase with Wells Fargo Home Furnishing Credit Program, an account that I have had open for many years. The credit limit was increased as requested, however not for the amount of the purchase. In good faith I paid the difference in cash. However, I opted to contact Wells Fargo on Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX to request reconsideration of the credit limit increase to prevent the card from being at 100 % utilization. Wells Fargo advised me that the only way to request a reconsideration was to repull my credit report. The representative also steered me to believe that I needed to state additional income of my spouse on the application for reconsideration in order to be a approved. Being that I needed the reconsideration and was under the impression that the additional income would help the outcome, I approved Wells Fargo to repull credit. I was advised to follow up 30 minutes later. When I followed up 30 minutes later, I was told that I was declined and they were unable to advise me a ) of the decline reasons b ) if they repulled my credit a second time. I requested to speak with a manager and they were unable to answer either question ; however shared that I may request a 3rd reconsideration if I permitted a 3rd repull of my credit report. I then notified them I was reporting Wells Fargo to the CFPB and was sent to an Executive Escalation contact who was unable to assist with my reconsideration request or provide any insight as to the reasons for the decline of credit. 
I feel this is not only predatory by requesting a 2nd and 3rd credit report but also that I was targeted and steered to list additional unnecessary income when my DTI is less than 20 % of my total income for a credit card. It is not acceptable for any financial institution to repull credit arbitrarily and impact FICO scores for up to 2 years. I feel that I was mislead, taken advantage of and given no explanation for the decision and hope that I have recourse in this situation."

I never MISSED a payment and the payments were not MORE than 30-days late -- the criteria for reporting a late payment to the credit bureaus. My credit score was on the mend when suddenly, they decreased my max limit, reported that decrease to the bureau, and it caused my credit score to plummet. This was completely unilaterally without a single communication - no phone call, no letter ... nothing. No chance for me to respond, explain or discuss with a human being."
1682,"Event occurred today, XX/XX/2019 at about XXXX. My wife and I were sitting in our home with representative of flooring company ( XXXX ) completing credit application. I received an email from Well Fargo Bank of a Credit Card Agreement. The agreement did not include my name but noted it was a Terms of Agreement. I had not signed any agreement nor applied for credit card from Wells Fargo. A few moments later I received a call from a WF agent stating I needed to provide personal information ( DOB, last four of SSN ). I refused to provide information and was told I would need to call WF later if I wanted  to proceed.

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX Nevada ) told me that my rewards will not be at 5 % ( only for 6 months a fact concealed nicely ). She also told me that reward points will expire on XX/XX/XXXX. This came as a shock since WF did not state this during the application process. I then asked her to send me a check of the remaining reward points ( balance about {$20.00} ) and then cancel the card. She refused to do that since the reward balance is less than 25 can not be given. I stated that this is a special case in that WF lied to trap me, or at least withheld important information. Further, she told me that cancelling the card will forfeit all the reward pints. She then said that someone from the executive office will call. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX called but refused to release my reward points ( ref : XXXX ). 

This is not fair nor it is legal to deceive customers by perpetual cajoling to get their card and then not pay the reward legally earned. It appears that WF is still involved in unethical and shameful practices. Dishonesty is deeply ingrained in WFs culture. We are helpless senior citizens and ask you to assist us in this matter. All we are asking is to get our earned rewards.

Well this year I called again and had it raised to corporate level where I was told probly history of my account was bad, this is a lie I always pay this and every other account on time and usally pay more than the minimum payment. Ichecked my credit report and my score is in the high six hundreds and I have unsecured accounts, they are just giving me the run around and will not furnish exact proof why I can not get an unsecured card with them. I spoke to XXXX in corporate office and was told there was nothing he could do.

1691,"My complaint is the manner in which Wells Fargo responded to my dispute. It took 7 months. Months of calling and emailing to try to understand what had gone wrong with my account. 
And I believe that is also took me reporting it to you for them to ever reach out to me. 
They say now as of XX/XX/XXXX the dispute has been resolved and have shown where they credited my account for 2 payments of equal amounts and how one was returned and the ADDED back onto my balance. 
This threw me off completely and I did not understand. After months of trying to get someone to help me months and months later, they are saying I owe interest charges that I would have paid as I always paid my balance in full every month. I was not going to pay Wells Fargo for an amount that I did not think was accurate and expect a refund from them when I can not even get anyone to help me answer questions. 
I indicated this to the case manager that responded to me only after I reported Wells Fargo to you. I told them that I can not pay the entire amount until things were verified and agreed and understood. It did not matter to Wells Fargo because why would they want to settle my dispute in a timely manner they never gave that consideration. They would be happy if it never got resolved and my interest and balance just kept increasing so they can make more money off of me. 
I can not believe how inadequate, unprofessional, and downright deceitful Wells Fargo has been. Even after years and years of being a customer with them, paying my balance in full and on time every month. 
I noticed some discrepancies with my account in XXXX of 2020 ( literally 7 months ago ) and I had a case created that was NEVER followed up on. 
I called routinely every week ( just to torture myself ), which caused severe amounts of stress for me but it was important for me to understand and resolve my questions concerning my balance. 

No one ever helped me. I would be told that a case manager had to be assigned and they would contact me. Then on one occasion in XXXX when the balance was still in question I received an email from a case manager introducing themselves to me. I responded and NEVER heard back from them. Finally, after I reported Wells Fargo to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau someone magically contacted me. 



I received a resolution letter from Wells Fargo Executive offices on XX/XX/2020, through email. I still do not agree with the resolution. 
It took Wells Fargo 7 months, hundreds of phone calls, many emails, and so much aggravation to try to get to the bottom of an issue. 
I have always had my BALANCE in dispute. I did not agree with the validity and accuracy of the amount. 
The resolution letter states that my balance is We confirm that as of the date of this letter, your account has a balance of {$14000.00}. 
I made a phone payment on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX for {$500.00} with a confirmation number XXXX On XXXX  after I spent over an hour on the phone with Wells Fargo before work to go to my bank and get a cashiers check for my remaining balance. If I did not do something, my account would keep on accruing interest which is what I am disputing. 
I sent Wells Fargo a cashiers check from my bank for {$13.00}, XXXX. The amount they quoted me in the letter and from the automated response when I dial in to Wells Fargo ( the amounts matched and were the same ) minus the {$500.00} pa I noticed some discrepancies with my account inyment I made over the phone that I indicated above. XXXX of 2020 ( literally 7 months ago ) and I had a case created that was NEVER followed up on. 
I called routinely every week ( just to XXXX  myself ), which caused severe amounts of stress for me but it was important for me to understand and resolve my questions concerning my balance. 

No one ever helped me. I would be told that a case manager had to be assigned and they would contact me. Then on one occasion in XXXX when the balance was still in question I received an email from a case manager introducing themselves to me. I responded and NEVER heard back from them. Finally, after I reported Wells Fargo to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau someone magically contacted me. 

Wells Fargo wants to charge me almost {$300.00} worth of interest that I called this morning about to have waived and they said they could not do that. 
They did credit my account for some fees but these are what I am questioning. They never responded, only responded after I took it to another level and all the while I am questioning my balance they just sit there, never return my emails or calls or help me and let my account go on accruing interest. It is their fault. I should not have to pay for these. And I should not have to pay ANYMORE money as I have given them their total amount that was indicated on the resolution letter. 

In my resolution letter, my balance is indicated. Also when I call the automated phone system that balance is confirmed by what is in the letter. 

Today I went to my bank to get a cashiers check for the total balance including the almost {$300.00} in question of interest charges that I am requesting them to waive. 
I went to 3 Wells Fargo banks and finally found one that would actually communicate with me. 
One branch ( XXXX in XXXX XXXX ) was open drive-thru only and I called the number to try to get in to talk to someone, a banker -- anyone..no one would answer the phone. 
I went to another branch ( XXXX and XXXX XXXX ) and the same thing occurred there. 
Luckily, the Wells Fargo at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was open. I was able to walk in and pay my cashiers check and receive a confirmation receipt for that very large payment. 
I want to be completely finished with Wells Fargo as they have caused me XXXX, financial and emotional  distress. They clearly have no intention of providing satisfactory customer service. 

There has been as of this morning after spending another hour or so on the phone with them been another case created. 
This case number is XXXX The previous case numbers were XXXX and XXXX As you can see by the first 4 digits they indicate the month they were initiated. Also included was the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau case number : XXXX -- Which I have indicated is the only reason Wells Fargo contacted me when I did because I took this step in contacting you to try to get some help after receiving nothing from Wells Fargo for 7 months. 
The bottom line is that this entire balance was in question -- -I could not pay it off in full until I understood if it was accurate -- -I still do not believe it is accurate but I have sent them PAYOFF in FULL even including these finance charges I am in dispute of. 
It has been my experience that Wells Fargo has a 10 day window which every time I called I was told that they had asked for an extension because no case manager had taken my case yet. 
I assume this will be the case once again and the miscommunication will only get worse if not remain the awful same that I have received from them. 
Please if you can on my behalf argue that these finance/interest charges should not be on my account when the account was in dispute -- I have paid a very large some of money to Wells Fargo to be finished with this company for good. I have no money left to give them. 
My balance needs to be {$0.00}. 
Please help me with this. I am sorry if things have been repeated in this letter-I tried to be concise and include all pertinent information."

1702,"I had a XXXX XXXX Credit Card with Wells Fargo Bank that was closed by Wells Fargo without notice. The account was opened in XX/XX/2016  and never had a balance because it is a credit card that is used for medical expenses. Fortunately, I did not need to use it. When I went on the Wells Fargo website to pay my mortgage and other Wells Fargo Credit cards I noticed that the XXXX XXXX was closed. I never received any e-mail, letter or alerts that the account was pending closure. I called up and asked why the account was closed and WF informed me it was closed due to inactivity. I asked why I was not notified and was told someone would contact me in a few days. About a week later I received a letter stating that they do not notify the customer if the account is closed and I would need to go to XXXX XXXX if I wanted to reopen the account. I do not want a new inquiry on my credit report and do not want to have an account showing as closed by the creditor. If I had known the bank was planning on closing the account I would have paid a doctor bill with it to keep it open. I would like this account reopened and I will make a payment to my doctor when I get my annual physical."
1703,They force me to change my password repeatedly and wont allow me to use my own password. Refuse to help and suspend my access online.
1704,"In XX/XX/XXXX, charges were made to my account number in the amount of {$580.00} which I told Wells Fargo were fraudulent. They asserted otherwise. On XX/XX/XXXX after I asserted otherwise they credited {$580.00} back to my new account as they found that the charges were made without my permission. Since that time I have not received any further statement from them they I owe this amount. In XX/XX/XXXX, a trip we had paid for was canceled and the trip provider, XXXX refunded {$3600.00} to the card I charged it on which was my old account number. Wells Fargo only remitted {$3000.00} back to me. The total refund was {$3600.00}. Apparently they applied {$580.00} to the fraudulent charges which they had previously refunded to me. I asked them to give me the entire refund which they refused to do. If they feel I still owe them the {$580.00} which were fraudulent why have they not billed me for that amount and why did they refund them? I feel they owe me {$580.00}. I would like my money back. They were very uncooperative."
1705,"Wells Fargo letter from XXXX He stated that the supervisor 's phone call was not recorded. That is a lie. I have the original and it was recorded by Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX. You can plainly hear him state that the call is being recorded. If XXXX lies about such a small detail as this, he is inclined to lie about most anything. As a lawyer, juries do not like people whom are caught not telling the truth, they can in part or in part dismiss the whole statement made by the person. Also he stated that there was miscommunication between the executive and myself. XXXX here is the miscommunication. Misaligned Vocabularies Plain language refers to the preference for words that are in everyones vocabulary what linguists term the core vocabulary consisting of about 200 to 300 words. These words are mostly verbs, pronouns, and demonstratives, such as his and that, which help distinguish the subject the speaker or writer is referring to. These words are used frequently and across many contexts to express meaning and intent, usually without misunderstanding. 

As the initiator of communication, the speaker or writer must choose words that are easily understood by the listener or reader. For example, a 10-year-old is unlikely to understand the meaning of plethora, so plenty or a lot would be better choices. A communicator should always consider his or her audience when communicating. 

2. Messy Thinking Messy thinking results in messy  speaking, which usually occurs when someone begins speaking before completing his or her thought process. As a consequence, listeners are taken on long, convoluted journeys filled with contradictions, extraneous information, and premature conclusions. 

Messy thinking usually happens during periods of stress or high emotion. Remember Platos observation : Wise men speak because they have something to say, while fools speak because they have to say something. In other words, think about the intent of your message before speaking, and when speaking, choose language that is precise, clear, and easily understood.

3. Faulty Definitions Homophones are words that sound alike or nearly alike, but have different definitions. For example, discreet means careful and circumspect, while discrete means distinct or separate. 

Other examples include : abhorrent aberrant alternate alternative disassemble dissemble emigrate immigrate flounder founder horde hoard Your choice of words is important because the wrong word can confuse the listener or reader. When in doubt, consult a dictionary or simply dont use the word.

4. False Civility While civility is a desirable trait in all societies, its often misunderstood and misinterpreted. Civility is a matter of context what might be considered rude or thoughtless in one situation could be proper in another. A parent warning a child to get out of the street shouldnt value the childs feelings over his or her safety ; a supervisor disciplining a subordinate for poor results shouldnt dilute or confuse the message in the hopes of being perceived as nice. Civility means being conscious and considerate of how actions and words affect others, but it does not mean beating around the bush or faking emotions.

5. Sloppy Language Habits Unconscious patterns of thinking, speaking, and interacting are developed over time. These habits affect your daily activities and your relationship with your environment. They surface in speaking and writing, and they often lead to miscommunication. 

Be careful when you use the following : Acronyms. Acronyms are abbreviated versions of phrases or organization names that are formed by combining alphabetical characters to create a new word, such as OSHA shorthand for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration of the Federal Government. Acronyms save time and may improve recall of the underlying meaning. Unfortunately, acronyms are so ubiquitous in speech and print that their meanings are often misinterpreted. For example, the meaning of the acronym ACA could be correctly interpreted as Affordable Care Act, American Correctional Association, American Camp Association, or American Chiropractic Association. If you use an acronym, be sure to provide its meaning so your audience is not confused. 
Jargon and Colloquialisms. Many social, business, or professional groups develop special vocabularies to describe concepts and activities specific to their group XXXX jargon ). Examples include baluster in architecture, arabesque in ballet, and all in in poker. Colloquialisms are phrases and words from specific geographic regions typically used in conversation, but not formal writing. The meaning of pot liquor, a term used to describe the juices left in a pot after cooking peas or collard greens, would be readily understood in the South, but less so above the Mason-Dixon line. Jargon and colloquialisms can add color to speech and writing, even enhancing understanding where their meanings are understood, but the possibility of misunderstanding remains high. 
Assumptions, Stereotypes, and Allusions. Its well known that the use of assumptions taking something for granted or without proof can make you look bad. Stereotypes ( inaccurate simplistic generalizations ) and allusions ( indirect, often incorrect references ) can have the same result : muddying your intended message and confusing listeners or readers. There is little to gain from their use and much to lose, so avoid them whenever possible. 
Buzzwords. Words that sound impressive but convey no special meaning are in a special class by themselves. They have no place in intelligent speech or writing. Use of buzzwords is so flagrant that drinking games are built on their use in political speeches. However, politicians are not the only guilty parties some corporate cultures are infamous for their use. XXXX XXXX, the creator of The XXXX XXXX, even suggests that employees learn to use big, vague words as they progress up through management, preferring a sentence such as I utilized my multi-tined tool to process a starch resource to I used my fork to eat a potato. 
6. Government-Speak and Legalese Legal and regulatory documents are especially open to confusion due to both their use of technical terms and a culture that often rewards quantity of words over quality and intent. According to XXXX writer XXXX XXXX, Hard-to-understand rules are a lawyers best friend, and the need for companies to lawyer up is a huge [ competitive ] advantage to large or established entities. 

Poorly written government documents ultimately led to the passage of the Plain Writing Act of 2010, and the establishment of a public plain language website, PlainLanguage.gov, to promote the use of plain language for all government communications. As you might expect, the need for improved written communication extends beyond the American borders and even the English language. There are organizations around the world that are dedicated to improving government document understanding through the use of plain language : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX in XXXX, and XXXX! in XXXX. 



How does this apply to that situation? It does not. Listen to the tapes of the conversation. I asked her not once but many times if the card was still open and see stated yes. It is not miscommunication- it is a screw up and human error. Call it like it is?"
1708,"I feel like I am being penalized or retaliated against by Wells Fargo since I had complaint about the original checking/credit account opening beginning in XX/XX/2021. As recent as XX/XX/2021, my credit monitoring alerts indicated WF  again has another checking/credit open under my identity. They closed one and attempted to open another.

In addition, the WF fraud department sent me a slew of documents dated on XX/XX/2021 to be NOTARIZED by me or they threaten to leave the accounts open and will assume it was made in good faith. Why don't they make the person who is trying to open the account notarize the application? Why do I have to pay for a notary service to stop them from opening fraudulent accounts. Keep in mind that I had already put a fraud alert and froze all of my credit reports. The letter also stated that they could not reach me by phone, but I had called them several times regarding the fraudulent accounts. 

Called them XX/XX/2021 with Claim # XXXX, other case # given XXXX and two more times after this. 

I even went into a local branch ( XXXX XXXX nmls : XXXX ) so they can verify my identity : XXXX I had filed an earlier case that was closed on XX/XX/2021 and was referred to WF Fraud department.

It's mind boggling. 

I attached the letter from WF fraud department stating that I must notarize my identity otherwise they will assume I had authorized the credit card application. I also attached my monitoring alerts showing WF is again opening credit/checking account in my name fraudulently. This is blatant fraud and blackmailing."
1714,"I have two WELLS FARGO store accounts and they are incorrectly reporting that I have disputed the accounts which I HAVE NOT. The credit bureaus are telling me that every time they remove the incorrect remark from my credit report that Wells Fargo reports it again each month when they report my payments. This is absurd and this needs to stop. Wells Fargo has been found guilty of creating fake accounts, they have been found guilty of costing people a mortgage and now they are making false, unverifiable statements on my credit reports each month. I am attaching a copy of the credit report remarks as proof as well as a scanned copy of the two account cards that are verification of the accounts in question. I simply want the remarks to be removed from my account permanently and for them to not put them back on my account when they report each month. 

If they do not want to honor my request then I will have the State Attorney General to step in and investigate and I will have no choice but to sue them. This is disgraceful that they would do this to me each month and I want it to stop.

1723,"Unfortunately, I have had several bad experiences with Wells Fargo. After allowing multiple opportunities to correct their mistakes I have decided to forewarn everyone to move cautiously when considering a business relationship with Wells Fargo and submit a formal complaint. As a small business owner customer service drives revenue for our company. 
My initial encounter with Wells Fargo was onXX/XX/XXXX, I opened the business checking account. Everything seemed to go well until I was unable to login to the account. After several attempts to login I changed the password. Little did I know, the account was linked to someone else account. Fortunately, it was my wife but I was never joint to her account so one can only conclude that the banker responsible for establishing a new account added me to her profile without her authorization. After bringing it to their attention the manager apologized and corrected the error and convinced me that the service is great and would like an opportunity to assist me by opening a business credit card ... I obliged. 
Hindsight is 20-20 because on XX/XX/XXXX following that experience our clients were making orders and mailing checks but Wells Fargo would place a hold of 10 days on the check prior to releasing the funds ( this hindered the day-to-day operations of running the firm ). Although it seemed to correct itself, I had a recent encounter with this "" glitch '' again onXX/XX/XXXX. 
My final straw was onXX/XX/XXXX without notification, the same business credit card which managed all of the rolling transactions, its credit limit was reduced by nearly 70 % then charged an over-the-limit fee. This was clearly a mistake so I went into the branch which the banker expressed that she didn't know why and contacted the business credit card department. The account was closed all occurring within 1 billing cycle. The representative apologized for the mistake and said he sent an email to the supervisor for follow up to reopen the account. After a few months of silence, XX/XX/XXXX I called customer service which then explained that its been over 90 days since the closing of the account and there's no further action that can be taken. 
In conclusion, in order to avoid loss of time, energy and resources one should consider establishing a business relationship with a financial institution that will not put your privacy, credit and finances at risk. AVOID WELLS FARGO!!"

1751,"Hello, The office of the comptroller has referred my complaint to your group. Wells Fargo has engage in extremely misleading practices and should be penalized. I am attempting to file a formal complaint against Wells Fargo for deceptive practices. I have scans of the written correspondence between them and I that can be provided. My email address is XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I logged into my wells account to look at the credit card bill. At this time, I was presented with a popup notification while logged into the credit card account. This popup was viewed by myself and my wife, XXXX XXXX. She can be contacted at XXXX XXXX XXXX. This popup very clearly offered a settlement of our credit card balance. The offer was not ambiguous. It offered a settlement for our outstanding credit card balance. 
The offer was time sensitive and had to be responded to that day. If I agreed to the offer, I would pay XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and two weeks later, I would be asked to pay XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. This offer clearly said settlement. The offer referenced the entire outstanding balance. Each of the payments that encompassed the settlement WAS LARGER THAN THE MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE AT THAT TIME. My wife and I debated this offer and agreed to accept it. It was a painful choice and enormously difficult for my wife and I. {$2300.00} for us meant forgoing other payments in order to settle this one card. We decided it was too valuable and we could not refuse. This would reduce our debt significantly and we agreed to the offer. I made the payment and two weeks later, made the second payment as requested. In XXXX, I received a statement showing we still had an outstanding balance with Wells Fargo. This, I attributed to slow reporting of the settlement as it processed through their systems. On XX/XX/XXXX, I checked the account status. It showed no change, so my wife called the bank. The call center employees then proceeded to give multiple versions of what the payments I had remitted were for and denied they offered a settlement. 
We requested escalation. I hope they recorded these calls as my wife shot down all their illogical claims about why we were paying XXXX we didn't have when we didn't owe that much at the time.

His letter is dated XX/XX/XXXX. I then logged into the account, took screenshots of the payments and dates from my wells checking in order to preserve the records. I then mailed them a very clear, written complaint with the screenshots and correct order of events regarding their settlement offer. I formally requested they retain all documents relating and communications related to this matter. I also requested they provide the DIGITAL REPRESENTATION that was presented to me via their website. Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX then mailed me a letter that described their verbiage as'you 've been approved for a payment arrangement on your total amount due of XXXX you may make two payments by the following dates : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX '' It goes on but their second paragraph acknowledges WE ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE A SCREEN CAPTURE OF YOUR SPECIFIC ONLINE SESSION, however, the verbiage above is what was presented to you. We can also confirm there was no offer of a settlement. This is a complete misrepresentation, complete falsehood, based on no facts in their possession. The company has refused to provide us the actual offer that we received. Their offer, our acceptance, and the compensation we sent them should constitute an enforceable contract. This is not what their popup offer showed, not even close. Wells refuses to provide or review the actual offer we accepted. We suffered blows to our credit by forgoing other bills to accept their settlement. This is absolutely unacceptable.. We received a digital offer of settlement, we accepted it, we relied on their offer, to our detriment, we provided consideration. Please fine these lying thieves into the stone age and force them to honor their crystal clear settlement offer to my wife and I. Thank you."
1755,"I provide consulting services and get paid via credit card. 
Before I accepted the payments, I called my credit card issuers and asked them what is the safest way to get paid and not worry about fraud, as in the past when I got paid by checks, the checks bounced. 
So I wasclearly instructed not to give any card or banking information. 
I was told to take the company banking info for payment with a written authorisation to process the payments. 
I followed the instructions step by step, received the payments, and four and an half months later the credit card companies ( 3 of them ) say that the payments were reversed and that I have to pay back the balance, as it is not their problem to collect the original funds. 
I called many times and attempted to explain that there is a written authorisation for the mentioned transaction, and that I followed their instructions on payment but they refuse to help and now my credit is getting badly hit. 
I don't know what else to do. Thank you for your attention to this matter"
1756,"I have a prepaid rewards card where the funds don't expire where I am trying to figure out the balance. I've contacted the company multiple times about this and requested a response in writing. No of the information has been helpful. The company claims they can not find information regarding the card. Photos of the card are attached. 
Additionally, the company claims they have confirmed the with their customer service team and I may visit their website, myprepaidsolution.com, to register the card. Once registered, I will be able to review any remaining account balances, as the verified funds no not expire. Any remaining balances can be arranged to be issued to me in the form of a cashier 's check sent to my mailing address. 
This is an issue with this claim. This card has been registered for months on the website given. If the website would give the balance there wouldn't be a need for me to contact the company. So the statement that they will see the balance there when it is register is simply incorrect and a blatant lie. I've attached a screenshot from my account at that website to show where it will not show any balance. 
I simply want the money from my card where the funds DO NOT EXPIRE and this company will not grant these to me. This company is stealing money from me. How many other customers is this company taking advantage of and stealing from by not telling them their balances and giving them their money? 
The company claims they have exhausted all options to resolve this issue. Pretty convenient for them to exhaust all options when they can just steal the money. I've provided all the information for this issue to be resolved by the company. The company is just not doing anything to resolve the issue and claiming they have done everything. Maybe, just maybe, they don't want to do anything because they can just keep this money from customers if they claim they have done all they can."

Due to a mistake at the register I did not receive credit at the register for the pair that I returned. I called the store when I discovered the mistake. The store manager, XXXX at Mall XXXX XXXX in XXXX, KY performed a store audit and found the mistake. She promised me a credit to my store credit card for the dress pants. Several months passed and the credit card company Wells Fargo refuses to refund my monies stating that there is no receipt for the transaction. Of course, there is not a receipt. The mistake was made at the register. Wells Fargo must go back to the store audit and the store manager to find the mistake and acknowledge it. XXXX refuses to speak to Wells Fargo and Wells Fargo refuses to speak to XXXX. Of course, I don't have a receipt. I knew this the moment I realized there was a problem on XX/XX/XXXX. That's why the store audit was conducted and the mistake acknowledge by the store. Well 's Fargo refusing to communicated with the store on this point is equivalent to theft. I have received no less than three letters telling me I do not have a receipt. This is silly and wrong. I can provide copies of the letters, but I can not provide copies of a receipt when the mistake was made at the register. The store audit should be proof enough."

Wells Fargo claims payment not received until XX/XX/2020 and charged late payment fee of {$38.00}. 
Call placed with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2020 to dispute late payment fee, as payment should have been received on time. Wells Fargo refused to refund fee, and was escalated to manager who also refused to take this action.

We question when this payment was actually received, and whether delay in processing on behalf of Wells Fargo contributed to late payment. Furthermore, we find it hard to believe that it would take longer than 6 business days for delivery of payment between XXXX and Wells Fargo. We believe this is a tactic on behalf of Wells Fargo to encourage consumers to leverage their own bill pay services instead. This was evidenced by the fact that Wells Fargo manager encouraged use of their own services, and advised that bill should be paid in advance of due date instead. 
To date, we have leveraged bill pay services with XXXX for over 15 years and this is the first instance of a payment not arriving on time. We find this hard to believe, and suspect that the issue is with Wells Fargo and their poor business practices."

1788,"Greetings, I have had a Wells Fargo credit card since XX/XX/XXXX. I have never missed a payment. When I opened this account my interest was a little less than 15 %. Now it is 19.8 %!!!! 

I just found this out because my interest charge keeps going up even though I am paying the principle down and started making inquiries. 

During my last couple years in college, I did escalate the principle. In XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the XXXX, Colorado Wells Fargo bank seeking to refinance. I was told then that my interests rate on the card was around 15 %. Based on this I decided not to refinance. However, in my recent conversation with a Wells Fargo executive, they said my interest rates have always been nearly 20 % since XX/XX/XXXX!!!!! They claimed the bank in XXXX, must have looked a wrong information. That does not pass the smell test. I have no idea how long I have been being ripped off by Wells Fargo. 

I make two payments even month when I get paid, so I am always two weeks ahead of the due date, which is at the endow the month. However, their computer and data entry is not keeping up with my payment history, often showing I owe a payment even though I have already met my monthly obligation well in advance. 

Also, I used the card back in XX/XX/XXXX for {$700.00} for tires, but turned around and paid {$800.00} to the card, seven days later, but was still charged interest on the tires! 

I believe I have been outrageously overcharged in interest fees and how they are accruing my monthly averages. 

Please help. I am a working person - 7 days a week. I don't have money for an attorney."
1790,"Wells Fargo submitted inaccurate information to the credit agencies. The supposed credit balance they submitted is {$1700.00} with {$1700.00} credit limit. They sent me documents to prove this what I would them. The documents Wells Fargo sent me are inconsistent with what's on the credit reporting bureaus. 
No signed credit card agreement. 
Wells Fargo is attempting to justify fake credit card account by showing me overdraft statements from the checking account I had with them. I do not know how that justifies a credit card agreement. 
The so-called credit card statements show a credit limit of {$700.00}. Nowhere does it show a credit increase."
1791,Wells Fargo complaint I was seeking {$1000.00} - this offer is good until Tuesday XX/XX/2019 on the XXXX of XXXX the amount will go up to {$5000.00} due to that fact Wells Fargo send a incomplete and misleading or false report to me and the federal agency XXXX
1794,"On XX/XX/2019 I received a letter from wells fargo fraud dept. notifying me there were possible fraud activities on my account and to call them. When I called they notified me that there were {$2500.00} in cash advances taken out on my credit card in CA. I live in Ohio. There were also charges of {$50.00} each of two item transfers. There must have been some other fees because the total balance was {$2600.00}. I told them to immediately close those accounts.

Shortly after that I received two checks from Wells Fargo. One was for {$1200.00} the other one was {$71.00}. Attached to the check was a note stating that I had not fulfilled my obligation to Wells Fargo. 

Due to the fact that when I called the fraud department several times and they refused to give me any information on the account, I am assuming that the money they sent me was from the accounts that were opened that not been used by whoever opened at the accounts. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that because I closed that account they can not reverse the online transfer. Therefore, there will be no adjustment made to my bill and the claim is now closed. 

I have now closed all of my accounts with wells fargo including the new credit card they sent me because of the fraudulent charges on the old card. According to this letter they are holding me responsible for {$2600.00} for all of the fraudulent charges that were made on my credit card account. 

Wells Fargo notified me that there were fraudulent charges on my account while before I even received a bill for them. I had not used this credit card for at least over a year. After them notifying me there was fraudulent activity I received the monthly statement proving that they were correct in telling me that there was fraudulent activity. Obviously, the bank realizes that I did not make these charges but yet are putting them on my bill and making me pay for them. 

When I closed those accounts I was not notified that this would affect the fraud claim. The reason I closed those accounts was because I was afraid there would be more fraudulent activity."
1796,XX/XX/2019. Well Fargo agent contact me about my account being late. They offered to settled the debt and they offered to allow it to be 3 equal payments and would close the account. They account is being misrepresented on my credit report across all three credit bureaus. I have contacted them and they keep transferring me different departments with no resolve to the matter. This is preventing my credit score to improve to get a VA Loan.
1797,"I have credit card with Wells Fargo, and my credit line is {$5000.00}. In XXXX, I received balance transfer offer from Wells Fargo ; the same month XXXX XX/XX/2020 XXXX, I applied for balance transfer in the amount of {$3000.00} plus {$120.00} transfer fee ( total {$3100.00} XXXX. The advertised terms says that "" Enjoy a 0 % APR on balance transfers for 15 months ... .by XX/XX/2020 ... After that, your standard APR for purchases and balance transfer will apply ( currently 22.49 % ) ... 4 % balance transfer fee applies to transfers made in pursuant to this offer '' and Payment terms further says that "" Generally, we will apply your minimum payment first to lower APR balances ( such as Purchases ) before balances with higher APRs ... Payments made in excess of the minimum payment will generally be applied to balances with higher APRs first before balances with lower ones. 
From XX/XX/2020 to XX/XX/2020 I had a purchase balance of {$2600.00}, and I made payment of {$2600.00}. Also, the minimum payment was {$61.00}. According to the Payment terms, {$61.00} minimum payment should be applied to my balance transfer XXXX $ XXXX {$61.00} XXXX, and XXXX should reduce my purchase balance to {$35.00}. And also, my balance transfer balance should be {$3000.00} XXXX $ XXXX {$61.00} XXXX for me to enjoy the advertised 0 % for 15 months ( the reason I made the transaction ). 
Wells Fargo instead, reduced the balance transfer that is subject to 0 % APR for 15 months with my payments. This contrasts with the advertisement and then begins to charge me interest on my purchase balance. My purchase balance is the one with higher APR and balance transfer has lower APR ( 0 % ). 
I called them to complain about this issue, and they sent some documents repeating the terms as advertised, and I thought they would adjust my account balances to reflect the terms. However, Well Fargo refused to make any adjustments but instead, repeated the same practices, reducing the balance transfer balance to almost {$0.00} and charged me interest again. I called their Research and Remediation Analyst, XXXX XXXX at XXXX. She told me there's nothing she can do about it that Wells Fargo can change its advertised terms any time without notice."

Called a representative called XXXX, who claimed to pull up my data, but disconnected the call. Called again and XXXX told me, that the {$200.00} had been credited to another card, which I don't recongnize as my card. 

This all seems to be a big fraud, the promise a reward, make it very difficult to reach anybody, so people just give up and finally they claim to have credited the reard to an account, which the customer doesn't know about nor can access."
1800,"I use Wells Fargo for merchant services ( credit card processing ) I own a small business that was recently scammed by a customer  using stolen credit cards. 
I reported this to wells fargo. They sent me letters showing chargebacks from the victims and removed all funds available in our business accounts and my personal checking account. 
Next they froze our merchant account that receives our credit card charges. They refuse to unfreeze the account but still allow us to run credit card charges to it. Thus our customers are paying their bills each day to a frozen wells fargo account. They have now withheld more than the total amount of the suspected fraud charges. 
I have been told that only the security department at wells fargo can unfreeze the account but when myself or other wells fargo customer service agents call that department, the call goes to voice mail and the mail box is full. 
My company is going to run out of cash to pay employees and bills. We are going to close. But the only department that can apparently help unfreeze my account is unreachable. 
Also, establishing a new credit card processing relationship can take up to a week and does not leave us time to pay the employees or vendors.

I called again to speak to a customer rep, this time they told me that I had payment deferral for 1 month not 3 months - but she made it for 3 months.

1814,"I moved to the XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I opened a bank account and secured credit card with Wells Fargo that year. I was informed it would take two years to build sufficient credit history to switch the secured card to a credit card. 

InXX/XX/XXXX, after speaking with a Wells Fargo online credit employee, I was encouraged to apply for a standard credit card. I asked for a {$600.00} or {$1000.00} credit line to replace my secured card that had a {$600.00} limit. I cancelled my secured card. At the time of my application, my FICO score as reported within my secured Wells Fargo online banking site was XXXX ( excellent ). I had been banking with Wells Fargo for 28 months and they were aware of my XXXX citizenship and XXXX XXXX work status in the XXXX. Wells Fargo conducted a 'hard credit ' check which dropped my reported FICO XXXX from XXXX to XXXX ( good ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating "" Thank you for your credit card account application. We can approve your application if we receive and are able to verify the information requested below by XX/XX/XXXX ... send us a copy of your Social Security card so we can confirm your identity. '' There were no other caveats presented in the letter. 

I responded to the above request and provided my SSN. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Wells Fargo informing me that "" We are unable to offer you a credit card account for the following reasons ... Not a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ''. The letter further stated "" Our decision was based in whole or in part on information in a consumer report ( often called a credit report ) ... '' I followed up in writing and by phone with Wells Fargo and was informed that they have a policy to not issue credit to XXXX non-citizens or green card holders. I was further informed that it is illegal for them to discourage credit applications so they will not publically or transparently disclose their policy to reject individuals based on their national origin ( XXXX ). 

Facts : - Wells Fargo opened an account and secured credit card in my name inXX/XX/XXXX - Wells Fargo has been my primary bank for 28 months and had full documentation that I was a XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX status - Wells Fargo encouraged a credit application and conducted a 'hard credit ' check causing a 38 point drop in my FICO bringing my credit rating down from 'excellent ' to 'good ' - Dated XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo sent a letter confirming my credit application would be approved upon receipt and verification of my SSN number - OnXX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo declined my credit application for being a non-permanent resident of the XXXX and stated that this decision was based on information in a consumer report ( a complete fabrication given their prior communication of XX/XX/XXXX which was in fact after the consumer report inquiry ) Wells Fargo did knowingly and purposefully engage in having me apply for credit knowing that their internal policy would decline credit to non-residents. They purposefully caused me personal harm by negatively impacting my credit report and declining credit despite an 'excellent ' credit rating. 

Wells Fargo did so solely for the purpose of not wanting to breach credit regulations regarding discouraging individuals from applying for credit, but knowing that they would subsequently decline and cause harm to the customer regardless of credit worthiness."
1815,inquiries stil on my re [ ort after 2 years
1816,"I reported fraudulent transactions on my credit card that came from XX/XX/XXXX which is a company I have authorized numerous purchases with before. The charges were not made in person, and I made the customer service representative aware that my card had not been lost nor stolen and had never been out of my possession. 

Tonight, I attempted to make a purchase with this card prior to going to the grocery store and the card was declined. Upon checking my account online, I saw that the card had been closed due to being lost or stolen, though I had never made such a report. 

I was given no noticed of the impending cancellation of this card. I did not receive a phone call, and email nor a letter and have been completely blindsided. In the midst of a pandemic wherein my hours have been cut and my income has decreased by over 60 %, I am left without a usable card with ZERO notice. 

When I called Wells Fargo, I was told that a new card was sent to me and would "" probably '' arrived by Friday. So I will be without a usable card for three full days. I told the customer service rep to reopen my card as I had never reported it stolen in the first place, which she refused to do. Instead, she told me that I could go into a branch and get a cash advance, which of course carries phenomenally high fees. 

Essentially, this company has blindsided me by falsifying information and then telling me my only option is to borrow money from them at an exorbitant rate in the meantime."
1819,"To whom this may concern, I am writing this letter because I have tried numerous times to resolve the issue of late payments during hardship that were reported on my credit report. XXXX was called and verbally told that I was unable to pay the credit card debt at the time because I lost my job due to Hurricane Harvey. I was unable to work. They continued to ask if I had a family member or someone who could help me pay, but I did not. At the time, I did not even have a place to live or a car anymore. I am not only taking care of myself but XXXX young children as well. I was also in XXXX at the time. The first representative I spoke to over the phone, who was female, was very nice and understanding. The second representative, that was a man, was very rude. He was disrespectful especially being that I had already told him and the lady before him everything I could. I told them both that I would be able to make a payment by XX/XX/XXXX. He began to get personal and ask me what would change between the time of his call and XX/XX/XXXX. He even asked where I would get this money from. I tried to explain my situation the best I could, but when he raised his voice, I had to hang up the phone. With all that being said, I stayed true to that promise. I was able to make a payment on XX/XX/XXXX and by XX/XX/XXXX, the debt was completely paid off. These representatives did not note my account of me being in a hardship or even provide other options of other routes ( lower monthly payments, lower interest rate, etc. ) to work out an agreement to save my account or protect my credit. Not only was my account closed, but I also had to pay late payments between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 
For the last two months, I have been sending letters and emails in hopes of having these late payments during the dates of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX removed from all three credit reports. The account is now closed and paid off. I have only received one letter back stating that they could not dispute accurate information, however, this information is not accurate. I do not believe they have done the proper investigation with my account being that I let XXXX know I was unable to pay due to loss of job and home because of Hurricane Harvey. I have attached bill statements to correspond with my promise to pay by XX/XX/XXXX as well as the letters/emails sent for the request of late payment removals. Dates are included on letters. All personal information is blacked out due to privacy."
1820,"I purchased jewelry at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, MN. with the understanding that I could pay it off in six months with no interest. Much to my surprise, I received a Wells Fargo Credit Card with the first monthly bill. I did not ask for and did not want a credit card. I have never used the card and have paid the monthly bills by check. 

I am submitting this information because I received an e-mail which I believe may have come from the CFPB asking if I have ever received a Wells Fargo credit card that I did not request or want."
1822,"I filed a complaint on XX/XX/18. File number XXXX. There response was to retaliate by quadrupling my minimum payment. In addition, they charged me for a second time, a transfer fee, and yet again charged me interest on my account. At what point does, CFBP step in and fine them for this?"
1830,"I close my credit card with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX with a customer care agent on the phone at that time I was told I had a XXXX balance but a credit pending of {$30.00} she said she would send me a check after the The credit posted to my account which is now closed so they sent me a check. Approximately three weeks later they sent me a letter asking me to cash the check as I have not cashed it yet then approximately XX/XX/XXXX, I received a bill from Wells Fargo for a approx. {$81.00}. I called right away to find out what the charges were for I was told that the merchant issued a credit to my account for the {$30.00} so XXXX was attempting to re-collect the {$30.00} check they sent to me and doing so they try to re-collect it from a closed savings account I once had since the account was closed there was a {$25.00} bounce check fee that Wells Fargo assessed to me. Since a couple of months have passed I was also then hit with a late fee I didnt even know these charges were out there I called to dispute this in the meantime my credit was dinged now Im being told that I still owe Wells Fargo a total of {$71.00}. I do not understand what the {$71.00} is for I paied {$25.00} in XXXX On that bill I did not think I would owe to prevent any further late fees while this is getting resolved its not getting resolved they can not tell me why I owe {$71.00} which is 25+ an  outstanding XXXX, I have two primary questions one if there was a credit from the merchant issued to my account was it prior to closing up my account in which case Wells Fargo failed is noticed that while I was on the phone with them that credit had been posted from the merchant if the credit was given to me after my card closed where is it I have not received {$30.00} from the merchant. I also have a charge for {$30.00} on my statement for XX/XX/XXXX and the same amount for {$30.00} for XX/XX/XXXX? Id like an explanation, I feel Wells Fargo is negligent and not noticing that they not only sent me a check but then another letter asking me to cash a check and then to go back to a closed savings account to try to recover that payment without notifying me and then hitting me with bounced check fees late fees and dinging my credit is just outlandish"
1832,"Please see attached correspondence. I am being held responsible for over {$12000.00} in charges made without my authorization. The fraudulent charges were made over two weeks in XX/XX/2017, a holiday period during which the risk of fraud is known to be high. The total charged fraudulently during this two week period was almost double the highest monthly charges to the account in two years and nearly four times the average monthly balance for 2017. As set forth in the attachments to this complaint, in type, volume, amount, pattern and type of merchant, the charges clearly and obviously were unusual and suspicious as compared to prior account activity. I learned of the identity theft only after my Wells Fargo VISA credit card was declined for a modest purchase at a grocery store and I promptly called Wells Fargo customer service. It was only on my initiative in calling and in checking my account on-line while speaking with customer service personnel that the fraud was identified. Contrary to every telephone conversation about the matter with representatives of Wells Fargo, during which I was assured that I would not be held responsible for the unauthorized charges, I now understand that Wells Fargo is holding me liable without supporting evidence and without advising me of any recourse or rights that I might have. The Wells Fargo correspondence states only that Wells Fargo found no fraud occurred [ s ] ince your card was in your possession. ( See correspondence attached. ) Insofar as Wells Fargo has acknowledged the fact that the card was in my possession, and insofar as the Federal Reserve Board guidance states that the cardholder is not liable when the card itself is not presented, I may not be held liable for the unauthorized charges. See 12 C.F.R. 226.12 ( b ), Federal Reserve Board Official Staff Interpretation. 
Without explanation, without notifying me of my right to appeal and without providing upon my request any justification for the conclusion, Wells Fargo determined that no fraud occurred or that the transactions were authorized. Wells Fargo thus inappropriately is holding me liable for the unauthorized charges."
1833,"Wells Fargo closed my credit card accounts due to inactivity which negatively affected my credit score which in turn I was not able to obtain a good mortgage rate, & insurance"
1835,"Today, XX/XX/2021. I contacted Wells Fargo/XXXX XXXX for a credit line increase. They wanted to do a hard credit pull I said no and stated why and then disconnected the call. Roughly two hours later I see that the hard credit pull occurred without my consent. My FICO score went down 7 points immediately ( I check my credit daily ) and it happened right after the credit pull. I called and filed a complaint and they said it may take 10 business days. This was an illegal credit pull and with the 7 point drop in FICO, I have already suffered damages. I would give my consent for you to pull that phone call to review. I would like this resolved with the full force of the FCRA ( Fair Credit Reporting Act."
1836,"Problem associated with a Wells Fargo credit card used for balance transfers. I used the credit card to make 2 balance transfers that occurred approximately 1 year apart. No other purchases were made on the card. The first balance transfer was for an 18 month period at a 0 % rate and the second balance transfer was for a 12 month period at a 0 % rate. I was making payments to cover the first balance transfer and had covered the initial balance transfer prior to the promotional expiration date along with amounts to begin payment on the 2nd balance transfer. The monthly statements did not show the remaining balances broken out by promotional offer so I was unable to see that they were applying the majority of the payment to the second balance transfer ( even though the rates were both 0 % and their disclosures indicated that the payments would be applied to lower APR balances before higher ones - it definitely was not clear that they were looking at some other rate besides 0 % ). I feel that the monthly statements were deliberately misleading in that the balances by promotional transfers were not broken out and they easily could have been since they were obviously tracking it. As a result, I found out 2 months after the expiration of the first promotional period that I still had {$500.00} remaining on the first promotional period ( that I thought I had repaid in full ) and interest began to be charged. I called Wells Fargo to complain and they waived the first month of interest but that doesn't correct the problem going forward. They should be required to clearly report outstanding balances by promotional period if multiple balance transfers are outstanding. 
Thank you, XXXX XXXX"
1843,"Wells Fargo offered me an 0 % interest credit card promotional rate that expires what I thought would be XXXX of XXXX, but I was just told it expires XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX, they sent me a promotional check to use with a 0 % interest for one year. The disclosure statement read "" we will apply your minimum payment FIRST to lower APR balances. '' So I decided to use the check for {$600.00} since I had a year to pay it off. I got a second offer in the mail XXXX of XXXX with the same offer and the same wording and decided to use that check for {$200.00}. I have a {$7000.00} credit card limit that has never been about {$3000.00}. Since I knew the first promotional rate was about to expire, for the last year I've worked hard to get the balance down. My balance today is {$900.00}. I knew the other two offers totaling {$800.00} had time to expire, so I was about to make the last payment today of {$100.00} toward the first balance so I wouldn't have to pay any extra intrest. I called Well Fargo and spoke with XXXX to where she informed me that I still has a promotional balance left of {$580.00} that would expire XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her how is that possible when the other two promotional rates came after this one. She then explained they apply the minimum payment between all three 0 % balances. I pulled out the statement and read the exact offer letter and read the exact samething to her. "" We will apply your minimum payment first to lower APR balances. '' I advised her it doesnt say anything about splitting it between the the three zero percent balances, becasue the first one had not been paid off yet. So my understanding of the payments would be applied to that one first. She put me on hold and transfer me to the customer care team. I spoke to XXXX XXXX who had a matter of fact tone, that she didn't care and the bank split my payments between all three balances. I advised her again, nowhere on the two offer letters does it read if the APR balances are the same it would be split between all three, the wording is FIRST to the lower. I asked her to send me what she is saying in writing so I can see if for myself. She advised me she had nothing she can send me to prove what she was saying but instead would create a case for me so a higher party can review it. I was only asking since it was explained in detail how the money was going to be posted, to reapply my payments to cover the first promotional balance. Instead, I was told I would be created a case #, and someone will follow up with me. I asked when she said she didn't know. I asked when should I follow up, she didn't know. So, I'm taking the matter in my own hands. Wells Fargo should have clearly defined that it would be split between all three 0 %  cards. I would have never used the other offers knowing I wouldn't have time to pay it off. I just want my payments backed off and applied to how it was written. Case # XXXX."
1845,"In order to help out my brother, to help improve his finances, we called Wells Fargo Thursday XX/XX/XXXX to stop his ability to get cash advances through his credit card. The idea is to plan ahead, understand what one should do, and make a long term decision with the credit card company, to hinder ones ability 'in the moment ' to compromise and give in to getting a cash advance.

Wells Fargo refused to do this, saying they couldn't. I don't believe them. If they can increase limits, they can also decrease limits, and they can stop ability to do advances. They just don't want to.

I called again on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX, with my Wells Fargo credit card account. I asked for them to stop and freeze my ability to do cash withdrawals. They refused and said they couldn't. I asked for them to lower my cash advance limit, to an emergency type of level ( like {$100.00} ). Again they refused and said they couldn't.

I believe it is right and proper for consumers to have the ability to reduce ones limit for cash advances. We already have the ability to limit total credit limits.

Credit card companies make it too easy for people to access and make cash advances ( and they charge them exhorbidant interest rates to boot ). I believe this preys on people 'in the momemt ' and offers them quick cash in the moment. While they state the interest rate, not all consumers understand this, and the 'fine print ' of what the credit card companies charge ( 25 % interest, interest daily and immediately ). I believe it is in the consumers best interest to have the ability to limit ones long term access to cash advances. What are the credit card companies afraid of? THey make obscene amounts of money off cash advances and don't want this golden goose cut. It's just not right. Consumers should have the option to limit it for themselves and others who hold their credit cards."

1847,I just saw on my credit report that I have an open account with Wells Fargo Credit Card SVCS and I have  never in my life opened any account under Wells Fargo clearly someone is stealing my identity. I already filed a complaint with the credit bureau as well as identity theft org this is unacceptable and I already knew Wells Fargo history with fraud I just never realized I would be a victim to this.
1850,"Around the beginning of XX/XX/2020, two large amounts deposited to my credit card, one was for {$3100.00} and the other was about {$2400.00}. Transactions were made at XXXX XXXX twice and XXXX XXXX three times using these transferred and charged to my credit card and also XXXX  charges. I dont remember the exact amounts of these transactions, as I reported my card stolen in XXXX when I noticed these charges and when I received a new card I saw a returned payment on the new card for {$3100.00} and an outstanding balance on my new credit card close to {$3000.00} when it should have been less than {$100.00} originally. I contacted my bank so they can hopefully resolve this issue as I have no idea how these funds were transferred and used at these places."
1854,"I have transferred my credit card balance from my Wells Fargo credit card to my XXXX XXXX credit card. XXXX send Wells Fargo the check and the balance transfer was transferred. However despite Wells Fargo accepting the check from XXXX, and XXXX completed the transfer, Wells  states that the never received any money from XXXX  for the transfer.

1856,"Wells Fargo Card Service is reaging their account by currently reporting on my credit report 52 charge offs when they can only report 1 the most recent as XX/XX/XXXX when this account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX, this is a serious violation of FCRA also very damaging to my credit worthiness and misleading to potential creditors"
1857,"My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX, I live in XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I am a Wells Fargo cardholder since XXXX. I have never had a bad experience with you until this occasion. I explain my calvary below : On XX/XX/XXXX, I realized that the Wells Fargo mobile application disappeared from my cell phone. It was not until XX/XX/XXXX that I was able to reinstall the application with the help of my daughter. At that moment I realized that there were charges to my Platium Visa credit card ending in XXXX which I did not recognize! I have to mention that while all these purchases were made, I had my credit card with me. Transactions that I do not recognize and did not make : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX STORES # XXXX {$76.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX STORES # XXXX {$130.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$14.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX STORES # XXXX {$79.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX STORES # XXXX {$79.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX STORES # XXXX {$120.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX STORES # XXXX {$26.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX {$4.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$480.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX {$500.00} XX/XX/XXXX CASH ADVANCE FEE {$25.00} XX/XX/XXXX CASH ADVANCE FEE {$25.00} XX/XX/XXXX CASH ADVANCE FEE {$24.00} XX/XX/XXXX CASH ADVANCE FEE {$25.00} Plus a transfer to a bank card number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$4900.00} It was already night time, around XXXX XXXX, but I immediately called the Wells Fargo phone number that I saw on the back of my credit card to report it. They gave me a report number and they told me they would send me another card and that I would not need to worry, that they were going to investigate. 
About three days later, I checked my Wells fargo app and noticed that my Platinum Visa account had been deleted. At that moment the only thing that occurred to me, is that because of your investigation, that account in particular had been suspended since I could see my other accounts in my app. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called because I had not received the new card, the person on the phone told me that they had sent it but that it had been returned because you had the wrong address, so I gave them the correct address. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received the card, my daughter and I tried to activate it through the mobile application but we could not because it did not appear that I had received a new card, it was a bit strange. 
On the XXXX and XXXX I tried again and even by phone I couldnt activate it. Until XX/XX/XXXX when I crossed the border into USA I was able to activate my card by phone. After doing so, I called the XXXX number on the back of the card and asked what was happening with my case and they answered me that everything had been resolved and that they were going to send me a letter with the detailed case and that I could use my new card as usual. By the way, until today, I have never received the letter detailing the resolution of the case. 
At that time I told the agent that I wanted an additional card for my daughter XXXX XXXX. He said that he was going to send two new cads and that as soon as they arrived, I should destroy the card I had just activated to start using the two new ones. 
So, that same day, I made a purchase at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA for the amount of {$460.00}. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to the XXXX XXXX branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX. in XXXX XXXX because I could not access my account in my mobile application and I wanted to pay the balance on my card. I was attended by representative XXXX XXXX. I give her my user number and password. Then she gives me the balance of {$8100.00}! 
Astounded, I told her that the amount was wrong, I did not owe that much, that I only owed the {$460.00} what I had spent at XXXX XXXX and {$16.00} that I had been charged for sending me both cards with a rush time. I only recognize those two transactions as mine. She also tells me that one of those is a transfer to a bank card number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$4900.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. One month after the day I had made the call for identity theft and fraud abot my account! 
I could not believe what this lady was telling me. I tried to tell her again what had happened, she replies that she does not know anything and she makes a call. During that call and without talking to me or asking me any questions, she talks in English ( remember, I only speak XXXX ) for a while and hangs up the phone. 
She gives me a letter, of wich I have included a copy, and tells me that I will receive a phone call with an answer. Although most likely she will receive the call because she is the excecutive. 
Miss XXXX XXXX makes an appointment for XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. I could not go that day and I missed the appointment. Although she says that maybe that day there is still no answer and that if one would come, she should be the first to know it because it is easier to contact the executive than the client. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I made another call to the number that appears on the internet for personal accounts XXXX. I was told that, that day they did not attend fraud cases, only Monday through Friday and from XXXX to XXXX. The lady helping me said she would leave a note because it was not her department. 
As I did not receive any answer or call, I called again on the XXXX. That day they told me that my case had already been resolved ; that they had sent me a letter ( second letter that up until now I havent received ) where the resolution of the case was that I had done those transactions. I told the person on the phone that those charges were not made at all by me. I continued to deny those charges and that is how that call ended ; the bank insisting without proving to me that I made any of those transactions/purchases. I was not present during any of those transactions, someone else made them. 
In addition to not having received any letters. I did not know how to respond and I called again on the XXXX. They told me the same thing again, the case is resolved, there is nothing to do, you have to pay that debt, if you disagree you have to write a letter explaining your case and send it to Credit Card Fraud Claims to reconsider your case. 
On the XXXX, I went back to the branch with the same Miss XXXX XXXX who told me the same thing, there is nothing to do, just pay the debit. 
For my part I demand a reconsideration to my case and have it reviewed again, as well as a review of my transactions of the more than 20 years that I have been your customer. I had never used the Cash Advance service and much less as frecuent as it was done ; also in these 20 years I have not made transfers from any credit card. 
I think if the bank sees an unusual movement, I should be contacted or alerted in as many ways posible about any unusual money activity. 
I also do not understand how, after a month of having reported the fraud on my card, without the account appearing in my mobile application and without the new card being issued, arrived or having activated it, a transfer to another unknown card could have been made! In fact, I always wanted to pay the card of my other daughter who is also a Wells Fargo account holder and I could never do it because the bank told me that I could not transfer to other cards unless they were just mine. Someone had to have authorized that transaction. I dont want to think that the fraud is internal among the bank 's staff because nobody has been able to help me or solve my case. Or maybe if they look at the name of the card to whom the transfer was made they will realize who was the one who committed the crime. Or if they looked at the ATM 's cameras at the time the withdrawals were made. Or if they also saw the cameras of establishments like the XXXX stores at the time they paid. I do not know! I do not do that but you do! 
To say the least, Im feeling ignored and abused so much so, that after my more tan 20 years relationship with Wells fargo Im being trated as a liar and in my heart you make me a criminal. 
It seems that this type of fraud is very common among Wells Fargo and I am one more in the bunch. I do not accept the resolution to pay for something I did not do. I demand that Wells Fargo Bank prove to me that I was the one who made those transactions and clarify how it was that the bank came to the conclusion that I must pay these charges. 

I appreciate the attention to it. 
Thank You XXXX XXXX XXXX"
1860,"Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX fraudulently signed me up for the Wells Fargo Visa Home Projects credit card, without my knowledge or consent, to finance a purchase of windows that I have not agreed to purchase. 

Please see the attached materials in support of the CFPB complaint. 

I request the CFPB to investigate the Wells Fargo Visa Home Projects credit card product line for widespread fraud and consumer abuses."
1866,"I have tried twice to send you this complaint and finally earlier today had a test complaint go through. 
I feel i have been scammed by Wells Fargo Bank. On XXXX XXXX someone used my Wells Fargo visa card to deposit {$6500.00} in a small business checking account my brother and I share. Then a man called me claiming to be from XXXX and said that XXXX owed me {$400.00} and in error he had deposited {$6500.00} in my account. He wanted me to go to XXXX and get {$6000.00} in gift cards. I did not fall for this scam. I reported this to the Wells Fargo Fraud Division and was told to do nothing until they investigated. I did move the {$6500.00} into my personal checking account as we did not wish to comingle funds. I was out of the country for 3 weeks and when I returned, I had a letter from the bank saying that I either made the deposit or someone who one was authorized to use the card made the deposit. No one was authorized to use the card. then I received a bill not only for the {$6500.00} but with added fees and interest. 
From XXXX until XXXX, I called the Fraud Division of Wells Fargo asking how this investigation was conducted, who the authorized user of my credit card is and that the interest and fees on my bill be voided as I had followed their instructions about not paying the {$6500.00}. On each call I was transferred to four to six people, none of whom seemed to know what to do but all told me not to pay anything until the matter was resolved.. Finally in XXXX i got another letter again saying either I or an authorized user was responsible for the {$6500.00} transfer. No questions were answered. I now supposedly owe over {$800.00} in fees and interest. I recently paid the {$6500.00} but nothing else."
1868,"I recently looked at my credit reports and noticed that Wells Fargo Financial XXXX reported negative marks PAYS 30 DAYS late on my reports WITHOUT ever telling me they were going to report them. I believe this is incredibly unfair and had I received the federally mandated notice to me, I would have paid on time. 
According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act Section 623 ( a ) ( 7 ) ( A ) ( i ) and ( B ) ( i ), they has a  responsibility to provide a notice furnishing of negative information, in writing, to the customer and that this notice is to be given to the consumer prior to or no later than 30 days after furnishing the negative information In fact, the Federal Reserve even created a published form so that creditors can be in compliance. 
Here is the compliant verbiage : We may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. 
In short, I never received such a warning notice! 
I understand that according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, failing to provide this notice can result in a penalty up to {$2500.00} and can be enforced by the FTC, and that my state attorney general can also enforce this with a {$1000.00} penalty as well. 

I attached a copy of the law and the actual document from the federal reserve"
1871,"On XX/XX/2020, I applied for a new credit card with Wells Fargo under my name. We got the new credit card ( along with the letter ) in the mail a couple weeks later, but it was missing the envelope. It felt like someone had taken it out of the envelope, taken note of the credit card number/expiration date/etc., and just put it back in our mailbox hoping nobody would notice, and just discarded the envelope. Someone could easily have gotten my credit card number by unfolding the letter, peeling the credit card off the sticky, and putting it back on the sticky spot. 

We called Wells Fargo and told them what happened, and they cancelled the card and expedited us a new one, overnight delivery. The new card was in an overnight delivery ( large ) envelope that requires ripping open in order to get to it ( very secure ) ; however, the envelope housing the credit card letter was not sealed at all. But we figured that was okay because the unsealed envelope was in another larger, sealed envelope. 

We filed a complaint with the United States Postal Service and they launched an investigation to see if maybe the mail deliverer opened the mail to get the credit card info and then just discarded the envelope. The investigation came back negative ; they don't know for sure, but nobody else had this issue on our postal route, so it was unlikely that the carrier had anything to do with it. 

However, we got the rest of the letter in the mail today, XX/XX/2020. It was in a "" FOUND LOOSE IN MAILS XXXX  SECTION '' in XXXX XXXX XXXX, UT post office. 

My assumption is that Wells Fargo 's envelope-sealing was not working for these few days, or something. But this leads to privacy issues, and I'm sure I'm not the only one."
1873,"THE WHOLE 6 IN A HAPF YEAR 'S, ME & MY FAMILY HAS BEEN DEALING WITH YOU ALL, YOU ALL NEVER TRIED TO FIX THE PROBLEM, NEVER BOTHERED TO WORK IT OUT"
1887,"I received my XXXX statement and noticed a {$12.00} interest charge with no explanation. I have my account on Auto Pay for {$870.00} a month, well above the minimum payment to pay off my balance within the allotted time frame. 
When I called to inquire about the interest charge, I was told it was on a previous promotion that was not paid off in the proper time frame. I asked how was that possible when I was paying so much above the minimum payment. I was told that according to the Wells Fargo payment program, payments were allocated to the highest balance first and the remaining amount is then applied to the lower balance. 
First, the allocation to the different balances is not shown anywhere on the statement. What is shown under the Interest Charge Calculation is an Ending Balance for a Promotional Balance, but nothing is shown on the remaining 0 % Purchases Balance. The first thing that shows up here is on my XXXX Statement that shows the Balance Subject to Interest Rate is {$920.00}. When I asked about this, I was told this figure means nothing and that my remaining balance on the prior promotion was {$330.00}. So, I asked how do I pay this off since I was told the automated payment plan was fixed and could not be changed. I was told to make my usual payment and then when it posted to make an extra payment for the balance on the first promotion. I have made my payment of {$870.00} and an additional payment of {$400.00} to be sure the prior promotion is paid off. I will wait to see if this is in fact true and I will not be charged interest again. 
Nowhere on my statement is there a section that explains about your allocated payment program either with a table or an explanation under the written section titled Important Information About Your Account. Without making a call and trying to figure out what the problem was I would again have been charged interest that my monthly payments were more than adequate to pay off in a timely manner. 
Your allocated payment plan practice ensures that you will be able to charge interest even when sufficient payments have been made to more than cover the remaining balance by the XX/XX/XXXX due date. I made payments totally {$3200.00} from XXXX through XXXX with only a minimum payment requirement of {$520.00} to avoid interest. Clearly there were sufficient funds to pay the XXXX balance of {$1600.00} off before XX/XX/XXXX and still have sufficient funds to apply to the balance transfer in XXXX and the associated fees that are not due to be paid off until XX/XX/XXXX. 
In the statements before XX/XX/XXXX under the Interest Charge Calculation it does state that the promotional rate on purchases expires on XX/XX/XXXX but it shows a {$0.00} balance subject to the interest rate until the XXXX statement. Also, the promotional balance that expires on XX/XX/XXXX shows an Ending Balance so why is this same information not shown on the Purchases to alert the consumer that there is an amount owing on this promotion. 
I wrote the company and told them to consider this a formal complaint that their allocated payment program is in fact a hidden interest charge that a consumer has no way of finding out about until it appears on a statement showing interest is owing with no explanation. I also told them that I planned to file a complaint with the appropriate consumer agencies since as a consumer I believe this practice is in reality a hidden fee/interest that is totally unacceptable and takes advantage of even the most educated consumer. 
When I sent my letter I referenced my credit card number so the company has all the relevant documents related to my complaint in their own records."
1888,"I made a balance transfer of {$5000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX with a promotional rate of XXXX which expires on XXXX XXXX.

On XX/XX/2021, I made a payment of {$5000.00}. 
The minimum payment was {$56.00}. 
The overpayment was applied to the balance with the lower interest rate. 
{$4900.00} should had been applied to the balance with the higher interest rate. 
I am now paying 18 % on a balance and my promotional rate balance is XXXX."
1894,"I went to Wells Fargo in XXXX to advise them that, as a result of a XXXX, traumatic event, and various health problems that resulted in hospitalization, I would have no income for the remainder of 2017. Thus, I would be unable to make my upcoming credit card payment. I asked them to discuss options to pay off this debt without incurring late fees, severe interest charges, and so on. 

They advised me to NOT make a payment on the account and that once a certain amount of time passes, they would be able to assist with refinancing this debt ( they even provided the specific options that would be available, such as switching the debt to a XXXX interest card ). They assured me that since I was a Wells Fargo customer for XXXX years and never missed a credit card payment, they would be able to work with my situation. 

Per their instruction, I did not make payments and went back to Wells Fargo after the suggested timeframe ( into XXXX ) so that I could discuss this with them as well as discuss why I was charged fees even after speaking with them. Then they advised me that they can not do anything to refinance and I am required to pay the balance. 

I have incurred {$500.00} worth of fees in the timeframe during which I was sick and hospitalized on numerous occasions."
1900,"On XX/XX/2019, I got a cashier check from my Credit Union in the amount of {$2300.00} to my credit card company - XXXX XXXX. Somehow Wells Fargo Bank got hold of the check and cashed it. There was not any information on the check pertaining to Wells Fargo, but the check was cashed. I have tried several times in phone calls to get the money returned. I have been told that Wells Fargo handles credit cards accounts for XXXX XXXX but XXXX XXXX personnel told me they are an independent bank. Wells Fargo Bank said that I had to go to my bank or to XXXX XXXX for assistance. But they told me that it is Wells Fargo Bank 's responsibility because they cashed the check that was not written to them. Still, they refused and my bank has tried and sent a request but Wells Fargo Bank Have not responded or acknowledged they received the request."
1903,"On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a Wells Fargo Secured Credit Card under my old name. When I applied, I spoke to one of the customer service reps who informed that after a year of maintaining a stable account balance on the card, Wells Fargo may return to me the security deposit in full that I paid as collateral on the card. It is now past a year and around the last week of XX/XX/XXXX requested that Wells Fargo return me the security deposit I paid to open the account. Wells Fargo denied my request based on their review that my account is not eligible to receive the security deposit refund yet. I disputed their decision based on my positive transaction history over the past 12 months including 2 PAYMENTS OF THE FULL BALANCE ( {$1000.00} ) in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I also had made numerous full balance payments on this card within those 12 months in addition to being late ( less than 10 days past due ) ONLY 3 times. I really need my security deposit as I am struggling to find stable employment and the security deposit of {$1000.00} will help me pay off the current balance on the card."
1904,"I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from wells fargo telling me that they did a risk review of my credit card account and had decided to close it. I have never been over the limit or late on a payment as a matter of fact I paid the balance in full every month. Immediately called on XX/XX/XXXX ( when i received the letter ) and was connected to the executive office and spoke with XXXX. I explained that I was unable to redeem the rewards I have been saving for years from the card because they closed it. She put me on hold and looked into the matter verifying that I had indeed earned XXXX points through my purchases. She agreed that I am due the rewards and gave me a case number and phone number and said that the case manager would call me the following day. 

The following day I returned a missed call from XXXX my case manager on two occasions but she didn't return my call. On the third call I spoke with the person that answered the phone and he said he would look into whats going on, after a long hold he returned and said that the rewards have been forfeited and that was a final. After informing him I was never given notice or any chance to redeem my honestly earned rewards he just stated again that they have been forfeited. 

I see that closing accounts for no good reason is a common practice at Wells Fargo but I have earned those rewards and this amounts to theft."
1911,Wells Fargo Credit customer service are unprofessional. They do not assist with customer 's complaints and issues. They charged my credit card with fees and high interest rate. My credit card limit was {$3.00}. They charged me {$1500.00} with fees and interest. I was trying to pay them {$150.00} a month but they kept on charging me more and more. The credit card was use in the amount of {$2400.00}. They closed my credit card account and has reflected in my credit report/score. I do not owe the amount of what they are charging me. I have contacted the about this issue and they won't help me.
1912,"Wells Fargo Bank NA - XXXX 'XXXX XXXX Credit card I set up automatic payments far above the minimum payment due. These payments would coincide with my pay cycle and thus make the payments earlier and earlier each month. 
Two key parts of this complaint are a. Wells Fargo increases the minimum payment due each month despite the overall balance becoming significantly less. I speculate that once they detect an automated payment source with a consistent amount, they make the new minimum payment slightly higher than the set amount. Example ( current Balance due + {$430.00} ( minimum Payment due + {$100.00} ). My automatic payment is {$100.00}. Now, because of the {$9.00} difference, they can charge a late fee and potentially report a credit delinquency. When this was set up, the balance was $ XXXX AND THE MINIMUM PAYMENT WAS {$40.00}. 
B. ) Wells Fargo applies payments made early to a prior months ' balance instead of paying forward as the next payment due. This too creates an opportunity for them to charge a late fee, when in actuality the payment was 3+weeks early."

They refused to tell me who asked for the debit card. I don't know how that person got access to my personal information. I told her that I truly believe an employee is responsible. I follow protocol for logon. The thing that really irks me about Wells Fargo is the logon, every month they're requesting a new username or password, not an exaggeration.

1919,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a XXXX 's XXXX XXXX XXXX in a XXXX 's in XXXX, TX, and was approved. I used the card to make a purchase of {$270.00}.

On XX/XX/XXXX, the same day I received the bill, I immediately went online, created an account, and paid {$270.00}, the full balance reflected on my bill. At this time, I noticed an additional charge : a {$27.00} late fee. I called customer service at XXXX, where a customer service representative by the name of XXXX agreed to waive the late fee via a {$27.00} credit to my account, which he said "" would be reflected on the next bill. '' He also strongly encouraged me to sign up for paperless bill via my email account. I agreed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received my next bill, which DID NOT reflect a credit of {$27.00} as promised. In addition, I have been charged interest on this fee which I was never supposed to be charged, bringing my account balance to {$29.00} instead of {$0.00}. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have not been able to obtain satisfaction on this issue. I was lied to and then cheated out of money by customer service.

1922,"I noticed a strange monthly autopay on my Wells Fargo checking statement that went back as far as I could look on the WF online banking. The payment was for Wells Fargo credit card that did not show up on my online banking, nor did I recall opening the account. I called Wells Fargo in XXXX and told them of this issue. They said the account was opened in XXXX in a branch, but without a signature. I do not believe I opened this account. Since XXXX, Wells Fargo has been taking from my checking account anywhere from $ XXXX $ XXXX monthly and paying this credit card which I never had possession of, nor did it appear in my online banking. When I spoke to them in XXXX, they said they would open an investigation and give me a call in 2 business days. A month later, they still had not called me back. I called again and they said they closed the case. I opened another case and no one called me. They sent the letter from their "" investigation '' to my old mailing address. The investigation letter contained a number of false statements ( for example, it said the credit card had been used as recently as XX/XX/XXXX, but I obtained all the statements and it had not been used since XXXX ). I called back and was given the run around once again. I believe Wells Fargo fraudulently opened this account in XXXX, withdrew thousands from my checking to "" pay '' it, and now have been giving me the run around for nearly two months."
1923,"My credit card was reported 30-59 days late in XX/XX/2017. When I discover this, I immediately payed off the late payment to getit back on track. I have never missed a payment on this card and I opened this card specifically to build my credit now, its hurting my credit. The weird thing about this is the reason why I never missed a payment is because I have auto-pay. I have auto-pay on all my cards so I don't miss a payment. I do not log on to make payments, I have over multiple credit cards with all different due dates, it would be impossible to manage any other way. I am not sure how this happened but this card was originally a secure card and was turn into a traditional card in the summer, I am not sure if this had anything to do with it, and I had to re-activate auto-pay but was not told about it. 

Regardless, I called the credit card hotline after I payed the late payment to resolve the issue and I went in circles with the customer service rep and this was never resolved."

1926,"I made a balance transfer into wells Fargo. I setup the transfer 8 days before the 1st payment was due and set up recurring payments for there after. The 1st payment and recurring payments were 7 times the minimum payment required by the bank. On the date when the payment was due the payment FAILED. Since the XX/XX/XXXX was a Saturday I waited and checked my PAYING BANK ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) on Monday, Tuesday, & Wednesday morning to see if there was a withdrawal by Wells Fargo. By around XXXX XXXX I got an email saying the payment failed. When I PERSONALLY investigated the issue I discovered that the routing number was NOT the one that I entered into their system which I copied from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX page INSIDE MY XXXX ACCOUNT. Both Routing Number & Account Number was COPIED and then PASTED from the XXXX  page inside my account INTO Wells Fargo 's payment page. Thus the account was setup. 

After I received the email when speaking with the WELLS FARGO representative I discovered that the ROUTING NUMBER in their system was NOT the one I pasted from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX MY ACCOUNT page but some OTHER ROUTING number which is UNRELATED to regular customer banking operations. Obviously this was a SLY SHARP PRACTICE by WELLS FARGO where they TAMPERED with my information TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE it is my fault when in fact I have NEVER SEEN that number on any of my XXXX accounts at XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Since the payment was scheduled 8 days before it was due and 7 times the minimum required the onus was on Wells Fargo to VALIDATE and to ensure the routing and account numbers were valid because once setup the information is HIDDEN from me and there is no way for me to edit if there was any error. 

I have XXXX  cards with MANY BANKS and I NEVER EVER encountered a CORRUPT PRACTICE like the one a WELLS FARGO. When the representative verified the routing number that came in the email it was a XXXX XXXX XXXX 's routing number but since that number is NOT DISPLAYED in NONE of my XXXX XXXX XXXX accounts I have no clue as to from where this number was GENERATED by WELLS FARGO. The stories I hear about the PERPETUAL CORRUPTION at Wells Fargo and the FIRING of the CEO for SIMILAR CORRUPT practices in the MEDIA just goes to AFFIRM that the BANK is CORRUPT TO THE CORE and their staff at their IT department is COLLUDING in STEALING MONEY from customer accounts via very SHARP CORRUPT PRACTICE. 

The folks at Wells Fargo think that they are VERY SMART and their CUSTOMERS are XXXX. Just to let these CRIMINALS KNOW, I have seen BIGGER THIEVES in my life and they are NO MATCH. I can smell a ROTTEN FISH  miles away. 

The THIEVES at Wells Fargo should be FINED BILLIONS in PENALTY and their EMPLOYEES THROWN in JAIL like XXXX XXXX for RIPPING OFF INNOCENT people for MAXIMIZING their entertainment expenses. 

After MULTIPLE attempts at calling and talking to people that I have not physically seen at WELLS FARGO a person by the name of XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX from their EXECUTIVE OFFICE called me one afternoon and made a NEW EMPTY BLOATED PROMISE/XXXX saying they are INVESTIGATING, that is WITHOUT REVERSING the ILLEGAL CHARGE of $ XXXX/-. Any non-CORRUPT financial institution would IMMEDIATELY reverse those charges while the investigation is in process. 

I FEEL LIKE VOMITING when I think of WELLS FARGO. 

They charged/SLAPPED me with {$27.00} in FINANCE CHARGES. Just IMAGINE, if XXXX XXXX customers are ILLEGALLY charged $ XXXX   monthly its EASY {$27.00} XXXX in REVENUE every month for Wells Fargo. 

ITS 100 % COLLUSION INSIDE the BANK, and I don't want to GIVE WELLS FARGO my money other than the INITIAL TRANSFER FEE for FREE. 

Several XXXX message were sent and that is when they responded INITIALLY to my concern. Later "" many many many '' XXXX message were sent and they were ALL IGNORED BY Wells Fargo.

All that is required is that I state that I was charged for the product and that I have not received it. 

A temporary credit is also normally immediately issued, but not in this case. 

Furthermore, a XXXX search of the company involved will reveal a history of problems."
1932,"BOTTOM LINE : After over four years, Wells Fargo refuses to graduate me from a secured credit card to an unsecured card despite assurances to the contrary, or explain why not. They have kept hold of my {$300.00} collateral and continue to charge a {$25.00} annual fee indefinitely, providing contradictory information on how graduation decisions are made. Their only proposed solution is to update my income information, which has been done several times with no results. Dozens of complaints posted online suggest there is a systemic issue with Wells Fargo accepting secured card deposits, charging annual fees, and never graduating secured card users. 


-- -- -- -- -- In XX/XX/XXXX, a banker at my university 's Wells Fargo branch offered to open a Wells Fargo ( WF ) Secured Credit card account for me in order to build a credit history since I did not have any credit in the past. As someone who has just enrolled in college, I thought it was a good idea to start building credit so I went ahead and opened an account. 


The WF Secured Credit card stipulated that I would have to give Wells Fargo a secured collateral deposit equal to the credit limit I desired. The minimum amount possible was {$300.00} so I chose that amount. Additionally, the WF Secured Credit card has a {$25.00} annual fee. The banker also explained that as long as I made payments on-time and didn't go over my credit limit, I would be "" graduated '' from the WF Secured Credit card within a year or two. "" Graduation '' in this case entails having my WF Secured Credit Card upgraded to a different, unsecured WF Credit Card and my secured deposit being given back to me. If my memory serves me correctly, the banker also explained that the unsecured Credit Card I would graduate into would not have an annual fee. I was also advised to use my credit card as much as possible ( while paying on time ) to improve my credit. 


I followed the instructions, used the card as much as I could, never went above my credit limit, and paid every single payment on time. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have made more than 50 on-time monthly payments without missing a single one. About ten months after opening my WF Secured Credit card, I was able to apply and receive an unsecured credit card from a different financial institution with an initial credit limit of {$2500.00}. I kept using my WF Secured Credit card often and paid on time. Since then, I have opened four more unsecured credit cards and always made on-time payments on all of these credit accounts. My FICO credit score today is higher than 770. While I made all payments on time, and continued to improve my credit rating, Wells Fargo has still not graduated me from the secured account. 


Over the past 3+ years, I have contacted Wells Fargo customer care about once or twice a year to inquire and complain about the fact that I have not been graduated. Every time I would call, the customer care representative ( s ) would explain that they are surprised I have not been graduated yet given the length of my card-holding and the consistency of my on-time payment record. They would then ask me to update my income information. My income hasn't changed much but I would update it anyway and then wait for months on end. However, not everything I was told over these calls was always consistent. For instance, several of the representatives explained that it was an automated system that periodically reviewed whether accounts are graduated or not, and that decisions are made twice per year. Yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX ), when I called and spoke with three different representatives, the "" executive customer care '' representative explicitly said that it is not an automated system that reviews the accounts. Either way, there is an evident lack of transparency with customers about their account status and the graduation process. Over the years and the numerous Wells Fargo representatives I have talked to about this, not a single one has been able to point out why I have not yet been graduated. Additionally, I have repeatedly asked that someone manually review my case, but the representatives would explain that that would not be possible and the most I can do is file a complaint for "" documentation purposes only ''. 


During all this time, Wells Fargo has continued to withhold the {$300.00} collateral and charge the {$25.00} annual fee. While I would gladly close my WF Secured Credit card as well has my Wells Fargo Checking and Savings accounts, closing down my oldest credit card would harm my credit rating. 


A quick search on the internet and the CFPB database shows that this is a consistent issue with Wells Fargo as many users have made similar complaints. 


To summarize, there are three main issues involved in my situation. First, Wells Fargo is not graduating me from my secured credit card even though I have been consistently fulfilling all the requirements to qualify for graduation for years. Second, Well Fargo customer service not being able to give a reason why I have not been graduated yet. Third, Wells Fargo 's explicit refusal to open a case to investigate and resolve my issue."
1933,"I cancled all of my Wells fargo credit cards because they hounded me day and night about purchases.I went to my branch to do this and told the rep I wanted to pay off every card and cancel them all to avoid anymore calls or payments and I did or at least I thought I did, but XXXX kept sending me on line bills that I ignored, and they droped my score from XXXX to XXXX or so because of XXXX $ or so.My credit cards in fact all of my bills are on auto pay so they are never late and for XXXX to do this after over 20 years of being a customer I think is a kick in the face, so if they don't set this right, I'll be moving my direct deposits to another bank!

1938,"The company is Wells Fargo ( "" bank '' ). The dates of the transactions are XX/XX/2019. 

I have a credit card, debit card and a checking account with the bank. The credit card provides rewards a 1 % cash rebate. The debit card does not. The credit card automatically takes monthly payment from the checking account. 

In the afternoon of the 25th while I was purchasing an {$1100.00} item ( refrigerator and some installation and disposal services ) from XXXX XXXX on the internet, my credit card was rejected twice. I then purchased using the debit card. That night I spent {$230.00} at a restaurant in XXXX using the debit card. 

I asked the bank in two phone calls and four e-mails to credit both transactions for the 1 % rebate, and the bank refused. 

I could go to small claims court and get the money, but, of course, the amount is too small for the effort. This unfairness in remedy power is why the CFPB exists. 

I would win in small claims court under the facts further explained below. After purchases for XXXX up to the XXXX, the checking account had a balance of around {$30000.00}. I was transacting for the refrigerator using my iPad. If bank wanted to block my account for a security reason, it could have checked with me through calling me or instant messaging me. The bank did not. Instead, the bank first rejected the transaction ( first e-mail received after the rejection ) and then informed me there was a security question ( second e-mail received ). 

Was there a valid security reason? No. The amount should not trigger any issue given the above financial information. That the amount was for XXXX, rather than XXXX should not have bothered the bank because it should know that the largest electronics goods retailer records all its internet transactions as being from XXXX. Moreover, as an internet transaction, the bank ( and all banks ) should have a system to check whether the item is being physically delivered and, if so, where. If the delivery address matches the credit card address, the bank should know the purchase is valid. This should be a requirement as more transactions are done over the internet, and especially if a rewards program is involved. 

( This was the third time that the bank blocked my account needlessly. I suggest that banks should report to the CFPB how many times accounts are blocked and how many times those closings were wrong. Banks with too many wrongful blockings should pay substantial fines to the CFPB. ) So, I was on the internet. With my credit card blocked, I used the debit card of the same bank. What did the bank expect me to do instead? Did the bank expect me to stop my internet transaction to check my e-mail and then call the bank to go through their automated system to inform the bank of its error? Did the retailer likely paying the bank something for the transaction want me to stop transacting?"
1941,"I signed up for a Dillards credit card through Wells Fargo earlier in 2022. I have been receiving spam texts and calls, numerous times. Ive contacted customer service to pay my bill and explain my current work situation due to a car accident in XXXX of 2022, to no prevail. This credit card is hurting my credit and a breach of privacy, unknowingly selling my personal info."
1942,"This is my 2nd complaint with the cfpb about Wells Fargo for the same issue. There was fraud on my account. I did not commit the fraud or benefit at all from the fraud. Wells Fargo continues to refuse to give me more information about the transactions that occurred in regards to the time/date so that I can better prove that I did not commit these transactions. Wells Fargo 's response has been continually as follows : After careful review of our records, our Fraud Department 's review of your claim was denied, and as such, you are responsible for this account and it's balance. The company ( Wells Fargo ) did not contact me at all in regards to the additional documentation that I have provided them through 5 appeals, 1 x cfpb claim, etc. They continually rubber stamp my complaint as denied. I do not have the ability nor know what I can do next, and need help. I was told specifically that because they initially marked my fraud case as "" card stolen '' and that there was not a police report that they were denying the case. The police department told me that they do not take cases like this, since i'm not the party that lost the money. I was told that I had fraud protection on my account, and as such, I want the account balance to be waived. If you can provide me the time/date of the transactions, I can also submit additional information and proof of my own location at the time of the transactions to help prove that I was not party to those fraud transactions."
1944,"I have been a loyal customer and account holder with Wells Fargo for about 5 years now. On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a {$10000.00} secured credit card with them so they took a {$10000.00} collateral from my checking account. Since the day I opened this credit card account, I had paid on time and never missed a payment to this day. I never overcharged the card or went above the limit. In fact, over the past year I never really used the card for more than {$500.00} a month which I would pay in full at the end of each month. 

Finally, after 3 years, Wells Fargo decided to release the collateral and change the credit card account to an unsecured credit card. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from them stating that they would be depositing the collateral amount ( {$10000.00} ) into my checking account by XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately, that's not what happened. I did not receive my collateral by XX/XX/XXXX and they made me run after my money for three weeks for different excuses. Once, the check was lost in mail, another time one of the managers had forgotten to sign the check, and another time they had realized that not been able to deposit the collateral into my checking amount for some mysterious reason. I finally received the check 10 days late and after more than a dozen phone calls and follow ups. 

Furthermore, Mid-XXXX, after my credit card had changed to an unsecured card, I received a letter from the Executive Office of Wells Fargo, stating that "" to manage their risk '' they've decided to close my account. I then, called every single department I could speak to, including the Executive Office, but they did not provide me any proper reason to why they closed an account with perfect payment history, no late payments, no high utilization and etc. I Spoke with probably more than 20 representatives and spent more than 24 hours on the phone with them to get an answer, but I wasn't successful. 

I spend 4 years building history and a perfect relationship with Wells Fargo and had {$10000.00} of my hard earned money sitting with them as collateral to make sure that I built history on my credit report and all of a sudden they closed my account for no good reason. This is clearly a discriminatory act by Wells Fargo since I am from the XXXX. I have been a victim of discrimination by this financial institution and want others like myself to be aware of what they did to me. I dont want this to happen to any other lawful XXXX XXXX like myself who work hard in this country and pay taxes like any citizen."
1947,"I sent a debt validation letter in XX/XX/2019. I received a response in XX/XX/2019. The amount reflecting was updated from $ 200+ and reduced to {$150.00}. I in turn sent a letter requesting the debt be removed from my credit report in XXXX and I havent received a response. I did speak with someone at Wells Fargo and I was told the debt had surpassed the statute of limitations and no longer collectible. I was informed that I should receive a 1099-C for the debt. I have not received this document yet. We are in the process of trying to purchase a home and this debt is hindering me from repairing my credit. If I cant pay the debt, I need it to reflect closed and paid or settle or what may have you."
1948,"on XXXX20 someone pretending to be me called Wells Fargo and asked for a new credit card to be sent to a different address then mine. Wells Fargo granted this request and now a stranger ( I believe named XXXX XXXX ) has my credit card in his possession and used it at least 4 times with total charges of around XXXX dollars. Wells Fargo assisted in this extortion of my good credit and I am left to resolve all forthcoming issues on my own. This is totally outrages, No bank can be this stupid, phone and voice recognition ignored, no phone call or text to me which could easily conformed if it was me or not, this is something I must do constantly, so why was my imposter not put through the same procedures that I must go through? So what is Wells Fargo 's responsibility in this matter? As I am left to scramble to cover all my credit information. Wells Fargo as not called me on this matter, they have not apologized to me, they have not express any concern nor have I received a transcript of the phone call from XXXX20 to see what information was used to obtain a credit card in my name."
1950,"This is my XXXX attempt to correct this matter with Wells Fargo. I have spoken to Executive Office Managers, Customer Service managers and still the matter is not being resolved and now every right I have under the FCRA is being violated by Wells Fargo. 
***** The 30 Day last posting to my personal credit report for XX/XX/2022 is INCORRECT and at this time is it demanded that this be removed in swift fashion as Wells Fargo has now taken more than 90 days with incorrect investigations that have been conducted poorly with no resolution. 

It is very simple. The person ( s ) reviewing are using the payment due date instead of the billing cycle date. BILLING CYCLE is reported to the credit agencies. Not payment Due Date. If the person reviewing this new complaint will see that payment was received before the 30th day. I have reviewed this with Customer Service who also has noted payment for XX/XX/2022 was received before the 30th day of the billing cycle and therefore the 30 day late mark on my credit report is incorrect. But the Executive office reviewers are ignoring it. 

****** Attached will be two calendars that COUNT each day. From the payment date and the billing date. For XXXX and XX/XX/2022. PLEASE. Count the days. It is a very easy process to correct this matter.

I use the card to pay my rent and twice I have payed the rental company directly ( Cashiers Check ). But XXXX has made a rental charge on my account for the rent twice. So I pay directly to the company and XXXX charges me without my approval to my card. Who is stealing here? I have gone to the rental company 's management and they say I am up to date with payments and that there is no issue on their side. XXXX has also been charging me penalty fees which has added up. I have called XXXX 5 times and XXXX person could not help at all and the other 4 times I have been hung up on. This treatment and is unacceptable and how are they able to charge me for something that I have already paid for in cash???? I have emailed XXXX and waiting for response.

1960,Wells Fargo opened a credit card in my name without my permission. I want all accounts closed.
1962,"I was pressured into buying a XX/XX/XXXXhair piece for {$1000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX. I realized within a few hours after purchasing it that the hair was not what it was supposed to be. It would not stay in my hair, it did not match my hair color, and it could not be styled the way the owner claimed it could be. I realized it was not real hair, and that it was a product the owner manufactured herself. There were a lot of negative reviews online and a XXXX for the hair for {$190.00}. 

Since the store was already closed, my husband and I took it back as soon as they opened the next day at XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I was yelled at by the owner on speaker phone the store manager was holding. When I tried to talk to the manager, he stated he did not speak English. The owner refused to give me a return or an exchange. She continued to yell at me over the phone the manager was holding. I felt intimidated and scared, so my husband took the product out of my hand and left the product on the counter. We left the store and immediately called Wells Fargo for help ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX). I did tell the owner we were leaving it on her counter and the manager saw it there. I told Wells Fargo exactly what I did, and they never said I must get a refund receipt for proof. I only had the product for about 17 hours. Wells Fargo assured me they would take care of the situation. They acknowledged that I was not offered a refund or an exchange. Wells Fargo said they could stop the transaction from posting since it was still pending. I do not have the product now, but the store is falsely telling Wells Fargo they have no proof that I returned it on XX/XX/XXXX. Since it was left directly on their counter with their manager and the owner was told we were leaving it, one would have to assume they have the product, or the manager stole it. 

I felt confident Wells Fargo would reverse the charge. I started this claim with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. I did receive an email on XX/XX/XXXX stating Wells Fargo would investigate my dispute which may take up to 60 days. I continued to receive sporadic emails that Wells Fargo was working on my dispute and making progress. I called Wells Fargo around the end of XXXX, as I was about to make by 2nd credit card payment for XXXX. I wanted to know what the status of the claim was, since the emails all said that progress was being made. 

When I called, it was like I was telling my story for the very first time. Once again, the banking assistant assured me that Wells Fargo would help me with my claim. Then the emails started again about how progress on my claim was being made. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter and a form in the mail asking me to complete a Cardholder StatemenXXXX of Disputed Transaction and return it in 10 days. This should have been done back in XXXX. However, I immediately filled it out and emailed it back. On XX/XX/XXXX, two months after the initial claim was made, I got an email like I did on XX/XX/XXXX stating that Wells Fargo was working on my claim but that it may take up to 60 days to resolve me claim. The grand total would now be 120 days to resolve my claim. By law, a bank has 90 days to resolve a claim. Also on XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo gave me a temporary credit back of {$1000.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent the claims department another email checking on the status of my claim, as the 90 days from XX/XX/XXXX was up on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email stating that Wells Fargo had opened a claim for my case and would contact me in 10 business days, which would have been XXXX. I was called on XX/XX/XXXX, by Wells Fargo telling me that they would reach out again to the merchant that yelled and intimidated me to ask for a refund again since the merchant said no the first time. I told the bank assistant that I was certain the merchant would say no again, so what would happen then. The Wells Fargo assistant assured me that there were other options that Wells Fargo had to help me with the claim. On XXXX, I received another email that Wells Fargo was making progress on my claim. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a voicemail from XXXX at Wells Fargo stating that my claim was closed, I would be receiving some forms, and that I would now be rebilled. Three billing cycles and 113 days later Wells Fargo closed my claim by not taking care of me like they promised on XX/XX/XXXX and making me pay for a product I returned within 17 hours. When I called the claims department, I spoke with three different managers that all told me it was because I did not have a return receipt that Wells Fargo could provide to Visa. I asked to call Visa, and when I did, Visa told me that Wells Fargo decides who they give a courtesy refund to or not. Visa does not require a proof of return receipt from Wells Fargo. The last manager ( XXXX XXXX in the claims department then backtracked the Visa receipt story and said that without the receipt, Wells Fargo does not trust me. He also told me to be more careful of the places I shop at in the future. 

Wells Fargo took longer than 90 days to resolve this claim. Wells Fargo stated on XX/XX/XXXX that they would help me to reverse this charge. Wells Fargo should be held accountable."
1963,"Three years ago around this time Wells Fargo sent me a credit card that I never applied for. They opened a credit card in my name & sent it to me without my consent or authorization. However, I decided to keep the card because it earned cash back. But after 3 years I have only earn {$24.00} dollars in cash back. So I was informed not only by Wells Fargo Bank but a friend said that I can convert my current Wells Fargo credit card to another one that will earn rewards faster. When I tried to convert my current credit card into the other credit card product, Wells Fargo said my account was not eligible. I asked the Wells Fargo credit card specialist, "" why isn't it eligible? '' The Wells Fargo Rep said "" either you missed a payment, or you have exceeded your credit limit. '' I have never missed a payment on my card, I have never exceeded the credit limit on my card, and I always pay my card in full every month. My Wells Fargo Visa always has a XXXX balance, and Wells Fargo knows this. However my friend who converted his Wells Fargo Visa is always late on his payments, always goes over his credit limit, but Wells Fargo converted his card. Wells Fargo is unfairly singling me out for some reason. I spoke to many Wells Fargo reps and they do not seem to have an answer. Maybe because Wells Fargo fraudulently opened my credit card. I am so disappointed in Wells Fargo for their unethical practices. They never even apologized for opening a credit card in my name and running my credit without my consent. I should have sued 3 years ago. But I decided to keep the card. Wells Fargo now needs to make this right and offer me a solution. The solution should be converting this current card I have into another card that will benefit me more. That is the least Wells Fargo can do. It's not asking much considering that they opened this credit card in my name without my consent or authorization."
1965,"Hello There, I used to have a checking account and a secured credit card with Wells Fargo. I was not happy with the way Wells Fargo was handling my account and I decided to close all my accounts with Wells Fargo. 

I open the secured credit card as I was advised by Wells Fargo employee that will help me open my credit ; I have never had a credit card before and I open the secured credit card at their advised. I deposited XXXX and received a secured credit card. 

Sometime om 2017 when I close all my Wells Fargo Accounts at the bank the Banker that helped me closed the accounts even took my secured credit card and clipped she also said that I would not need the card since I was closing my accounts. 

Time went by and I applied for a mortgage and discovered that the card was showing on my report as open and reporting derogatory information on my credit report I hired an attorney to help me clear my credit and they made Wells Fargo return my security deposit however even though Wells Fargo acknowledge that they did not acted in a fair manner towards me. ; They still to this date have not clear the derogatory information on my credit. I called the executive office to put a complaint and the lady that took my call did not know anything about secured credit cards, she did not understand my concern and I have asked for a supervisor she said that she will escalate my concern. 
Weeks passed by and I received a letter from Wells Fargo telling me that after all this years they still need time to resolve my concern."

I asked for a number to contact XXXX at if for some reason she didn't get the message. The number given me was, XXXX - XXXX - XXXX. When dialed, a recording states the number is a non working number.

1978,"Why does the CFPB and the Federal Govt permit credit card companies from charging interest rates that many would consider to be usary? The Fed Funds rate is currently 2.5 % and the XXXX  Prime Rate is only 5.5 % while many credit card companies are charging rates in excess of 20 %. Is 14.5 % or more over prime really fair? Mortgage companies have rate caps to prevent usary, why not credit card companies? I've seen credit cards with rates >24 %. How can this be permitted?"
1979,"I have just been made aware of this situation. 
In XXXX, I purportedly had some overdrafts in my Wells Fargo checking account. Wells Fargo charged my ( Wells Fargo ) credit card for those amounts, despite the fact I had ( and continue to have ) a savings account with them. These changes are considered as a "" cash advance ''. 
I am still paying interest on those "" cash advances ''. 
I have discovered that the allocations of my monthly payment to my credit card balance is divided as follows : 7 percent is paid to these credit card "" advances ''. In retrospect, the remaining 93 percent is being paid to RECENT transactions I have made that either have a 0 percent interest rate or another modest rate offered at the time of that transaction. Again, the "" cash advances '' were made in XXXX. The transactions that the bulk of my payments are being allocated to, occurred in XXXX!! According to the bank, I've paid approximately half of the "" cash advance '' balance. This is nothing but a fraudulent business practice! The bank continues to collect interest against a 5 year old debt!! 
How much more despicable can Wells Fargo get??"
1980,"This evening on XX/XX/2022, I received a text message from Wells Fargo asking if I had made a purchase at XXXX for {$1.00}, and to call their customer service team if I did not make this authorization. 

I called and spoke with someone whose English was terrible. He couldnt speak English enough to understand the answers to my security questions ( or so he claimed ), and kept probing me for additional information that he again claimed was incorrect. The information I provided was correct. 

I got suspicious because the more he told me my answers were wrong, the more questions he was asking some of the questions are not pieces of information that I had ever provided to Wells Fargo. I am a fraud analyst, a certified fraud analyst. I know the interview questions and the laws and guidelines for fraud victims. I asked him at this point if he actually worked for Wells Fargo because his professionalism was terrible. He abruptly transferred me to someone else another person who did not speak English. This individual sat on the phone for a while pretending that he couldnt hear me and hung up. 

My card has been shut down. I doubt that Wells Fargo will reopen that card, which is going to hit my credit in a negative way. 

Being in the business, I know that Wells Fargo has been investigated by the CFPB for situations such as mine. 

What I found funny is that Wells Fargo did not attempt to forward this case to a fraud investigator or even show me any kind of humanity or compassion. I felt victimized by the bank who is insured to protect me. I dont even know if Wells Fargo did anything to protect my information because this appeared to be a breach on their end."
1983,"Wells Fargo and fraudulent debit card transactions. 

I noticed a number of debit transactions on my Wells Fargo checking account. I cancelled the card and reported the transactions. I rarely use this account and the transactions date back more than 60 days. I Understand that all transactions beyond 60 days are not usually returned. 

Wells Fargo credited my account for {$420.00} and {$13000.00}. The {$420.00} became final and then Wells Fargo alerted me to the larger dollar amount. I finally went through the account and found more charges to another vendor and reported an additional {$6400.00} I called to check on the {$6400.00} amount and Wells Fargo told me I withdrew the claim. 
They refuse to call back, email back or contact me in any way. 

The vendors are credit card processors for consumer-facing bitcoin sites with horrible online reputations. XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I filed a police report and a report with identitytheft.gov. I sent Wells Fargo the reports. 

I spoke briefly with the high dollar fraud rep who claims to have evidence proving it was me that made the charges, however, this was a debit card and the was never used. They said they would escalate my claim to the executive office. They did not and now they have debited me the {$13000.00}. 

The totally amount of fraud was over {$28000.00} with approximate {$10000.00} more than 60 days old at time of reporting. 

Please note the following : Claim numbers are XXXX & XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, to XX/XX/XXXX ( day before the first XXXX  transaction posted ) the account posted a TOTAL OF 114 TRANSACTIONS. 

XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, a total of 231 transactions. The only difference in the pattern is transactions to XXXX and XXXX The dramatic increase suggests fraud. The spending patterns do not in any way correspond to the account history From XX/XX/XXXX, to XX/XX/XXXX, ZERO transactions with either merchant, XXXX or XXXX. 

From XX/XX/XXXX, to XX/XX/XXXX, 151 Transactions combined between the two merchants XXXX & XXXX in the amount of {$28000.00} Thus the Wells Fargo conclusion that suddenly on XX/XX/XXXX, I decided to patronize two extremely disreputable Cryptocurrency merchants constantly for the next 93 days without a pin number for nearly {$30000.00} is not credible. At least 10 of these transactions occurred while I was not in the country or on an airplane. 

Wells Fargo claims I withdrew the dispute but it is Wells Fargo who are denying my credit. 

The people responsible for this mess are XXXX and XXXX.

1985,On XX/XX/2021 I reached out to Wells Fargo Bank to inform them of 2 fraud charges on my account. After several months of investigation I received a letter on XXXX XXXX stating that these fraud charges were vailed because I paid my bill.
1988,"To : Federal Trade Commission Consumer Financial Protection Bureau From : XXXX XXXX Department of Homeland Security XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. XXXX Re : Closed XXXX Account payments Fraud I XXXX XXXX XXXX under penalty of perjury solemnly attest that the statement included in the complaint is true. I opened a Wells Fargo Platinum VISA in XX/XX/XXXX. After falling on hardship due to medical conditions in XX/XX/XXXX I asked to be added to the hardship program which reduces the interest rate from 24 % to 6 % during a defined period of time thus reducing the liability shortly after learning about the account fraud committed by Wells Fargo or other atrocities for which Wells Fargo has become known. 
It is my belief Wells Fargo Platinum VISA has blocked web access for its credit card in an attempt to get customers to visit their branches and possibly create new business and be able to assess unwarranted fees to many of their customers by making modifications that prohibited on time payments. Wells Fargo granted the request but discontinued the program while I was XXXX to the XX/XX/XXXX Hurricane in XXXX  and XXXX XXXX and did not have access to my account number to reestablish web access and was unable to make payments or remain of the phone with customer service for hours trying to resolve a simple issue of making payment while responding to disaster survivor needs as an XXXX   XXXX establishing disaster relief centers. 
I contacted the customer service call center today and after a 20 minute wait finally got through to a representative. The representative informed my payment would be {$40.00} per month during a call in XX/XX/XXXX which I made in XX/XX/XXXX 15 days early I was told today XX/XX/XXXX that the payment was $ XXXX monthly and it was reported to the credit bureau as a late payment. I was also told that Wells Fargo blocks web access for account viewing ( https : //www.wellsfargofinancialcards.comXXXX ) only allowing access to payment website ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ). With the dynamic payment modification which Wells Fargo practices how am I supposed to know what the accordion style payment calculations will be if I am traveling and have no method of reading written correspondence from them nor viewing capabilities of the payment amounts due online. This practice of approximate fluctuating payment for consumer requested closed accounts in which the balance is decreasing since purchases can not be made has to be illegal and certainly unethical to myself and countless others. I was told that most of the calls they receive are regarding website access. 
After making a payment today the customer service representative informed me the payment will be approximately {$85.00}. 
While I am furious about these types of atrocities i am more concerned about how wide spread this may be generating millions for the bank and placing countless of victims at risk. I ask there be a full scale investigation into Wells Fargo especially with the unethical practices for which they have become known."

So I gave her my house number in which she said I could be identified by this number. However, I was on the road and could not get to the number so I suggested going into a branch. She said that for me to take two identification to a banker at one of the branches. I went into a branch in XXXX XXXX explained the issues gave my XXXX cdl license, US passports, and my Social Security card. However, this was not enough even though I had two previous account with them. I explained that these unnecessary procedures was due to my racial heritage.

2002,I'm a victim the inquiry issue with credit card 1. Wells Fargo SVC XX/XX/2020 2. XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2020
2003,"On the morning of Monday, XX/XX/2018, I logged into my Wells Fargo online banking account. I have noticed that my credit card balance seemed to be going up at an almost exponential rate. When I reviewed the online transactions closer, I noticed that every credit card transaction for months had been doubled. For example, monthly storage payments in the amount of {$300.00} were doubled, streaming TV subscriptions for {$29.00} a month were doubled, and store purchases were doubled. I have screen-prints and hard-copy printouts of the transactions ( attached ). 

As of this writing I have not contacted Wells Fargo yet, as these kinds of issues have been going on with Wells Fargo for years ( including switching my personal to a small business account ). I have informed Wells Fargo of past concerns and they have not taken them seriously - routinely diminishing and discrediting concerns. 

At this juncture, I can not trust Wells Fargo to act with transparency and integrity to fix this and other issues. I must wonder if this is the same type of "" computer glitch '' that has recently plagued Wells Fargo ( with respect to home loans ). 

I am asking the Federal Reserve and CFPB to take a long, hard look into Wells Fargo and their practices and most certainly a review of their computer coding/formulas is crucial at this point."
2004,Wellsfargo acct number XXXX XXXX XXXX. This bank has been applied my payments for XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX to the wrong account. I am willing to pay the amounts due and late payments.
2006,"LET ME BE VERY BLUNT. I have been a loyal & happy Wells Fargo customer, until this matter & how it has been ( NOT ) handled. Long story short, I have been paying DOUBLE the required payment by auto payments in order to retire the payment plans by the end dates. When I logged on to check my account in XXXX, in anticipation of making a final payment, I discovered that WF had charged my account almost {$2000.00} in deferred interest ( plus monthly interest ), effectively doubling the remaining balance due, all because of internal allocation. How can I possibly be charge so much interest, when the total payments to date well exceed the balance on the "" offending '' plan? Simple answer : IT SHOULD NOT!! I have spent a considerable amount of time with a Customer Service Rep who confirmed the error and that it would be resolved in a few days. That representative even refunded the "" monthly interest '' that was incorrectly applied. Fast forward to now, MY ACCOUNT STILL HAS NOT BEEN FIXED, and I have wasted countless hours on hold, spoken with at least 3 WF representatives, sent at least a half dozen emails, and wasted almost 4 WEEKS. WF has failed to respond by fixing the issue, or telling me why they can't. I understand being short staffed due to COVID-19, but this is so egregious and has gone on so long without resolution, that I am starting to feel quite abused and mistreated. This is not a hard fix if they would just do it, but clearly they do not see this as a priority. I need a swift resolution to this so I can make my final payment ( s ).

2007,"I FEEL SOME TYPE OF DISCRIMINATION TOWARDS ME FROM WELLS FARGO, BECAUSE I'M A XXXX FEMALE, WHO FILED A CLAIM AGAINST WELLS FARGO FOR CREDIT CARD FRAUD. THEY KEEP HAVING THE SAME PERSON CALL ME WHO OFFERS NOTHING TO HELP ME. WHERE IS MY JUSTICE.!!!!!!"
2008,"We called XXXX XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/ for help. They promised they would show up in 30 minutes and insisted on prepayment of {$240.00}. Unbeknownst to us, they switched us to a know scam company XXXX XXXX XXXX who charged our card. Over the next 2 hours we called repeatedly and were told each time "" 30 minutes '', but no one showed. Since I was stranded on the freeway late at night and a danger to others and me, the XXXX stopped and told me I had to have the car removed. He said he'd never heard of our Tow company and had the XXXX dispatch a tow truck, so we canceled our order. The XXXX which arrived in 21 minutes, changed the tire and inflated my spare. As they finished, a private vehicle with a XXXX XXXX decal showed up. The man ( inebriated ) said his buddy at XXXX called him to say he couldn't do the service and asked this man to show up instead ( just a private individual not employed by any tow company ). We have call and text logs, photos and testimonials of other customers similarly scammed. We received no service from XXXX, were put in danger by their inaction, and canceled the service before the person they passed us off on showed up. Wells Fargo violated their policies for handling disputes by failing to offer us an opportunity to respond to the merchants response or to provide any evidence to contradict. They did not inform us of any deadline to take further action ; later they relied on this secret deadline to deny further action. We simply got a letter summarily denying our claim."
2009,I used the Wells Fargo go for rewards program for the first time in the middle of XX/XX/2018. After arriving at the website on my mobile device I found charities that I wanted to contribute too. By mistake I clicked on continuously new order. I began getting more cards than what I thought I should get. I called Wells Fargo and they looked into my account and saw that I clicked on continuously new order. After hearing this I told the Wells Fargo representative I wanted that changed and a stop to the cards. That has not happened and I have since then called Wells Fargo again voicing my complaint and the cards kept coming as soon as todays date.I want the cards stopped and points used as of XX/XX/2018 returned to my rewards program account.
2010,On XX/XX/XXXX my credit was fraudulently ran without my permission or consent. I have been a victim of fraud and Identity Theft. On XX/XX/XXXX I signed up for XXXX XXXX because I have received several letters for credit that I had no knowledge of and to have a better understanding I needed to know what was reporting on my credit file. I immediately called the company phone number listed on the correspondence only to be transferred to and from numerous departments being left on hold and then the phone being disconnected but promised a transfer to someone who I can report this fraud. I am desperately seeking someone to help me with this matter because its obvious they will continue to ping pong with me because it isnt them and they probably could care less because the fraud is not happening to them and its not fair.
2012,"It has come to my attention that the financial department of Wells Fargo & Company, may not have the ability to loan its own money or money of its account holders. Notice the existing credit card agreement which am in question of the credit that was allegedly loaned. Please provide evidence of the money that was loaned to me for family and household purposes. Notice, repayment needs to be made only in equivalent kind. Notice, this be a matter of emergency. Notice, am demanding for the bill to be zeroed out each and every bill cycle upon lack of supportive documentary evidence."
2013,"I have been the victim of very serious and life-shattering fraud over the course of 2019 and have spent EVERY SINGLE NIGHT for the last 4 months on the phone with banks, creditors, bureaus and consumer agencies attempting to repair the damage. XXXX and other sources have confirmed that my Social Security Number, Cell Phone Number, Passwords & Emails have all been compromised. I am a confirmed victim of the XXXX and now XXXX XXXX breach- as well as several lesser known breach. Everytime I think I am finally making some headway- either a bank or the bureau decide to continue to destroy my entire families future. 

I apologize for the preface, but this has become quite the exhausting task and if it werent for the future of my family and my hope to see us in the home we were planning on buying 4 months ago when we had credit scores in the XXXX 's before all this began, I would have already given up. 

What I experienced with Wells Fargo was some of the most disgusting and soul-less handlings of a victim of identity theft I have ever seen. Aside from three months of being hung up on, harrassed with overly long and complicated verification checks that involved an 8 team member transfer AFTER I had already successfully verified my code word, numerous calls to their executive branch, having to resubmit documentation ( 2 police reports, an Identity Theft FTC Report, other Supporting Documentation ) over three times via fax, snail mail AND certified letter- I finally received a letter stating the investigation was complete and the fraud was found to be legitimate. 

I wish I could say that this is where my nightmare with Wells Fargo ended- Following the reinstatement of my funds, Wells Fargo continued to play games. They sent me three cards in a row over a months time that did not work- one with a CVV of all zeros and made me jump through hoops and endure another 15 nights/rounds of 5-hour long phone calls in an attempt to regain access to my SECURED CREDIT CARD funds. These are funds that I, in good faith and with the promise of the card turning into a secured card within a year ( THREE YEARS AGO UPON OPENING ) deposited as a means of building credit, were being held XXXX at what I can only imagine was a running joke and the head office. 

During one of these 5-hour phone calls one of their reps "" accidentally '' permanently turned off my brand new card which resulted in another week of waiting for the third XXXX. It was all truly unbelievable. From a dispute that began at the end of XX/XX/2019 to XX/XX/2019, I had finally received a working card and access to my funds. I made several payments and the card remained in good standing until XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/2019 I received a voicemail stating that a fraudulent transaction was attempted and to call to verify transactions. It turns out that multiple fraudulent transactions had occurred and thankfully were blocked. Meanwhile, I continue to receive them on some of my other credit cards. On XX/XX/XXXX I happen to check my accounts just before going to bed at XXXX and was horrified to see that Wells Fargo had reversed all of the credited back money that was stolen and overdrew my account by {$330.00}. 

Without even so much as a phone call, which after plenty of months to research, I am aware is a complete violation of the FCRA, they stole my money all over again like a thief in the night. When I called they hung up on me twice and then told me the fraud team was not in, however, it was strange as after again successfully providing them my codeword and answering all 15 other identifying questions successfully, the rep told me he had to bring fraud on the line to verify me before he could do anything. The Fraud Department ... that was there right now mind you- He patched a Fraud Rep in and I attempted to get some sort of answer but she cut me off- didnt even perform a verification and told the other rep to take me back. 

My credit reports and consumer reports are all frozen with fraud alerts on them. My family has to live in an 800 square foot apartment as were not able to secure our dream home due to our lives being stolen and Wells Fargo continues to try to steal my SECURED XXXX dollars and now is somehow claiming I owe 2 twice that amount. All phone calls have been recorded since day one and can be provided- they truly are just disgusting displays of a misuse of power andtotal disregard for our laws.. let alone completely lack any human empathy. I am truly in disbelief. I a writing the CFPB in hopes that you will hold them accountable for their actions- even if their isnt much that can be done for me- this has got to stop for hardworking families. I will now have to spend XXXX knows how long being hung up on and explaining and reexplaining and mailing and faxing to get my XXXX dollars back and will now forever live in fear that they will just take my money again. I hope the CFPB can assist. Thank You. 

With that said, I received a voicemail on XX/XX/2019."
2017,"I received a letter ( XX/XX/19 ) from WFFinancial Svcs. informing me that they are issuing me a CC with a {$5000.00} + cap. I loath WF  and would never apply to them for a CC. 
I tried calling Only one phone # for WFFinancial Svs. In XXXX XXXX, SD and call is never picked up ; continuous elevator music. There is no contact info in the letter for which to contact them. I did track down the issuing offices in XXXX XXXX. 
I do NOT want credit cards listed as mine. It reflects poorly on my credit, not withstanding that someone may have applied in my name/ stole my identity."
2018,XX/XX/2014 XXXX or more tried to resolve but no actions was given
2021,Try would keep my account 2 days behind so everything I did the day before would not come off till the 2nd and make me have overda every time for the last 2 3 years and if I did not US Wells Fargo ATM exter fees and they close account I setup for my grandkids and Idk how much that was and in all I lost my house
2024,"On XX/XX/2017 I was contacted by Wells Fargo Bank 's Fraud Department regarding an online purchase of over {$1500.00} in which I stated the transaction was not authorized and was fraudulent. Additionally, the WFB representative made me aware of 2 additional credit card transactions that occurred at 2 retail locations, one for {$540.00} and the other for {$490.00} on XX/XX/2017. I stated these were also not authorized and were fraudulent. The Fraud Department credited my account for the charges ; however, WFB sent me a letter stating that the charges were mine and that they would be my responsibility. Therefore the amounts were charged back to my credit card. I continued to state that they were fraud and I did not do them. They insisted I did since my credit card was present with the chip card used. I stated that chip cards could be duplicated ; however, they stood by their "" investigation '' of the card transactions and deemed them to be my responsibility. I called on multiple occasions to try to get my credit card fraud transactions resolved ; however, as of date, there has been no resolution. 

I filed a dispute with their Disputes Department in which they requested for merchant receipts. The Disputes Department verified the signatures on both merchant receipts were not a match of one another given the transactions were conducted within 15 minutes of each other and did not match the signature card on file. The Fraud Department had access to this information as of XX/XX/2017 and did not utilize this information into their "" investigation. '' I filed a complaint regarding the Fraud Department to the Credit Card Executive Office with no resolution to my problem as well. I had called and left multiple messages with no call back or information sent to me. I received a phone call from a Fraud Department supervisor who stated that the Fraud Department was not aware of the signature card or merchant receipt requests ; which validates, the Fraud Department did not do their due diligence in reviewing my fraudulent claim. Additionally, WFB did not know which authorized users card was used in these fraudulent transactions until I found out on XX/XX/2017. The Disputes Department gave me the supporting documentation for the merchant receipts. At this time my fraudulent claim was already denied by the Fraud Department twice. I later found out that new credit cards were issued and mailed to me and this is how the cards were intercepted and used in the fraudulent transactions. I notified WFB about this and they had no record that new credit cards were even sent to me. All within the time frame from the initial contact from WFB Fraud and various other departments from XX/XX/2017 through XX/XX/2017, I filed a police report with my local police department, a United States Postal Inspector report, a Cardholder Statement of Disputed Transactions letter that WFB sent to me, and the credit bureaus were contacted. I spent multiple days and hours trying to have this resolved and for WFB to know that these transactions were fraudulent and I along with the authorized signer on my card are victims of Credit Card Fraud. 

After numerous attempts in calling and submitting documents, I received a phone call from a Police Department outside of my jurisdiction that the Police Officer had in their possession my credit card. I verified with the Officer ( I contacted the Police Department upon giving the Officer information ) that the additional card holder 's card may be included as well that was used in the initial fraud transactions at the 2 retail locations. The Officer confirmed that the additional card holder 's card was also in their possession. WFB did in fact issue new cards which were used in the fraudulent activity and was in possession of someone who was not authorized to use my cards and who was arrested on multiple criminal charges. 

WFB did not protect my rights as a credit card fraud victim at all. It appears they would just like to charge their consumers for the fraudulent transactions without any due diligence in their investigations. The Fraud Department already was aware there was fraud on my account and had documents readily available to them to indicate fraudulent activity ; however, WFB continued to deny my claims."
2028,"My Bank is Wells Fargo since XXXX, My bank is giving me a hard time forward the incorrect information to the credit bureau that I was late in payment twice a time in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX which is wrong because my account was set up as a direct payment from my Wells Fargo checking account to pay my Wells Fargo credit care. The bank executive office supervisors/managers. From XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc. I am struggling from last two months spend a week from XXXX to XXXX pm on phone to resolve the issue.

2029,"I applied for a Wells Fargo credit card. A letter was sent to let me know the reason for the denial. I have a credit rating of XXXX and the reasons did not make sense. I immediately called them and to make a long story short, I did not anywhere with the bank bureaucracy. I wasted close to two ( 2 ) hours total with nothing done. There is something wrong and I hope you can help me get to the bottom of it. The irony, they offer a toll free number to call so the rating can be improved. See letter attached. There were also some comments that I reserve myself for future need."
2031,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I was trying to load gas into my vehicle, so I inserted my Wells Fargo Propel Card and it kept declining. I log into online banking and discover the phrase "" account is closed, please call xxxx '' for both my Propel card and Visa Signature card. I was flabbergasted and confused as to what had happened. I had to leave the gas station I was trying to load gas at with less than 10 miles in my tank ... I call Wells Fargo and they just give me the run around with no real help. Not to mention they removed the 57,000+ points I had Go Far Rewards account that I EARNED..Wells Fargo has proven time and time again that they are scumbags who deceive and undercut customers.. Both my credit cards have ALWAYS been paid IN FULL. XXXX I even paid too much by accident once ... and this is how my kindness and professionalism is repaid?! It is good to know that Wells Fargo doesn't appreciate customers that pay in full and would rather egg on the customer who is having trouble to pay his bills in full, so they can charge them an exorbitant amount of interest ..."

The scammers somehow knew that I had cancelled the card, so I immediately received a text yesterday telling me that they were from XXXX XXXX to help with the problem. I got on the phone with them, and gave them several pieces of information before realizing that it was a scam, and I hung up. The name they used was "" XXXX XXXX, '' and since then, today I got some emails from them saying that they just needed some more information for my credit card information. I did not open the emails. The name XXXX was in the subject line again. I permanently deleted both email accounts today."

2037,"On XXXX of 2022. My card was charged for the amount of {$XXXX} and then XXXX weeks later it was charged again for {$XXXX} From the same company ( XXXX XXXX ) I have contacted Wells Fargo when I saw the first charge and informed them that my card was stolen. Yet a charge poped up out of no where and they should have have block these transactions. 

They promised they fixed the issue. Then like I mentioned XXXX weeks later, another charge poped up. 
I called and waited on hold for hours. I was transferred from department to department and they themself seem to not know how to fix or even understand whats going on. I have been a customer of wells since I was in middle school. Never ever filed a fraud or dispute in my life. Never been late to a payment all these years. Yet they are treating me like this. 

I have explained that they can check my credit history, I never purchase from XXXX XXXX like ever. The closet store is hours hours away from me. 

They declined my statement and send me a letter saying that am the one made these payments. Even tho I have provided evidence showing I have not made these. This is outrages and unacceptable"
2039,"Please be advised credit card used was an XXXX XXXX XXXX  card.After reviewing wells fargos response they pretty much proved my point that they did not review my documents /complaint. They only responded to one of the many issues which was me signing receipt, without taking into consideration they held my furniture not once but twice for ransom ( Extortion ). They totally neglected the rest of the issues registered in my complaint and performed a half XXXX investigation. 

I previously submitted documents showing patterns of what these fraudulent moving companies do. They obviously totally disregarded it. Florida is the biggest scam state in the country especially due to a tremendous amount of senior citizens retiring here. Im sure Iowa where Wells Fargo executive consumer office is located is obviously clueless to the different issues that arises in Florida. The alleged investigators at wells fargo shouldve had an easy time with this investigation because I supplied all documents and research for them. All they had to do was look at it. 

One of the main pictures I sent in with the truck door being opened says it all! This was a disgraceful fraudulent company XXXX XXXX. A picture says a thousand words! 

Again, their were three transactions made. The first a {$50.00} deposit which wells fargo agreed with me on and returned. The second one was {$860.00} which was giving to me once door of truck was closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I refused to pay it as all creditable moving companies give you a bill on delivery. Driver called office and stated to him if I dont pay it they will not deliver my furniture. EXTORTION! What would you do? I had no choice and it was XXXX on a Friday night and I had to get a hotel room for weekend because moving company did not live up to their verbal commitment they made with me that move would only take five hours and I had no furniture. That is why I had to sign agreement. It was like someone putting a XXXX to your head. I immediately notified wells fargo XXXX XXXX  of situation and noted on invoice my displeasure with company and noticed all kinds of disclosures where basically moving company is not responsible for everything you can think of, damage, delays, etc. That was the first time I saw any of that XXXX  after my furniture was on truck with door closed. What credible moving company would state that. Everything was pretty much arranged over the phone. If I saw that stuff previously that would have raised a red flag and I would never have used them. I also asked if I was going to be charged anything else on Monday and they stated no. 

Well comes XX/XX/XXXX two other knuckleheads show up and demand more money {$280.00}. Of course I am fuming now and refused to pay so they call office and is told unless I pay do not unload truck. EXTORTION Again! What choice did I have? And keep in mind that was another invoice. Documents that was sent to wells fargo by moving company showing my signature were from two different invoices and they tried to scam wells fargo ( which it worked ) was one invoice. I signed it and noted my displeasure again meanwhile they opened door to truck picture previously submitted and I was in shock how truck was loaded. Furniture wasnt covered, property scratched, broken glass, couches ripped, art damaged, beds broken, etc etc. I was distraught and shocked beyond belief. I took pictures and video of everything and these two degenerates dripping sweat and dirtying my uncovered mattresses and other property. They also did not put back together what previous two guys took apart. I tried calling moving company XXXX XXXX numerous times but they obviously have caller ID and would not return my calls. I notified Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX  and made complaint which they agreed with me.

So now I contacted two separate attorneys for guidance and they both basically said the same thing. Contact credit card company ( which I did right away ) They also looked up company and they did not have proper license to be doing moving in the state of Florida. One of my attorneys had the Florida Attorney General call me XXXX XXXX because they were conducting a number of investigations of fraudulent moving companies in the state of Florida. XXXX was great and advised me to submit complaints to a number of different agencies which I did. I also notified our local XXXX investigates as they were doing a story on fraudulent moving companies and basically one of the stories was similar to mine where the moving company tried to extort a senior citizen and kept her property for months. Both my attorneys also advised me we could start a lawsuit against the moving company but I would just be throwing good money to bad because even if we win a judgement ( which was no doubt ) company would just close and open under another name and I would have thousands of dollars in attorney fees. Where can you find two honest attorneys? Both attorneys also advised me to submit claim to my home owners insurance which I did but after a few months of wasting time it did not fall under their perils. Also keep in mind I had to stay another week at the hotel stemming from the damage to my automatic beds and I have a bad back. 

So getting back to my issues. XXXX XXXX advertises ( documents previously submitted ) Professional movers with at least five years experienced and trained, which obviously just looking at the truck picture says it all. And they get drug tested. Three of the four guys looked like they came from a mens shelter and the other one was a XXXX ( probably illegal immigrant ) part of the family. Two of the three guys it was their first and last day with company as they too were disgusted how company operated and the other one left after the first day too for same reasons. All lies! 

They were supposed to carefully wrap furniture either in bubblewrap and or blankets. Again I refer to picture. 

They were also supposed to reassemble what was taking apart. They did not. 

Company was also supposed to be licensed and insured. They never sent information over to me and did not take my calls. I especially wanted their insurance information. Their was thousands of dollars in damages of my property. 

They took my information over the phone including my inventory. I also informed them of time restrictions at both properties and pickup location I lived on the fifth floor and elevator was involved and I informed them I had to leave a deposit and had elevator padded. Of course they are in denial I informed them of elevator. By the way girl I spoke to basically dropped the ball and is to be a family member/girlfriend. I also want to state they knew my apartment was XXXX clearly meaning Im on the fifth floor so deny about the elevator is a total lie. After we went over inventory the girl stated it would only take two guys about five hours. I disagreed and wanted three guys but she insisted she knows what she is doing and two guys would be good. I even joked around with her and stated if they dont get done I would be staying with her.

Of course day of the move two guys get to my place late I might add and they stated I wasnt going to be happy. Number one they came with a small truck and they also agreed with me they needed another guy. One guy called office and spoke with my same girl XXXX and she said just make two trips because they make more money. He was embarrassed, I was shocked but couldnt cancel because I had to be out of location because new owners were coming next day to paint. So again Im stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

After all these issues occurred I did a further investigation on these scam/fraudulent moving companies and discovered they all use a lot of the same tactics. Fraud, Extortion etc etc. I even submitted it to wells fargo to make their investigation easier. I must have submitted over one hundred documents to prove my case. And their answer is well you signed the receipt. Another words thats the only issue that mattered and they totally disregarded all the other issues/evidence. 

This to me is a disgrace and I do not understand how a bank like wells fargo can get away with this total disregard for consumer services. How can they not understand I had no choice in the matter. On top of all this wells fargo was I guess hacked and scam artist got my personal information resulting in me receiving scam emails with the wells fargo logo. Which I reported. I am totally disgusted with this bank and ow they can treat their clients like this.

Wells fargo dropped the ball and paid the merchant without my approval and allowing me to submit further evidence in the case showing they were being scammed by the company too by documents moving company submitted. They combined two different invoices. Their were three different transactions related to one case. Their was many issues but they only addressed one and totally disregarded the others. 

At this time Im only requesting that they zero out my account and repair my credit report they damaged as I refuse to pay a fraudulent company. How could wells fargo treat their clients like this. I had excellent credit before this matter and now they damaged that over nonsense and negligence on their part to actually read my evidence. And I find it amusing to try and cover their XXXX they respond to me with different representatives like their going to go against each other. Then another ridiculous issue they tell me to take this matter up with the merchant. They already paid him do you think he cares? Its a scam company. What a joke! What nonsense! What ever happened to protecting the consumer? 

Please cross ref this complaint with XXXX  XXXX  with complaint related to Wells Fargo # XXXX submitted on XX/XX/XXXXsince it was an XXXX XXXX XXXX  card"
2040,"I had someone scam me and take over my account and transfer over XXXX $ from my credit cards. Due to this all my credit cards have been closed because I am a XXXX  and am unable to pay this debt with the growing interest. I tried speaking multiple times with Wells Fargo and they denied my claims. In their reports they have the phone number that scammed me, they knew the person lived in XXXX XXXX, AZ and they did not return the money that was charged. Wells Fargo ruined my credit. They returned a small amount of the XXXX but with interest I can not pay and they closed all accounts to tell me there is no further research they can do to refund the money or reopen the credit card that they rightfully closed. If I was a senior citizen or had more money in my account they would have returned the money to me but since I was a XXXX I was unable to get the money that was taken in cash advances off my credit cards. I tried my hardest to resolve the situation but this is my last resort. I really need help this is unfair to ruin my credit when it was a hacker who used XXXX to send cash advances overseas and wire advances to names that are hard to pronounce. The hackers told me they would take a cash advance to give to their sons and then would send me a fake check to deposit that would help me also pay for my career and a new car. At the time I needed one and was attempting to start an XXXX XXXX and believed this person to be a sponsor."
2042,"Wells Fargo allowed someone named XXXX XXXX XXXX to open a finance account with XXXX XXXX using my ein number. This lady resides in XXXX XXXX. The only reason I was able to find out, is that I was trying to use the online banking services. Then the banker told me that there is a duplicate profile using my Ein number. With further investigation the name of the individual is above. The date I found out about this was XXXX XXXX. This means I do not know how long this individual was using my credit."
2044,"XXXX XXXX opened a line on credit in my name without my consent. Some of my information was used but since they didn't get permission they did have the wrong name ( not my legal name ), and incorrect address. 

Luckily no money was used from the opened line of credit and I contacted the institution which was managing the account, Wells Fargo, and I was able to identify the faulty information as proof and ( 1 ) closed the account, and ( 2 ) submitted a complaint via their institution to try and expunge from my credit report the inquiry for this line of credit. 

I am submitting this complaint incase this is a practice this company has and wanted to ensure, if this is a patter of behavior, others are not made victims too."
2048,My husband XXXX opened this account and added me as an authorized user. I am not financially responsible for this account and now that it charged off its hurting my credit.
2049,"My Name is XXXX XXXX, I receive my child support put on a "" XXXX '' WELLS FARGO XXXX. The Bank charges inquiries on the balance of the child support card of {$1.00} by ATM, so I stopped requesting atm balance inquiry several years ago. I know that WELLS FARGO Customer service charges XXXX per phone call to customer service. They offer 3 customer service calls per month free of charge. So, I very rarely, call customer service - except for lost card circumstances. Which has happened twice in the past 7 years, I lost my card. and they replaced it. Wells Fargo would have charged fees on those accounts as well. 

I have been receiving child support for 15 years, as I have XXXX children. I have been using the automated system for my balance inquiry as I have {$170000.00} in child support arrears and I rely on the child support agency to collect the funds by bank and or wage garnishment. and sometimes my balance fluctuates. I use the automated inquiry system to make sure what I am purchasing does not get overdrawn. 

Wells Fargo never mails out any debit card statements by mail. I rarely, go one line to check the activity. Recently, I had reason to check my balances and history, as I had XXXX request evidence of the child support deposits into my account which I cashed through the ATM machine. To my surprise, I have been charged numerous times for balance inquiry XXXX per transaction for over 10+ years. I read the disclosures, no where does it state that when a child support recipient calls through the automated system to check balance inquiry they will be charged XXXX as if they are speaking to and calling customer service agent. 

This is very sad, and unreal. There are so many single parents who are struggling. and Wells Fargo as big as they are, charging for a automated balance inquiries under phone number XXXX. I've been a Wells Fargo customer for over 15 years at the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX location, there is no reason for excessive fees nor automated inquiry fees. 

The statement online customer service number for inquiry charges is XXXX always states your call can not go through, please try again or hangs up on you."
2051,"A credit card was opened in my name, without my knowledge some time in 2012 after my father and I visited a local branch and opened a student checking and savings account when I started college. I'm told this was done on line and that it was used for on line purchases. What complicates things is my father 's cell phone was used to set up the account and when he got calls and bills in the mail he made minimum payments thinking he was helping me. when I told him I never had a card he stopped. At that time, we began calling and writing to get this resolved. We have been unsuccessful and Wells Fargo isn't being forthcoming."
2053,My card hacked many types and charged many times with unwanted fees
2057,"Wells Fargo Bank is reporting 2 fraudulent accounts on my credit reports. I have disputed these accounts several times and they were removed from my credit report. Wells Fargo is now re reporting them and is refusing to remove them. I have sent supporting documents proving these are fraud. They sent me documents claiming I made purchases the suppose signatures are not mine and or no where near my Signature!!!! I am able to send in documents showing my signature is totally different! I have sent police reports ID THEFT AFFADVITS and FTC complaint forms. Wells Fargo is not working with my at all in trying to resolve this matter. The following are the accounts that are fraud. 
1.Account Name WF BANK NA Account Number XXXX Date Opened XX/XX/XXXX 2.Account Name WF/XXXX Account Number XXXX Date Opened XX/XX/XXXX They need to look at the signatures because the signatures do not match mine."
2058,"On XX/XX/2022 I purchased a computer XXXX from XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX it was marked "" Signed for by someone at the front desk/receptionist. '' and marked delivered. The problem is it was shipped to my private residence. Which has no front desk or receptionist, nor is it a gated community. It is a single family home. After trying to work with XXXX for a refund they refused so I issued a dispute with my Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX card. This is after XXXX had not problem refunding me for another package for a lesser amount marked delivered in the same way on the same day. 

I spoke with the Wells Fargo representative that told me since XXXX failed to collect a signature from me, this would be a simple dispute. Fast forward to last week Wells Fargo called me to tell me my dispute is denied. They said XXXX provided proof it was delivered. I asked for what proof as there was no one home, no photo taken as XXXX usually does, no signature provided. They told me the proof was the delivery driver said it was delivered and to contact the police or the Attorney General. This makes no sense? They will blindly accept XXXX  word over protecting their customers? 

XXXX has informed me they issued a refund to Wells Fargo in XXXX, and that it is now their responsibility. Wells Fargo claims they provided proof and now I do not have my XXXX or the XXXX $ I paid for it.

I went through all the hoops XXXX asked for, even providing police ( Sheriff in my case ) reports they claimed to require for refund, until they finally demanded an online link to the report as my copy was not good enough, but the Sheriff does not have an online system for reports. I have provided all of this to Wells Fargo."
2059,"On XX/XX/2021, Wells Fargo was contacted to let them know about unauthorized transactions on my credit card. They opened up a dispute and on XX/XX/XXXX, they denied to resolve the claim in my favor. With advertisements that state "" you are not responsible for any unauthorized purchases made on your card '' it is misleading to the customer that the bank will protect the interests of the cardholder in the event the card is used for an unauthorized transaction. 

The following transactions are the ones that WellsFargo has refused to resolve : XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXX, $ XXXXClaim NumberXXXXStatus : Temporary Credit Transaction, XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXXAmount XXXX $ 414.89Claim Number,XXXXStatus : Closed - Dispute Declined Transaction, XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXXXXXXAmount, $ XXXXClaim NumberXXXXStatus : Closed - Dispute Declined Transaction, XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXXAmount, $ XXXXClaim Number,XXXXStatus : Temporary Credit Transaction, XXXX XXXX XXXX CA XXXXAmount, $ XXXXClaim Number,XXXXStatus : Temporary Credit Anyone with eyes can see that this is suspicious activity. I have had this card for over a year and I make purchases all the time with it. It is not difficult to see a customer 's spending habits, where they spend, how much they spend etc etc. Needless to say, this spending is unusual and should have been flagged by their fraud prevention team. 

The reason for denial is because I have made purchases with this merchant before. ANYONE who has ANY XXXX products, will have made a purchase with XXXX. But i spend $ XXXX/mo on subscriptions. Not {$2500.00}!"
2062,"Please reference attached email/letter communication w/ Wells Fargo Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX 

I received a credit card solicitation from Wells Fargo Bank in XXXX and responded by completing an online application for the same shortly thereafter. Wells Fargo acknowledged receipt of the application via email on XX/XX/XXXX ( copy attached ). Based on the bank 's XX/XX/XXXX response ( copy attached ), the "" We need to verify a few pieces of information before we can give you a credit decision '' statement included in same entailed the need to have my XXXX Credit Report Freeze lifted. 

Upon receiving notice that the XXXX Credit Freeze had been lifted, the bank initiated review of my credit card application and allegedly rejected it based on the following : Serious delinquency Too few accounts currently paid as agreed Proportion of balances to credit limits on revolving accounts too high Non recent non-mortgage balance information Since I have ready access to my XXXX Credit file, I took the liberty of revisiting it in response to the reasons listed above for non-approval of my credit card application. And while this laundry list may have served as a legitimate basis for rejecting prior credit card applications, based on review of my [ squeaky clean ] XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Credit Report ( summary copy attached ), it fails at doing so this time. 

Since Wells Fargo is well aware of my XXXX Dispute settlement [ which served as the primary basis for rejection in the past ], I asked the bank to advise detailed explanations w/ specific credit report examples of the infractions alleged in the list above. Although the bank has acknowledged my request, the promised response has remained outstanding for more than 30 days. As such, this complaint filing is the first of three ( 3 ) advised in my XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo Credit Card Application Letter ( copy attached )."
2066,"I opened a new account with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX with a balance transfer request to XXXX of {$7000.00}. I was told the balance transfer would get to XXXX on or before XX/XX/XXXX. Which was perfect as my cycle closed XX/XX/XXXX. I continued to contact WF by chat almost daily and was told the same. As the date was closer, it changed to 10-15 business days from when the funds are released. Then today changed to XX/XX/XXXX ( claiming that is 10- business days since XX/XX/12 ). 

I was a Credit Card XXXX for 25 years so I know how important terms and phrases are so I clarified at each transaction. I made the minimum payment to ensure I did not fall deliquent. I have now incurred interest charges and daily continuing interest due to misinformation provided by Wells Fargo. 

On three occasions, I requested escalation and to speak to a manager. Only on the XXXX request was I told someone from the XXXX XXXX would reach out within an additional 2 days. Wells Fargo has not learned from the errors of their past and continue their deceptive practices. I should not be accountable for these fees after confirmning business vs. calendar days on multiple instances. Then the date changed from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 

My request is to have this balance transfer be processed immediately and be reimbursed for interest accrued on the XXXX card. Had I been given proper information, I could have made changes on my end to ensure I was not accrusing interest. 

I am reporting this as I am certain this is happening to others and others may not be as well versed in banking and credit cards as I am."
2069,"I notified Wells Fargo back in XX/XX/XXXX of a purchase in XX/XX/XXXX that was never fullfilled in the amt of {$28000.00} and that I would like them to charge back that amount. in XXXX I called to check on the status still nothing. Called back in XXXX the representive told me they issued a temporary credit to my card, except the card the issued the credit was replaced by them months ago. I asked is they could just transfer the money to my checking account after several ( 2 ) hours on the phone I was told that was not an option. So I asked if I could then have it sent to my current card and they said it would take a few days. It's been 3 weeks and the last person I talked to XXXX XXXX XXXX lied to me on the phone, promised to call me back and the lied about that as well. Wells Fargo has been totally a nightmare to work with on this."
2070,"This is a Wells Fargo credit card which was advertised as awarding XXXX points after spending {$3000.00} within the first three months. The account was opened in mid-XXXX*. The account was opened by calling the XXXX # in the advertisement. From the onset of our conversation I told the representative I wanted the card which offered me XXXX upon spending the specified amount. I repeated that several times during our conversation to ensure I was signed up for the correct account. 

*I called Wells Fargo today to ask the date the account was opened and was told that information is confidential and can not be disclosed to me. 

I began using the credit card issued by Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2019 and by the end of the first cycle ( XX/XX/2019 to XX/XX/2019 ) {$2100.00} had been charged. That balance was due on XX/XX/2019 and it was paid in its entirety on time XX/XX/2019. By XX/XX/2019 the {$3000.00} threshold was already exceeded. The statement for the period of XX/XX/2019 to XX/XX/2019 showed a balance of {$3200.00}, which is not due until XX/XX/2019. 

Upon receiving my second statement, on or about XX/XX/2019 I noticed the bonus Reward Points were not on the account. In fact, NO REWARD POINTS were posted to the account. On XX/XX/2019 I contacted Wells Fargo and was told I DID NOT HAVE A REWARDS CARD. 

The Wells Fargo representative was told that at the time I opened the account I emphasized several times during our conversation that I wanted the card which awarded XXXX points after {$3000.00} were charged to the account. The representative "" created a case '' and gave me Case # XXXX and the XXXX # at the "" Corporate Office '' that handles these problems. The XXXX # I was given was : XXXX. Further, I was told someone from that office would be calling me to resolve the matter. 

No calls from the "" Corporate Office '' were received for several days. Therefore, on XX/XX/2019 I contacted the toll-free number provided for the office within the "" Corporate Office '' that was handling the problem. The representative reviewed the note by the person who spoke to me the day I requested the credit card and he said the notes stated that "" the customer is requesting a rewards card ''. Nevertheless, he told me it had to be further investigated in order to correct it. Someone would have to listen to the recordings of the telephone conversation between the representative who opened the account and I. At that point I asked why it would be necessary, since he had just told me the representative 's notes said I had requested a Rewards Card. He stated it was protocol. Nevertheless, he told me I would receive a call from a representative by the close of business. 

The close of business came and went and no return call. Therefore, I contacted this so-called "" Corporate Office '' on XX/XX/XXXX. This time the representative simply went over the notes inputted into the system and told me somebody would call me back. This time he refused to give me a time frame. 

Yesterday, XX/XX/2019 at XXXX hours CST I again called the "" Corporate Office '' the person who I spoke told me the case had been assigned to a Case Worker by the name of "" XXXX '' and that "" XXXX '' had called me yesterday at XXXX hrs CST, but there were no notes regarding the conversation. I told him I never received such a call yesterday and that my phone did not show a missed call yesterday. Nevertheless I told him I would call later to speak to "" XXXX. '' Finally yesterday I was able to speak to "" XXXX '' who said he was waiting for someone to review the recordings of the conversation between the representative and I. I asked "" XXXX '' why this was necessary since the representatives ' notes indicated I had requested a Rewards Card. "" XXXX '' said he could not see such a comment inputted into the system by the representative who opened the account for me over the telephone. This is totally contrary to what I was told by the representative who spoke to me the very first time I spoke to this so-called "" Corporate Office ''. 

Again, "" XXXX '' would not give me a time frame to resolve this matter. I asked him if this is something which happened often and he said he couldn't disclose that information. 

It is a known fact that Wells Fargo has engaged in illegal and/or unethical practices in the past. In fact, when I XXXX  "" Well Fargo Scams '' yesterday there were pages and pages of different schemes utilized by Wells Fargo which were deceptive and some outright illegal. Some of them led to substantial fines. 

Thus, there is reason to believe this a case in which the customer is offered one service and is provided a different one. This is nothing other than the old and proverbial method of "" BAIT AND SWITCH ''. In other words, the customer enrolls in one type of credit card and is given another one which does not provide the benefits the customer anticipated and the main reason he had requested it."
2075,"Since XX/XX/2016 the Bank charge me for almost eleven months : - XXXX XXXX   {$39.00} - XXXX  {$97.00} As a retired woman I programed my electronic monthly payments in {$70.00}. 
One day I received a letter that I was behind and my new payment increased to {$240.00}. 
For more than 4 months I talked to them back and forth, finally they response telling me that they can reimbursement only the last 3 months and that it is. So I started talking with the companies involved and they were agree to talk to the bank to reimbursement but the bank making adjustment as XXXX or XXXX, XXXX and XXXX I can not to follow them. 
The Bank did not want to decrease my debt in order to continue with my regular payment of {$70.00}. 
They insist to increase my monthly payment to XXXX so I closed my credit card and stop to make a payment and they continue with interest charge for purchases for {$51.00} monthly."
2076,"I was notified of fraudulent charges on my account. After closing and opening a new card it became evident that Wells Fargo authorized someone unknown to me to add themselves to my card. I have spent many hours in local branches verifying my identity as well as many hours on the phone. I was given my final account balance at which time I paid it with a cashiers check and was told my account was closed. All online access and statements were terminated. A new balance of {$1500.00} has materialized and I am being asked to pay it. It appears as if my cashiers check was applied to the fraudulent charges, and legitimate charges I was told I paid off were transferred to the fraudulent credit card, which they are now trying to get payment for a second time. My claim was denied due to the fact that payment came from a legitimate bank account ( I can't control where they apply a cashiers check ). I have been given two names of WF employees in the executive offices who will not return my voicemail messages. I have been asking for an accounting of payments and charges between all accounts real and fraudulent and have been denied this information. Nor can WF branch employees gain access to these amounts. In short, I've paid my balance, they applied my payments to fraudulent charges and refuse to close my account as promised. A police report was filed at the time the unauthorized person was added to my account against the advice of WF employees."
2078,WELLS FARGO TRYS TO SOLICIT ME A CREDIT CARD USING MY NAME WITH THE SOLICITATION AND WAS TOLD SEVERAL TIMES TO OPT ME OUT AND CAN NEVER DO IT BECAUSE THE SOLICITATION IS ANOTHER NAME OTHER THEN MY SELF WHICH I BELIEVE ITS MY SONS NAME ON THE CARD. THEY WERE TOLD NUMBERUOUS TIMES TO TAKE MY NAME OFF THIER SOLICITAION OR OPT OUT WHEN SENDING THE SOLICITATION TO MY ADDRESS WHICH I HAVE NO RELATION SHIP WITH WELLS FARGO BANK! WHEN ASK TO STOP USING MY NAME OVER 6 TIMES IN A 4 MONTH PERIOD NEVER SEEMS TO STOP THIER PRACTICE AND CONTINUE TO USED MY NAME ON THE APPLICATION SOLICITATION WITH OUT MY AUTHORIZATION FOR THE 10 TIMES IN 6 MONTHS I ASK THEM TO STOP THE PRACTICE. ID THIEF IS ONE OF THE FASTEST MOVING CRIMES IN AMERICA AND I DO NOT WANT TO GET ON THAT LIST!
2079,"Regarding Wells Fargo card account number XXXX On XX/XX/2020, I called the creditor in reference to the above account regarding the debt that I owed them which was on my credit report. I reached an agreement with Wells Fargo to settle the account for XXXX which I gladly paid at the local branch as I needed proof of payment. Wells Fargo has not kept their end of the agreement in that they failed to provide written notification on the account status to me and to the credit bureaus. The file in question continues to report negatively on my credit report which is at this time affecting my ability to purchase a home. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called Wellsfargo to follow up on the letter and the agent informed me that the letter will be in my hand on XX/XX/2020. 

Today on XX/XX/XXXX, I placed another call to WellsFargo as a courtesy follow up as they have not kept their end of the agreement, their agent XXXX stated that the letter can only be faxed or sent out via US Mail and I questioned him about having the letter sent over via secure email after which he could not answer the questions that ensured. He then transferred me to their Executive Office representative by the name of XXXX who stated that they would open a case file and rectify the matter by XX/XX/2020, which is way too late as it will hinder my closing. 

On XX/XX/2020 @ XXXX, I received an email from a XXXX who stated that she was the one assigned to handle the case and when asked about when the letter would be made available and why the payment has not been reported to the credit reporting agencies she did not have an answer for me instead she stated that she has until XX/XX/2020, which is not going to work as the terms of the agreement were that they would have the information updated by XX/XX/2020, which as since passed at this time. 

This is an urgent matter which Wells Fargo needs to resolve."
2080,"Went to XXXX XXXX branch ( XXXX ) of Well Fargo. XXXX refused to take a cash payment for credit card. She stated the card presented was a "" debit card ''. She confirmed with another teller it was a "" debit card ''. Finally after 14 minutes on XX/XX/2020 at XXXX XXXX  after customer asked at least 3 times to make a "" payment '', finally she processed a {$35.00} cash payment. No apology from XXXX to customer whom she disrespected, but a lame "" my bad '' to the teller who she mis-informed in transaction by calling card a "" debit card ''. 

This is at least the 2nd time WF employees assume the transaction that needs to take place instead of listening to the customer request. The employees are not trained to know banking terminology or customer services to customers. 

Need to Know your customer better!! This is a training problem at Wells Fargo. Customers are suffering due to assumptions/discrimination against customer and non-customers of the bank lobby. This has developed over time due to the cash restrictions on deposits for non=account holders."
2081,I had my Wells Fargo credit card stolen from me and fraud committed on it. I have left several complaints and it hasn't been resolved. I filed a police report in the matter when the fraud was first realized as well. Wells Fargo isn't working with me in any way. Two weeks ago when I checked on my account with Wells Fargo is was closed with a XXXX  balance. Now I just recently checked on it because I see my credit score has dropped by 25 points and Wells Fargo reopened the account at a negative balance cause of the fraud amount. THIS IS 100 % FRAUD and I made a police report and reported it with Wells Fargo right away. It was my impression that I'm not responsible for Fraud yet when I spoken to Wells Fargo directly they say that YES I am. This is not right. I been a loyal customer for years and they are treating wrong here and from my knowledge unlawfully. This is FRAUD and I did not give anyone permission to use my card. It was stolen from me and it was reported as such
2082,"On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo closed my credit card account which I had since the year XXXX. 

The account was current and in perfect standing. 

The only reason they are giving me for closing the account is because of payments that bounced from one of my external accounts "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ''. 

I actually called the bank XX/XX/XXXX to explain that I had mistakenly added an extra XXXX. They said not to worry and lifted the account suspension. To play it safe I went and did a cash payment to the branch. 

The bank RETRIED the withdrawal without me knowing and it bounced again, and they closed my account."
2083,"Minimum payment increased unexpectedly and extremely high, with no notice, I've never had a late payment and have a good credit history. Minimum payment increased to XXXX, and the interest rate is XXXX monthly."
2084,Fraudulent. Transactions on  my. Wells Fargo.   XXXX   ( as per uploaded picture ). Police are treating it as a stolen card. But Wells Fargo think I  used it even though The Person in question is on  XXXX . Fraudulently using my card in the  XXXX .  XXXX .
2085,"I have a Wells Fargo credit card that I paid off. Before I did, I had zero issue paying the balance or paying on time. I XXXX out their card in the process of buying a house. 

A subscription service that I tried canceling 7 times, that kept charging the card without my knowledge. The second I realized, I paid the amount ( around {$10.00} ), but it was already past due. I tried explaining that this was unauthorized use of the card. I also explained that due to the nature of us closing on a house within 30 days, this is an urgent matter, since it was reported as a late payment. They will not remove the mark regardless of the fact that it was unauthorized, and at one point, a rep told me once you use the card once with the merchant, you gave the permission permanently. This is a load of XXXX, and I know that. 

Ive been trying to get them to remove the late payment for two days ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ), and everyone is kicking me around. They know that this is about to lose me my house, but everyone tells me whoops get over to that department. I dont care about paying the amount, but the part that bothers me is that I am disputing the validity of the charges, I have been a good and upstanding customer for years, Ive never had an issue in the past, and they refuse to just tell me how I can contact the right people. They literally told me that they dont know how to contact their credit bureau, who it is, contact info for the credit bureau, or a timeline or if they are trying to remove it. To make it all better, they just kick me around and refuse to give me contact information while I BEG them to just give me a way to contact the right person. 

I also had a rewards balance that MORE than covered the balance on the card, but they didnt use it and they didnt allow me to apply it to the erroneous balance on the card. Seems like if you have money of mine already, you should probably just use it. 

At the end of the day, the charges were fraudulent, and I paid them regardless. Im not asking for money back. Im not asking for them to do anything except undo the damage. I just want to be treated like a human being and have compassion to the gravity of the case. Im buying a house and I cant wait for them to kick me around to 30 more departments over the next 3 months, when its not money I even tried to spend. To make it all better, my wife is XXXX and we are terrified our loan is in jeopardy. Were about to be homeless and Wells Fargo is just saying sit on your hands."
2087,"I paid my Wells Fargo Micro Center credit card in full in XXXX, but they charged me interest of which I was unaware until I tried to use the card in XXXX. I asked them to rescind the charges, but they refused to do so. It was a paltry amount of money, {$27.00}, which I paid to appease them. My Credit Score has been negatively affected due to this, as I see it, fake interest charge and negative reporting on my credit. I spoke with a man named XXXX with Wells Fargo to dispute their negative reporting, he took my complaint and submitted it, however, he is unaware of the CFPB or what its real function is. He said that it will take ten days or more to get an answer by mail regarding my complaint."
2088,"On XX/XX/2018 I logged on to my Wells Fargo account portal to schedule the monthly payment. I followed the same steps as always, scheduling a full balance payment to be transferred from my saved checking account. Wells Fargo acknowledges that I logged on that day but did not record my payment. They suggested that I may not have hit submit to finalize the payment. I am 100 % positive that I scheduled the payment in the same way I have for many years now. After a couple calls about this matter, Wells Fargo agreed to waive the late fee of {$25.00}, however the charged interest remains and presumably a negative remark on my credit report for a late payment. Perhaps they are correct and the error was on my part. Or perhaps the matter is not so uncommon and other customers have had similar situations? My confidence in Wells Fargo has been shaken by past behavior and my experience with this matter. I report this matter in case this has happened to others and document the prevalence."
2089,"On XX/XX/XXXX I initiated an electronic payment which my bank indicated would arrive to my lending institution on XX/XX/XXXX. This was the date I intended the payment to arrive. My statement cut off date was XX/XX/XXXX. I wanted this payment to be applied to the XX/XX/XXXX statement. 

When I received my statement dated XX/XX/XXXX it did not reflect my payment of {$320.00} which was scheduled to arrive on XX/XX/XXXX. So I did not believe anything was amiss. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Wells Fargo which stated : "" We wanted to remind you that your payment for your WELLS FARGO XXXX XXXX ending in XXXX  is due today : XX/XX/XXXX. As of XXXX XXXX  PST, the minimum payment due has not been scheduled or received. '' I immediately called them and told them over the phone that I had sent a payment of {$320.00} and that my bank showed they had received the payment. They told me that my payment of {$320.00} was actually received on XX/XX/XXXX and had been applied to the XX/XX/XXXX statement, thereby creating a double payment for that statement and no payment for the XX/XX/XXXX statement. 

I told them that was incorrect and requested they needed to fix it. 

I was assured on the phone that they would fix this and that I would not be charged a late fee and also that my 0 % interest status would not be forfeited by this "" late payment. '' Today I received my XX/XX/XXXX credit card statement in the mail and it showed my account past due. It showed my timely payment for {$320.00} dated XX/XX/XXXX. I was charged a late payment fee of {$29.00}. 

When I print "" recent activity '' on their website it shows the last payment was received on XX/XX/XXXX. It does not show the payment I made yesterday on XX/XX/XXXX. The XX/XX/XXXX statement does not reflect the payment, but the XX/XX/XXXX statement does reflect the payment."
2090,"Wells Fargo abruptly closed my credit card without any warning and forfeited all rewards accumulated over several months. I was given no opportunity to redeem the rewards after the bank decided to close my accounts. 

I missed to make minimum payment by due to date on the account not due to financial difficulties but due to an ongoing medical issue with a family member that has kept me exceptionally busy for the month and half. Upon learning of the missed payment, I immediately made full payment on all outstanding amount. Prior to this I never had a missed payment with either Wells Fargo or any bank. My XXXX XXXX has been consistently over XXXX."
2092,"Date reported - XX/XX/2017 - amount {$0.00} - account status, PAID - payment status, collection/chargeoff. Credit Card went over limit and was paid off and account was closed."
2095,"I paid {$700.00} on my Wells Fargo credit card for a XXXX XXXX XXXX furniture purchase. 
I was told by the credit bureau that only {$400.00} was applied to the principal. When I contact the company, they tell me all {$700.00} was applied to the principal, but the balance due, statement, and credit bureaus tell a different story. This was not applied correctly, and they are not even acknowledging an error occurred. This seems very deceptive and illegal."
2099,In XXXX of 2014 I went to Wells Fargo to apply for an auto loan to which I recieved but only because I also was told I needed to open a credit card account with them in order to be approved for an auto loan. Being a young man wanting my car I thought it was legit being that this information was coming from my bank. Fast forward 4 years and this is not the cause. Causing me multiple headaches in fees and interest over a credit card I never needed to open in the first place. Wells Fargo has ruined my future.
2100,"This complaint involves a line of credit that I have with Wells Fargo. The account is 5 years old. I don't remember opening the account or never used the account. I never needed the account. Every year the account did not appear on my online account except when it was time to pay the {$25.00} fee for the account. I always made the payment online. I would say that I wanted to close the account but never able to do so. I was told that if I closed the account I would not be able to reopen the account. In XX/XX/XXXXI told the person on the phone again that I want to close the account and that I never needed the account or wanted it. A few day later I saw on my online account that my credit card was closed. My credit card was separate or should have been. I surmised that the two account may have been linked. I went to Wells Fargo located in XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX. They could not see what had happened but managed to reopen my credit card which had a balance on it. The could not give me any information on the line of credit or close it. I didn't have an account number, credit card or check and no way to access this account. I received a letter stating that the matter had been sent to mediation. 
Later I received a welcome package. The case had already gone to mediation. I did try to contact the person who had sent the package and was told they didn't know how to reach her. 
No agreement was met in Mediation. 

Thank you, XXXX XXXX XXXX"
2101,"Wells Fargo XXXX credit card account was opened in my name on XX/XX/22 and used the same day without my knowledge. I have learned when I receive the welcoming package for this fraudulent credit card on XX/XX/22 and went in person, on the same day, to the Wells Fargo Bank at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX to show letter and cancel this XXXX account immediately. The manager contacted Wells Fargo Fraud Dept that close the account in the system. On XX/XX/22 i received the XXXX credit card bill of {$710.00} ; account I did not open and trusted it was cancelled as fraudulent one month ago, and at the same day, I contacted XXXX credit card to confirm this is a fraudulent account and it was supposed to be cancelled in the system. I was transferred to the Fraud Dept at Wells Fargo, which open the cancellation # XXXX and did nothing else ( I thought this was done on XX/XX/22 when I went in person to the Wells Fargo Bank ). On XX/XX/22 I received again the XXXX credit card bill to be paid by XX/XX/22. On XX/XX/22, I called XXXX Wells Fargo credit card again and was transferred this time to the Wells Fargo Executive office that issue case # XXXX. They guaranteed I will not get more bills. On XX/XX/22 I received a letter from Wells Fargo Collection stating that "" my credit card account remains past due '' - it is attached for your reference. On XX/XX/22 I called the number on the letter that is the Wells Fargo Collection Dept that knew nothing about Fraudulent account and transferred me to the Wells Fargo Claims Dept, which asked my information that Wells Fargo possibly does not have other than my name, address without apt number. I refused to give that person on the phone my social or date of birth. She got rude and it was so upsetting to me that I needed to hang up. Wells Fargo Bank N/A has all the recordings of my calls and it should be taken care of it and nothing has been done. The Wells Fargo bank has been dragging this {$710.00} bill ( actually currently {$740.00} ) for 3 months! This is really not acceptable and this bank needs to respect our time and do the correct action. This bank should close as customer service is not in its priority list."
2102,"Can a bank ask me to send them a copy of my social security to verify my identity in the application process for a credit card? 
After applying for a Wells Fargo Bank credit card, I received a letter in the mail asking me to send them a copy of my Social Security to verify my identity or my application would be denied. Due to the sensitivity of this information I see myself in the need to ask if this is legal because in many opportunities the community has been warned not to deliver this information to any agency and I have many credit cards and this has never happened or is it such I am facing a XXXX activity due my name."
2105,"I contacted Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX regarding what I feel is a deceptive and unfair practice in how payments are applied to my account balance. This card is for use only with medical/dental expenses provided by approved providers. Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX offers an interest-free/deferred period on each individual charge. If the charge is not paid off within the designated number of months, the full amount of interest ( from the date of the charge ) is added to the balance and accumulated forward. In my case, the rate is 12.99 %. I currently have XXXX separate charges on my account. Payment has been made on a timely basis since the inception of the account. I have paid more than the minimum payment nearly every month in order to pay off the balances of each charge prior to the end of the interest-deferred period. 

In XXXX I paid double the minimum amount for a total of {$300.00}, ( an additional {$150.00} over the minimum payment required ), believing that one of the older charges would be paid off in its entirety and the second oldest charge would be reduced accordingly. I was dismayed to discover when the new statement arrived, that only a fraction of my payment had been applied to the oldest charge. Much of the payment had been apportioned to the newer charges that have more distant interest-deferred periods. 

I talked with the representative and was told that payments are apportioned to all the charges at the rate of 3.5 % of the charge. I feel this is an unfair practice because it makes it more difficult to pay off the balances that will in the nearer term incur the full amount of interest that has accumulated back to the original charge date. 

This is a deceptive practice, leading consumers to believe that if they make sufficient payments to pay off each charge during the interest-deferred period, they will not incur any interest on each charge. 

I understand banks are in business to make money, and interest is a major way of doing so. However, if the bank does not wish to provide interest-deferred accounts, they should not do so, especially under these deceptive circumstances. 

I ask that this practice be reviewed and require the bank to apply payments to the oldest charges first, in the order they were made. This will help consumers be able to pay off charges without incurring large interest charges in the spirit of which they opened the account in the first place."
2106,"I'm having a problem with Wells Fargo. My XXXX XXXX account. Specifically, payment allocations for purchases, balance transfers, cash advances, overdraft advances, and bill pay advances. They are not applying my payments to most expensive balances. They are only applying the amount over the minimum to the 5 interest balances. WF claims that this is federal laws for banking."
2114,This bank treats me horrible I recently lost my wallet and reported my 2 credit cards as lost stolen and their was fraud charges I was billed they said I wont be liable until recently they mail me letters and are extremely rude threat to close my accounts this is not fair very rude and they wont initiate a claim to refund me the charges they promised me would they denied my claim claiming I had the card In my posesion when this was reported immediately to them

Fast forward in XXXX I made a follow-up call to Wells Fargos Credit Card Claims Department and it turns out they have denied my fraud claim because I have filed "" too many '' disputes. This is absolutely ridiculous and I have since made an appeal along with filing a police report. Wells Fargos did make any effort to protect me as the consumer in this case.

I have two credit cards with Wells Fargo and the offer was shown for both cards on the rewards website. I received the bonus rewards for the first qualifying purchases on each card but not the second purchases. I have contacted Wells Fargo multiple times, and also submitted a complaint through the better business bureau, the response I received led me to think that the complaint wasn't actually read because the transaction that I was referencing were not the transaction that they mentioned. I made a purchase at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX MO on XX/XX/2021 for {$130.00} using my Propel card which should have earned 1320 bonus points.

They do have a hire interest rate on a secured card and charge me XXXX dollars annual fee, i beleive that is why they hold people captive in this sceem and should be fully investigated, it is now going on three years and always same buul story when you call them, they say you where late, over limit.

2140,"Initiated a balance transfer from another account to Wells Fargo and made timely payments during the promotional period. 15 days before the expiration of the promotional period I called in to pay 100 % of the balance off before the promotional period expires and interest is charged. Three levels of customer service confirmed with me that I could not pay off a specific promotional balance because their system did not allow for payments to be applied to specific promotional balances ( I had two ). Further, I was repeatedly told that though my statements say the promotional interest rate expires on XX/XX/2020, it didn't really expire until the end of the billing cycle, or XX/XX/2020. I was told this is actually how Wells Fargo does this, but yet, I had nothing in writing to back up their statements. I was told to call in after the close of the billing cycle and as assured on the phone I would not be charged interest until after the close of the billing cycle. Three issues : 1. Zero ability to pay off the promotional balance separately, and, 2. I had zero documentation reported to me on how my payments would be applied, because my thought is they would be applied to the balance expiring first, and, 3. I had zero documentation reported to me on their purported actual date the promotional  interest rate actually expires. 

I want to pay what I owe and have it paid before I am charged interest, yet, this does not seem possible."

We we reached out to Wells Fargo Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX then stated that she closed the account within 30 days and refused to reset the account. Our banker XXXX XXXX got involved a verified for XXXX XXXX XXXX that this was indeed a bank error and instructed Ms. XXXX to put the account back the way it was. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX set an auto payment for {$3900.00} that was unauthorized and this payment was done through our business/personal online account. We were unaware that XXXX XXXX XXXX had accessed our account online and set a payment in place and then the billing cycle of XX/XX/XXXX passed and there was not a pymt processed and then on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX forced a payment through our Wells Fargo Account and bounced a {$8400.00} check for our business building lease to XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX on purpose. When we were notified by our landlords that our first check had bounced - we contacted Wells Fargo Bank and the agent could not see who set the payment and it said YOU in the signing credentials. This was all internally done by Wells Fargo Employees and it is Wire Fraud and Theft. XXXX XXXX XXXX continued to access my account in XXXX and set another payment for {$1000.00} in place - she also refused to put the rewards back on the account as she was instructed to do so and open the credit card back up again. XXXX XXXX XXXX has continued to log into our online account and we have filed several complaints online, with the Wells Fargo Executive Office and also inside the branch. I was notified that XXXX XXXX XXXX is still working with Wells Fargo Bank and I believe that Ms. XXXX is the reason we are continously have phone numbers that are allowed to be texted to get into the online account instead of the XXXX I purchased last year from Wells Fargo Bank for security. We also informed her supervisor XXXX XXXX and Mr. XXXX in Arizona. 

We have awaited a review and only to find out now that we have to start all over again and after Wells Fargo Executive Office has been reviewing these events for the past year now we have been advised to start over again with the Fraud department. I am frightened and also received a phone call from XXXX XXXX XXXX threatening me when we reported this during the initial investigation. We reported this to Wells Fargo Bank several times and they have ignored our complaints. 

My credit has been ran several times with Wells Fargo without my authorization and we believe that there is fraud on this account and we did not set up our accounts to monitor our credit.

2148,"On XX/XX/XXXX I placed an order for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Model XXXX at a price of {$350.00} and paid for it with XXXX points from my Wells Fargo GoFarRewards account # XXXX. The product was shipped to me from XXXX XXXX and arrived on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from "" XXXX '' which referenced Wells Fargo/XXXX and offered seven XXXX XXXX products for sale, one of which was the identical model I had purchased from Wells Fargo. However, the XXXX price was {$130.00}, less than half the price I had paid. 

I could not understand how such a large discrepancy in price could exist for one product among reputable sellers, unless an error had been made. So I went online to check how other retailers were pricing this product. The XXXX XXXX offered it at {$180.00} ; XXXX, at {$140.00} ; XXXX XXXX, {$180.00} and XXXX XXXX, {$180.00}. Average price of the five outlets works out to {$170.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I went to the Wells Fargo website and sent a message concerning the price discrepancy and the unreasonable difference between Wells Fargo 's price and the price of other stores which sell the same product. In view of these facts I asked that Wells Fargo restore equity to my transaction by refunding XXXX points to my GoFarRewards account. I received a confirmation from Wells Fargo that my message had been received and I could expect to hear from them within 10 days. I waited one month for a response, and on XX/XX/XXXX I sent a second message on the Wells Fargo website. I asked that if they are not willing to make an adjustment for the price discrepancy that they authorize me to return the product and cancel the transaction altogether. 

I received a letter by mail dated XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX, Research and Remediation Manager, Executive Office, Wells Fargo Bank. Mr. XXXX stated that his research team expected to provide me with a response on or before XX/XX/XXXX. A second letter dated XX/XX/XXXX came to me from XXXX XXXX, Research and Remediation Analyst in which she said she was working on my case and I could expect a response by XX/XX/XXXX. A third letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX arrived from XXXX XXXX stating her research is continuing and I can expect a response by XX/XX/XXXX. A fourth letter dated XX/XX/XXXX arrived from XXXX XXXX in which she stated she is unable to honor my request because rewards are not refundable once redeemed.

I was instructed I must go to a local branch and submit a photo ID in order to request my personal information be purged from their records. Ironically, I have never gone into "" a local branch '' to open up any accounts or to obtain credit cards from them ; therefore, why should I go into one now just to request all of my information be purged from their system? 

I have been a past victim of identity theft, as well as being one-of-the-thousands of Wells Fargo customers whose excellent credit information was utilized to enhance their business reputation. I do not appreciate nor want Wells Fargo to be in possession of any of my personal information for fear of what happened previously and has the potential of happening again.

I tried to fix that problem with the bank, but when I called they told me that I am not paying the full balance, and that is why money is accumulating in my outstanding balance. Which is a lie, because I am 100 % sure that with each payment I make, I pay 100 % of my outstanding balance. They refused to try to continue helping me, and I even asked them if they could start a further investigation, and they refused. I need your help, because my money is being taken from me in a blatant way. If you need my personal information, and my bank account information, I can gladly provide you. But please, I need this case cleared up as soon as possible. My suspicions are that the Wells Fargo Mobile App does not record some payments I make, and what it does is accumulate and accumulate payments that have already been paid each month. In fact, when speaking with the Wells Fargo customer service assistant, I gave him that idea, so that they would study my problem further, but they refused, and they kept firm that "" I don't pay my balance completely '', but it is not like that, I am 100 % that I pay every month "" Everything, without leaving late payments '' Thank you very much for your help, I fully trust you.

I called Wells Fargo customer service at XXXX on 3 times already ( twice on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ). 
I was asked to wait until statement generated and it has been generated over 2 weeks and still customer service is unable to help and resolve my queries. Most of the customer service do not understand WELLS FARGO REWARDS program so they kept transferring me to different group and once they connect me to right person, they hung up the phone in the middle of conversation or while they are researching the issue.

2179,Wells Fargo is dragging their feet in processing my dispute with XXXX XXXX. I have spoken with my dispute specialist XXXX XXXX XXXX-3 times in a four month plus period about this particular dispute. I have not heard from her since XX/XX/XXXX when she was going to reach out to the merchant. Even with Covid-19 this time frame is unacceptable and I have no way to directly contact Ms. XXXX.

When I called again on Thursday, XX/XX/2021 to cancel the account and file a fraud claim with Wells Fargo credit card company, I was again told that I could not close out my credit card account."
2183,"CFPB Complaint Against : Wells Fargo Product : Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa Card Issue : APR is higher than maximum % listed in the terms and conditions Wells Fargo Case # XXXX - Assigned to Executive Care Case Manager, XXXX - XXXX Attached : Spreadsheet showing : APR Range ( Margin ) and U.S. Prime Rate taken from the Terms & Conditions of this credit card from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX ; Photos of Important Terms of Your Credit Card Account ; Your Credit Score and the Price You Pay for Credit ; T & C for the credit card from : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. 

Monday XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  CST After carefully reviewing the terms & conditions for the Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa Card ( https : //www.wellsfargo.com/credit-cards/visa-wise-platinum/terms ), clearly showing, then ( XX/XX/XXXX ) through now ( XX/XX/XXXX ), an APR range of 15.99 % to 26.99 %, based on credit worthiness. I submitted an application for the card and was instantly approved for a {$6000.00} limit. 


Saturday XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX CST Received the physical card with Important Terms of Your Credit Card Account, showing my APR after the introduction 0.00 % APR would be 27.49 %, 0.50 % higher than the maximum of the APR range, based on credit worthiness. 
Wells Fargo also provided their notice of Your Credit Score and the Price You Pay for Credit showing my credit score as of XX/XX/XXXX to be XXXX. 


Saturday XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX XXXX CST - XXXX XXXX Called the generic Wells Fargo customer service line ( XXXX ) and a rep confirmed he read the terms and conditions and stated my APR after the intro 0 % period was higher than the maximum % shown on the T & C. 
He created Case XXXX and provided me with the phone number XXXX to the Executive Customer Care Team and stated my case manager would call me Monday XX/XX/XXXX and this should hopefully be resolved EOD Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX. 


Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX XXXX CST XXXX XXXX - Case XXXX No contact has been received by Wells Fargo via email or phone by EOD Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX, so I called the number provided and was informed my Case Manager was  XXXX and was transferred to her. 
After reviewing the facts and both of us reviewing the T & C together at the same time, she placed me on hold for 10 minutes. When she returned, she stated that there was nothing Wells Fargo could or would do and the interest rate would not be changing XXXX all their calls are recorded so you can verify this ). 
I explained having my APR higher than the maximum amount listed in the terms and conditions is a violation of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 ( 15 U.S.C. 1601 ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1637 ) and that I would be filing a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) complaint. She then stated she would forward this to an internal department she could not name for further review of the situation and would get back to me in a few days. 

At no point between XX/XX/XXXX ( and possibly earlier, can easily be researched ) and today XX/XX/XXXX, has the Margin for purchases and balance transfers ever exceeded 21.74 % ; regardless of what the U.S. Prime Rate is, yet mine is 22.24 %. 
This is a 0.50 % higher than the maximum Margin APR Range ( 10.74 % to 21.74 % ) provided in the Terms and Conditions ( https : //www.wellsfargo.com/creditcards/ visa-wise-platinum/terms ) for the Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa Card . 
This caused my APR after the introduction 12-month 0.00 % APR to be 27.49 %, which also is 0.50 % higher than the maximum APR Range listed in the T & C ( 15.99 % to 26.99 % ). 
I believe having a higher APR than the maximum % possible listed in the Terms & Conditions is a violation of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 ( 15 U.S.C. 1601 ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1637 ). 

Additionally, I would like to inquire as to why I was given ( over ) the maximum APR possible, based on credit worthiness. Based on the documents they sent me Your Credit Score and the Price You Pay for Credit my credit score as of XX/XX/XXXX is XXXX / XXXX. My credit history includes : 0 late payments ever, no derogatory marks ever, no collections ever, 100 % on-time payments for nearly 10 years since I turned XXXX, not a single negative mark against it. 
What credit score do I require to get an APR lower than the absolute maximum they offer? 
What % of applicants receive an APR lower than the absolute maximum they offer? 
What is the average credit score for all the consumers who received an APR lower than the absolute maximum they offer?"
2185,"This is my complaint about Wells Fargo ( WF ) Earn More Mall Reward Program. 

In XXXX, I receive 50 % cash back offers from WF,  stating that I could receive 50 % cash back if I use my credit card at XXXX XXXX ( cap at {$100.00} cash back ) and XXXX   ( cap at {$70.00} cash back ) in store. AFTER enrolled in the offers from WF online banking system ( screenshot that shows my enrollment is saved ), I met the requirement mentioned in both store on XX/XX/2018 and expected {$170.00} for my purchases from XXXX XXXX and XXXX 

However, I did not receive {$170.00} from WF after a month. Therefore, I tried to contact WF to create a case for investigation. After the case was escalated to the executive office, Mr. XXXX XXXX has reviewed my case ( case # XXXX ) and contacted me. It sounded to me that WF doesn't recognize my enrollment from the system, therefore, can't issue the cash back. I provided my screenshot twice to WF, but they still couldn't honor me the cash back. I should be receiving what I was offered, and clearly, this problem is caused by their system glitches.

I would not recommend people use WF Earn More Mall offers based on my experience."
2187,"In XX/XX/XXXX I responded to an advertisement from XXXX XXXX promoting a furniture sale and offering either a cash discount or interest free payments for 36 months with financing by Wells Fargo. I opted for the interest free payments. Since I had not used this type of financing before, I spent hours scrutinizing the initial billing statements to ensure I understood Wells Fargos calculations, and I confirmed that if I made 36 monthly payments in the amount of the minimum due ( {$120.00} ) as listed on Wells Fargos billing statements, the principal balance would be paid in full within the promotional period. To avoid the possibility of any problems, I then set up automatic monthly payments of {$130.00}. 

In XX/XX/XXXXbefore the original interest-free promotional period expiredI was again shopping at XXXX and then offered a similar choice between a cash discount or 12 months of interest free payments. I asked if I was eligible since was already participating in the first promotional, and if so, how it would work. I was told that, yes, I could take advantage of the new offer and that all I would need to do is to make the new minimum payments such that Wells Fargo received payments sufficient to pay off each balance within the applicable promotional period. I accepted. 

My next billing statement indicated that the minimum payment due on the account was now {$200.00}, which was the amount needed to pay for the second purchase within its 12-month promotional period. I adjusted my automatic monthly payments and made all payments at scheduled and consistent with the Wells Fargo billing statements and minimum monthly amount due. However, at the end of the promotional period Wells Fargo, without warning, applied a {$680.00} interest charge to the account! As soon as I became aware there was a dispute, to avoid any further issues, I immediately paid off the entire remaining principal balance for the original purchase even though its 36-month promotional period did not expire until XX/XX/XXXX, roughly 8 months later. 

After steadfastly disputing the interest charge, and an extensive review of the underlying payment history and documentation, it is apparent that Wells Fargo artificially manufactured its interest claim through false, misleading, and deceptive advertising and billing practices. Specifically, although Wells Fargo issued billing statements with a minimum payment that ensured payment of the 12-month financing within the promotional period, and although I had an additional 8 months within which to complete the payments on account of the 36-month financing, Wells Fargo did not apply the payment that I remitted consistently with its calculation of the minimum amounts due. Instead, it took the payments made on account of the 12-month financing and applied themwithout any disclosure whatsoeverto the 36-month financing. And theneven though it has received payment of the entire balance due under the 12-month financing within the promotional period, because of the way it secretly applied the payments internally, it cried gotcha and applied an interest charge. 

This is absolutely shameful and abusive. Moreover it is inconsistent with industry practices. Other companies, such as XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, to name a few, when multiple promotional period apply, disclose on their billing statements that outstanding balance due, the promotional expiration date, and the minimum payment due for each separate promotion. Wells Fargo does not. Wells Fargo simply provides one total minimum payment due for both promotions, and by conflating the two separate promotional lines and calculating the minimum payment in a way that is designed to mislead consumers into believing that their payments are being made on one account, and then secretly applying them to another account without disclosure, it is able to artificially manufacture artificial interest claims for itself. In all of our discussions about the account, Wells Fargo has not disputed this. 

In fact, Under Wells Fargos logic, by accepting XXXX  promotional offer with respect to the second purchase, I was waiving the benefits of the first promotional offer because the only way to pay off the second purchase within its promotional period would be to pay off the entire original purchase financed and waive the remaining 8 months of the original interest-free period! This was nowhere disclosed in the Wells Fargo/XXXX marketing and advertising materials, and is contrary to the representation that XXXX made to me when enticing me to accept the 12-month promotional rate and to make another furniture purchase. 

In an effort to resolve matters, although I dispute that any interest is due, in XX/XX/XXXX I offered a {$150.00} payment in satisfaction and accord of all disputed interest charges. Wells Fargo accepted the payment, which pursuant to Section 3-311 of the Uniform Commercial Code fully satisfied the original contract between us. 

However, despite its knowledge of the underlying dispute, and despite its acceptance of the payment in satisfaction and accord of our original contract, Well Fargo has repeatedly exacerbated the situation by improperly flagged my account as past due andwhen I submitted a dispute to the credit reporting agenciesthen knowingly and falsely claiming that the interest charge that it is seeking to collect is undisputed. These knowing and willful false statements are in blatant violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

While I am still hopeful that this can be resolved without litigation against Wells Fargo, I am not optimistic given their repeated, and escalating, improper actions. I am certainly moving all of my accounts away from Wells Fargo at the first opportunity ( ending a 34 year banking relationship with them ) and I will not be doing business with them again."

2192,"This is a complaint in regards to Wells Fargo '' Claims Assistance Center - Credit Card Fraud Claims ''. 

Me and my wife are now going through our 3rd claim in trying to get a refund from 2 cash advances that was taking out by identity theft. 

Someone stole my wife 's wallet on XX/XX/2019 in XXXX XXXX, CA. 
This person went to two Wells Fargo branches and took out two cash advances in the amount of {$2600.00} and {$3000.00}, a total of {$5600.00}. 


The person who took out the cash advances impersonated my wife using her I.D and falsified her signature. 

Wells Fargo is not being helpful in the process of refunding these unauthorized transactions. 
Wells Fargo believes that it was my wife who made these cash advances because the ''signature matches her ID ''. 

Wells Fargo has not showed us these falsified signatures or showed us the CCTV footage where these transactions took place which was INSIDE Wells Fargo Branches. 

We are very stressed about this situation, we feel that we have done everything right by our part. 

As soon as my wife noticed the transactions by logging in on her wells fargo account, she immediately called wells fargo to close the account. This was done on XX/XX/2019, same day as the fraud took place. 

On early morning on XX/XX/2019, we went to the police to file a police report. 
We have submitted this police report TWICE to Wells Fargo XXXX Claims Assistance Center - Credit Card Fraud Claims '', but to no avail. 

Wells Fargo still believes my wife did these transactions but they won't let us look at the falsified signatures or the CCTV footage which would confirm that my wife could not have done this. 

This is causing extreme stress, we are currently awaiting our first child and we need the credit card to prepare for our child. 
Wells Fargo has shown extreme negligence in handling our claim and we need this resolved ASAP."
2193,"I tried to use the advertised return benefit protection on my card for a purchase made on XX/XX/2020. Its an absolute pain to start a claim with WF because they're website and claim forms are all directing to different phone numbers with terrible customer support and missing key information eg. where to send documentation for a claim. 

I received an email after submitting the claim from XXXX XXXX  @ XXXX XXXX ( apparently two separate benefit providers for the same WF XXXX card protection ... thats 4 different companies involved for one benefit ) and was told to call a phone number for instructions. After over 2hrs and 10+ phone calls being bounced around by offshore customer service reps, I got disconnected for the last time and gave up. This is a terrible experience trying to send in the item that I opened the claim for. The last rep said "" my contract had expired '' ... what contract? I submitted a claim ... I dont have any contract. I was then sent over to a contract team where I was promptly hung up on."
2194,"I have a checking, credit card, and brokerage account with Wells Fargo. On XXXX we had an issue with our brokerage account since we were converting it from a cash account to margin. I used my Wells Fargo credit card to pull a cash advance in the amount of $ XXXX and moved it to our brokerage. After finding out I didn't need to do this ( since the margin call was erroneous ), I paid the cash advance back in full XX/XX/XXXX ( before my credit card statement ). I called and spoke to customer service and a supervisor to request leniency and understanding to have the {$350.00} cash advance fee reversed since I paid the amount immediately. They refunded {$20.00}. Then my statement cut and even though I already paid the entire balance before the statement, I was charged {$38.00}. I requested this be refunded on XX/XX/XXXX which was denied. Completely appalling for Wells Fargo to claim that their internal process does not allow fee reversals anymore."

The other was a PIN for the aforementioned card. I called the number for customer service from the first letter. I stated I had not had an account with Wells Fargo for at least 12 years and that I had not applied for a card with them. The first thing they asked for after my name was my FULL social security number. I said I would not give them this and would go to the local bank .I did so that same day and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX He looked up the card and stated an account had been opened in my name online with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX.

She said there was an investigation recently started into this kind of issue and, in fact, XXXX told me before the call there had just been an Alert issued that day or the day before. I asked XXXX to have this account closed that day. XXXX, who would not give her last name, said that she would not close the account because she did not know if that was OK due to the investigation. She gave XXXX a claim # XXXX for their investigation. When XXXX got off the phone I insisted that account be closed .He did so and I was given a document stating that the account was closed.

2212,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the full remaining amount of my business 's XX/XX/XXXX credit card statement balance. The due date for this statement was XX/XX/XXXX. This payment was made via ACH, and that business checking account has been set up on the Wells Fargo website and used for these payments for well over a year. ( We have also never had a payment get returned for NSF. ) The payment cleared our business checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX, our available credit balance has not been updated to reflect the XX/XX/XXXX payment. From communications with my Wells Fargo business relationship banker, no one internally at Wells Fargo could explain why a hold was put in place on our credit - and no communication has been received on my end. This situation is extremely frustrating and damaging, especially regarding the lack of transparency and follow through on promised follow ups.

2217,"Around XX/XX/2020, I contacted Wells Fargo about trouble paying as the result of financial difficulties from COVID 19. They said they would wave my late fee 's and interest on the credit card, as well as work with me through the pandemic. They also said they would defer my payments. However, a couple of days latter, Wells Fargo reported me to the credit bureau for late payments and closed my credit card account. I called again on XX/XX/2020 and they said that deferment was suppose to happen, but no one took action on it. The person I spoke with said they are going to talk to their manager and work out the issue."
2219,"This all started with a rogue, {$30.00} charge on my account with wells fargo. I contacted the company who made the charge and told them I had closed my account. I had done this, but they told me there was another account with an expired credit card from 2 years ago. They recently used the visa account updater service to retrieve a new payment token from Visa and Wells Fargo. I have closed my account with the merchant and opted out of their renewal program. I contacted wells fargo to find out how to opt out of the visa updater service and no one there that I spoke with knows anything about this. The visa updater service is a 2 part process. Wellsfargo has to get my information, or a token, to visa who relays it to the requesting merchant. Wells fargo is telling me I can opt out with the merchant. The merchant is telling me I can ask to opt out of this from the bank. The bank is tellingme I can not opt out of it from them and that I have to try to do this with the merchant. Meanwhile if you XXXX search "" vau opt out '' there are many discussions from small banks who are tyring to find out the best way to offer an opt out to their customers, and whether or not they have to notify them when a request comes in. This indicates that it is the bank ( the company that provided the debit/credit card a customer would contact to opt out of the VAU ( visa account updater service ). I want to be able to opt out of this as I see it as an invasion of my privacy when a bank would send payment information to a merchant on their request, not on mine. If I choose to not update a card at a merchant, I want it to be on me, not up to the bank."
2221,"In XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo posted on my XXXX XXXX billing statement that my 6 month 0 % apr promo period was ending. My account was created in XX/XX/XXXX with a 1 year promotional billing period. When I submitted a complaint to Wells Fargo, they acknowledged an error and said that my promo period should have in fact been valid until XX/XX/XXXX. According to the policy on the back of the bill, if you submit an error to Wells Fargo, and they determine they were wrong, you will not pay any interest or fees on the amount questioned. Regardless of this policy, in XX/XX/XXXX I was charged an astronomical interest fee, at which point my {$200.00} balance reflected a {$140.00} interest fee. When I contacted customer service, he indicated that this is the interest on my amount owed in XX/XX/XXXX when my promotional term expired. I informed him that my promo term expired in XX/XX/XXXX, not XX/XX/XXXX, and that was an error I had previously disputed with Wells Fargo, so I should not have interest at all. He continued to assure me that the amount in question was correct, even though the amount which reflected an interest payment ( XXXX ) was never indicated as an amount owed at any time in my billing history. There was no further explanation on the bill. The rep then proceeded to calculate various numbers to find where a {$140.00} interest charge would come from, but he could n't pinpoint an amount that would yield this interest charge. He stood by the fact that the bill was correct, despite the fact the amounts were so deceptive that he could not even explain it. He then pushed the Average Daily Balance as the reason for my interest charge, claiming I was charged interest on my average daily balance for the previous month, but instead of explaining this to me, he continued to say it was too complicated for consumers to understand how they calculate how much they owe. I requested this complicated algorithm, because as a consumer you have a right to know what you are paying. Evidently, these things are so deceptive, it is a secret. According to the billing error policy, I should not have interest at all, yet Wells Fargo is attempting to deceive me into an extra profit for their company. I have written a letter to complain about my interest charge, since it should be {$0.00}, but have not yet received a reply."
2222,Every month welfargo charges {$65.00} intrest on outstanding purchases I made through a store credit they issued to me while I am still making payments to pay off the balance.

This was also reported to my credit.
2227,"My issue involves WellsFargo Credit company due to them labeling me as deceased with no explanation. I want to say this error happened on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted a Wellsfargo branch in person to submit a proof of life document, and called social security, in which I was told they had no indication of me being deceased and that they did not contact the bank. Basically, I have been given different dates on when my previous credit card will return to my account. 4 different occasions, I called the credit company and they would tell me wait until a certain day. That day would come or pass and I would be told a different date. Finally, I was transferred to their higher up on XX/XX/XXXX to be told they don't know why I was labeled as deceased and I would have to wait two more business days. I've been with this bank since I was a teenager for almost 14 years and I feel like they are being laxed and not completely honest with processing my documents to return credit card. I was in good standing with my credit card, and I'm even unable to get a new one because of their error. To know that Wellsfargo credit company does not have specific notes to why I was listed as deceased is disturbing and makes me feel that the process can happen again without them taking precautionary steps to ensure they have accurate information. This is another stress I have added to my life and I've tried getting help from them, to which they seem to be clueless."

2233,"I made 2 payments to my Wells Fargo credit card bill from 2 different banks for XX/XX/22, the payment for XXXX was received and credited to the account but the XXXX was not. I placed multiple calls to get this corrected. I finally spoke with a banker named XXXX ( female ) who took all my information to include the bank 's routing number, account number and the transaction number. She told me i did not need a case number and that this information would be noted on my account. I called Well Fargo today XX/XX/22, spoke with XXXX and he tells me none of the information I gave to XXXX 14 days ago was noted on my account. I was unable to provide him all the original information as I was a work. I told him I would have to call back to the main number and repeat my story for the XXXX time to a different banker. I called Wells Fargo back 1 hour later refusing to speak with a regular banker instead i demanded to speak with a supervisor called an escalation banker. I again repeat the information i gave to XXXX of XXXX, putting my trust that they wont use the information to steal money out of my bank account."
2234,"I transfered {$7000.00} from a business account into my credit card, which did not have a balance, by accident. After realizing the money had been transferred into the wrong account I immediately notice the money was out of my account and not in the originally intended account I found the money and began trying to reverse the transaction via online. After no success I began to call Wells Fargo Credit Card customer service I began to call to reverse the transaction. After being transferred three times I was told I had to wait up to 5 business days to receive my money back in my account. This all took place on XX/XX/2018 from the hours of XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. The final customer care person was XXXX XXXX with Wells Fargo Credit Card services. I would like to mention that all accounts involved were Wells Fargo Accounts."
2236,"On Friday XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to Wells Fargo to upgrade my credit card to their Cash Wise with the same line of credit that I have had since I was a XXXX in college, 6 years ago. I clearly stated that I wanted it to be an upgrade of the current line of credit as the line I had with Wells Fargo was my oldest line of credit. The person I spoke to ensured that I would be under the same line of credit since everything was done in house. The employee stated I qualified for an upgrade, and I went through an application process. They said they would close my account and open up a new one, but they at no time said this also meant I would have my credit line closed and receive a hard inquiry on my credit score. This significantly impacted my credit score with XXXX and XXXX. I feel Wells Fargo either deceived me or gave me false information pertaining to my credit card upgrade as I would not have approved of the upgrade if I new it would lead to the closure of my oldest line of credit. Wells Fargo is already notorious for illegal practices, and I should have known they would willing deceive me for their own benefit."
2237,"Wells Fargo sent me personalized marketing offering a 12 month 0 % interest promotional period for opening a XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card. As an existing Wells Fargo credit card customer, they have the right to use my customer information to market to me. 

I applied for the card at the end of XXXX and finally received my card on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to Wells Fargo representatives about the account on XX/XX/XXXX, and then several times after that when I was surprised to see that I had a minimum payment due. Previous experiences with Wells Fargo and XXXX credit cards did not have minimum payments due during promotional periods. They told me this one did. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I saw an interest charge when reviewing my online statement. I contacted the company to correct the error, as I was within the 12 month promotional period. I was told that because I had opened a Wells Fargo XXXX Visa in XX/XX/XXXX, I was ineligible for a promotional rate. 

Wells Fargo had ample opportunity to notify me of this during any of several previous calls about this account. Further, Wells Fargo should not have marketed to me offering a 0 % promotional rate if I was ineligible. Further still, I believe that opening a card on XX/XX/XXXX is more than 12 months away from the second open date of XX/XX/XXXX. 

This was deceptive and deprived me of the ability to manage my finances. I can not close this card without repercussions to my credit. I can not open another card with a different provider without repercussions to my credit. I have been choosing to save heavily rather than pay off balances, because I thought I had a 0 % line of credit, which caused me to incur interest charges I could have avoided. 

This is deceptive and a "" bait and switch '' advertising tactic. Wells Fargo made no reasonable effort to notify me of this ridiculous rule ( which I did not experience with XXXX or other providers ) and hid it in the "" fine print ''."
2241,"On XX/XX/2022 I was charged fraudulently by a XXXX XXXX to XXXX  XXXX XXXX for {$2000.00}. I have never used XXXX XXXX before and did not know it existed until someone tried charging my account with it on my Wells Fargo checking account. I only had {$360.00} in the account and the rest got charged to my credit card with overdraft protection. Thankfully my account had a credit limit of {$3000.00} because when I called the fraud department on the XXXX when I realized what had happened they had told me they tried to charge two additional XXXX XXXX money transfers to Bank XXXX XXXX of {$990.00}. 

I have called Wells Fargo 's fraud department twice since then. The first time I called the claims department person told me my computer or phone was compromised and to wipe everything off of both it which I did. Apparently for no reason now. a week from that they told me that I don't have enough evidence to prove the fraud claim. I have no idea how my account could have been compromised outside of a phishing email I had problems with that previous month in the middle of XXXX ( I don't remember the exact date, but I got a new credit card the moment I exited the phishing scam and realized what had just happened ). 

I did everything they told me to do regarding my account when the phishing scheme happened ( which only compromised my XXXX account which had the same email I use for my bank. They didn't think it necessary to change my email ) and thought it was taken care of, but it clearly was not. I have since changed every possible piece of personal info on my account that can be changed ( username, password, email, etc. ) and have added text notifications to my phone for anytime any charge on my account happens so I can be swifter about problems in the future, and I have added 2-step verification to my account as well to ensure no one outside of myself can use my account. 

I'm hopeful that by doing this I will have this nightmare taken care of for me, but just in case it doesn't I have also filed a police report on the matter."
2244,"Account Numbers XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo Closed both of my Secured Business Credit Cards. Which I have a collective deposit of {$50000.00} held by Wells Fargo. I also don't know why they closed both accounts and they will not tell me why they closed both accounts apparently my checking account is going to close n the XXXX of XXXX. 

I was never late and I never went over my limit infact I spent over {$100000.00} some months and never carried a balance. So the account was not closed due to performance. 

I have received several pieces of mail from Wells Fargo. In the form of letters telling me my account is closed. I got a statement saying my account is closed and a response to a letter that I wrote. 

However, I have not received a check for my {$50000.00} nor any guidance on when that is going to happen. There was no balance on the account when they closed them in fact I overpaid and should be getting {$50000.00} back to be factual. 

I have called and no one can tell me when I am getting my {$50000.00} back. 

So I am in limbo I want my {$50000.00} back because we are going on two weeks and I feel once again when I check my mail today there will be no check for {$50000.00}. They don't seem to be in urgency in getting my money back to me. 

At the moment I don't care why they closed my accounts. I do care about getting my {$50000.00} back as soon as possible. So anything that the CFPB can do to hurry this process along I will be very grateful. 

{$50000.00} is a lot of money to have just floating about with no indication of when I am getting my money.

2245,"Today on XX/XX/2019, I tried to resolve an evolving issue regarding my privacy information with regard to my credit card that I had with Wells Fargo. There has been a business senior Vice President named XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX who has invaded my personal information to collaborate with other businesses and other business people in the community to make money and ruin my reputation. They would use every little purchase to combine forces to help themselves and hurt my reputation. All of my purchases and dates. They even combined forces with local baseball players including the XXXX XXXX players named XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX."
2246,"I have had two Fraudulent charges on my account with Wells Fargo in the last 6 months. One of them was made before I had even activated the replacement card from the first fraudulent charge. The credit card itself was not in my possession. One fraud charge is understandable, mistakes happen but two so close together especially with a glaring red flag like the card not being activated is inexcusable."
2247,"I applied for WellsFargo Propel credit card on XX/XX/XXXX. I got an incomplete decision on the credit card. On the same day I called WellsFargo Credits Service Customer Care they mentioned I will receive a letter in the mail. A few days latter, I receive a letter asking me to call Customer Care and verify my identity. So, I call Customer Care again on XX/XX/XXXX, they verify my SSN and tell me that I should get a decision in 24 hours. I call again the next day XX/XX/XXXX, the rep tells me they need an additional form filled which I will receive in the Mail. I fill the form and send it around XX/XX/XXXX ( Unsure on the exact date ). I get no response from WellsFargo for the next month. I call Customer Care again on XX/XX/XXXX to ask about the application, the rep tells me that they had not review my application and will review in 24 hours. I call again on XX/XX/XXXX, they tell me that the application date has elapsed and they can not do anything, I ask them to remove the hard credit check since it was their mistake they did not review my application. Their response is that they would remove the check if I applied for the Card again but can not do anything otherwise. I ask them to still check, they said we will in 24 hours - I got no call. So on XX/XX/XXXX I called customer service again, they reiterated that if I reapply my older credit check would be removed. So I reapplied on XX/XX/XXXX, called customer service again after applying - they tell me my decision will be in 24 hours. I ask them to remove the previous check - they tell me it will be removed. I call again on XX/XX/XXXX - they tell me my credit card reapplication has been rejected - I ask for my credit check to be removed which they still haven't done. I ask the rep to transfer me to the complaints department - the rep says there is a system error which is not allowing it. The rep said they will call me in 1-2 days, I do not expect they will call. 
I have called WellsFargo a total of 8 times for this issue. None of my concerns have been resolved. Each call lasted at least 15 mins before I could even start discussing the issue."
2253,"Wells Fargo Bank closed  XXXX  of my accounts without notice and then would not let me pay them off for over  TWO YE ARS! They continued to show me Charged OFF and hurt my credit score for THREE Y EARS NOW! Accounts ending #  XXXX  for {$260.00} and #  XXXX  for  XXXX .     I had to hire an attorney to get  Wells Fargo to accept payment and they would not accept payment! I tried going into the bank and asked the managers to accept cash and they would not. I sen t two checks in a  letter I sent to Wells Fargo Headquarters in   XXXX   XXXX , certified mail return receipt ( attached ), attention the VP of Consumer Credit and they did not cash my checks and did not even respond to my certified letter! I have written letters and rec 'd   one form letter back which was a joke since they would n't accept payment.
I read an article about how Wells Fargo created all those FRAUD loan accounts and saw a special line to call if I had problems with Wells Fargo and called. That person DID accept payment and these   XXXX     accounts are now paid in full  XXXX      2016 ( attached ).
All the time however, Wells Fargo continued t  o report me as a charged off account hurting my credit scores after I walked in and tried to pay these accounts off in cash!!"
2254,"I paid my card off in full on XX/XX/2020. After payment, Wells Fargo ( XXXX ) charged interest to the card for several months before I noticed. I only knew about it because I checked my credit report. Mail was delayed getting to me due to COVID-19. When I called the company, they admitted that interest was charged 2 days after I paid the card off in full. The interest should have been calculated in the payment amount as was the other fee. The company returned the other fee but refused to removed derogatory information from my credit file. I would like this removed from all 3 credit agencies."
2260,"I believe I opened a secure credit card on XXXX or XXXX of 2014. When I was misled and pushed by the bank officer, after assuring and promising that I will have absolutely right to get unsecured credit card within 6 months time under Wells Fargo business policy. However, I have learned in a hard way that it was not true. Even though, I have never late or miss my payment for a single day since the opening of this account, and also the APR is close to 25 %, I have not gotten yet to this day what I was promising more than 6 years ago. This simply makes me mad as XXXX, because what the bank promising was simply untrue, even I have a credit score between very good and excellent. This is very depressing, because they don't really care, for something that I can not explain and understand. This is unacceptable, unfair and unethical. The opportunity cost of 6 years is beyond incalculable financially and emotionally. Of course, I got a negative yield by any measure. Today, this is particularly true for me, after wating for 6 years. 

Over the entire 6 years period, I spoke with different customer services regarding this issue more than 40 to 50 times, but I have only gotten a lip service saying "" you are not graduating yet, wait a little bit, we will let you know when the time is right ''. I was constantly pleading with them to stop this trend of misleading not to continue forever, but anyone they are doing it. 

Not only this but also they opened awhile ago a new account without my consent, when I found out, they apologize over the phone, and I moved on. Despite of all the bad things, I have continued my business. Now, almost my faith is collapsed. 

Now, I realized that Wells Fargo system becomes a grave concern to me. That is why I am desperately seeking your assistance. 

Sincerely, XXXX"
2261,"I have been a  XXXX  's  Cardholder for 5 yea rs and in that time have always paid my bills on time. I was hospitalized twice and have been out of work for approximately 4 months now due to illness.  XXXX  's used to be managed by  XXXX    XXXX   which  XXXX    XXXX   did offer card security in case of being unemployed, illness, death, etc. I tried calli ng Wells Fargo to exp lain to them my situation and informed them that I was willing to work out a hardship payment plan if possible. The problem that I have with this whole scenario is when I opened this account, I had  XXXX  insurance on the card  XXXX   XXXX  and  for Wells Fargo t o take over accounts and not offer the identical coverage and not inform the customer that they no longer have the coverage is unfair. This is information that a customer needs to know. Until I became ill, I always made sure that my bills were paid on time and m y credit score was  good. I thought that I had coverage and when I was told that I did n't I asked did they have a hardship program of some sort and their response was no and we can do nothing to help you. This is crazy!!!! I tried to explain that even though I 've been a good customer does that no account for anything? The response no sorry ma'am. This is unfair."
2264,"Wells Fargo was charging me a fee for "" interest fee on cash advances '' on my credit card. I had never withdrawn or transferred cash from that account. The charges were incurred monthly, and were in the 30 dollar/ month range. 
When I complained, they said that an "" overdraft protection advance '' was considered a cash advance and that I was being charged interest on that at 26.24 %. If the interest is 33. per month, at that percentage, that would mean I'd have approximately 1500 dollars in overdraft protection advances, which I certainly do not. Now, since I am overdrawn, they apply another fee every month, on top of my regular interest, and I fall deeper and deeper into debt."
2265,"Well Fargo Business Credit Card has a due date on the card of XX/XX/XXXX but had a closing date XX/XX/XXXX. I made a payment XX/XX/XXXX, and they applied to previous statement due to closing date from previous billing cycle being after due date for next billing cycle, and next statement showed I was late with a late fee. I complained and they waived the late charge, but they put up my interest rate up from 15.99 to 29 %. I called and complained when my interest rate was increased. They understood that it was not late when reviewing it, but stated they could not do anything over the phone. They sent me a form to fill out. I did, and sent it certified. I called them and they stated they never received it. However, despite stating they never received it, they sent a response stating they could not put my interest rate down due to me being "" late '' on my payment. I talked to my bank and called back, but they told me I would have to fill out form again, but they had difficulty locating an "" escalation member '' that could send me the form again. This happened again this year. I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX which was the closing date for the previous billing cycle when due date was XX/XX/XXXX. They applied it to previous months payment and now it is showing I am late with a late fee. This is predatory toward businesses and unethical."

My problem was that after I purchased the storm shutters in good faith, the loading crew switched my shutters with another persons shutters. Please be aware that shutters are purchased to fit a particular size window. None of the shutters they loaded me with fit my windows. I returned the next day to inform them of their mistake and I just wanted the shutters I had purchased. I was in formed that n  o manager was available to return the order. Then I was told that I would have to purchase new shutters and speak with a manager about a refund since it was the loaders fault for the mix-up.
I purchased a second set of shutters believing I would get a full refund for the mix-up. No manager responded to my calls as I live out of town and the shutters were for an investment property. I contacted Wells Fargo and they placed a temporarily   credit to the credit card. After some time they reversed the card saying it was a valid purchase and I had no claim because the merchant had signs posted that all sales are final. My argument with them was that I never received the merchandise I purchased, I received someone else shutters, therefore there was no final sale. They  ( Wells Fargo ) informed me  that  XXXX  would do an investigation but when I contacted  XXXX  they had no knowledge o f Wells Fargo ev er requesting a dispute on my behalf. I called  Wells Fargo ba ck and was told it could take up to 6 months for  XXXX  to complete their investigation.

2270,Wells Fargo contacted me about fraudulent charges on my card. They then cancelled my card and told me they would send a new one. They have not sent a new one and I can not access my account online. I waited for my card as instructed for approximately a month before they called and said I was late on my payment. I paid and complained that they had not sent a card and had not given me online access. They also filed a credit report and hurt my credit and charged a late fee. I paid the owed payments including the late fee even though I felt it was unfair. I have been unable to pay because they changed my account number and have not sent me any information on my amended account. It has been a month or so since and they have still not sent a card and have not given me any online access. They have stopped being helpful on the phone and they are now hurting my credit more.

This transaction was done by telephone while I was on the XXXX   website with their agent. After confirming the flight and the ticket price displayed on their website with the agent on that website I agreed to the purchase. I was warned by the agent that once I agreed to the price and she hit the button there was no refund or turning back. I agreed and she proceeded. After about a two minute wait she returned and told me the price increased by {$190.00}! I was less than happy but needed the tickets paid. I then called Wells Fargo to complain about their bait and switch pricing and demanded a refund of my points. They assigned a case # XXXX but would not communicate in writing.

Then in XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Wells Fargo that said they discovered a processing error because they did not have correct address in the system.

The account had no balance and was one of our oldest accounts. I contacted customer service and requested the account be reinstated, as we intended to purchase new appliances within the the next few weeks. Customer Service refused this request and suggested I re-apply for a new line of credit. The closure of this card negatively affects our total credit limit and length of credit history, lowering both our credit ratings."
2289,"This complaint is about my Wells Fargo credit card ending in XXXX. I made the full payment for {$3200.00} on XX/XX/XXXX for the XXXX statement of this card, but the payment wasn't processed until XX/XX/XXXX after contacting Wells Fargo customer service several times. The payment was initiated on the Wells Fargo website using ACH pull from my checking account from another bank, which was the account that I always used in previous months. The Wells Fargo 's website shows that this payment was received on XX/XX/XXXX, and on my bank 's website it is showing the fund left my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. It appears that this payment wasn't processed by Wells Fargo for nearly XXXX weeks. I'd like to remark that the XXXX statement was due on XX/XX/XXXX, and I made the payment more than two weeks before the due date. This delay in processing payment caused some trouble in making subsequent recurring purchase in XXXX, and for which I was then charged for a non-sufficient fund fee."

I have a perfect credit score via the XXXX credit reporting agency they used of XXXX. I believe I was denied due to my age not Credit worthiness. There was a {$300.00} bonus on this credit card if used properly, I believe Wells Fargo was doing a bait and switch scheme."
2293,so wells farro credit card closed my account and they didn't tell me whats the reason for them closing the account and my account was in good standing and i've had the account for over 1 year so they never told me why they closed my account so them closing my account ruined my credit as well
2296,"I opened a new credit card with Wells Fargo and never received my first statement. As a result, I missed the due date on my first bill and was charged a late fee and interest. Because it was my first bill, I had no expectations for when my monthly bill should be due. When I called Wells Fargo, they offered to waive the late fee, but not the interest. They could not provide me with delivery confirmation or detailed mailing information to prove that they ever sent the first statement. They only confirmed that my address was correct."
2297,"I applied for a credit card through Wells Fargo at XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX to take advantage of a promotional payment offer. I was approved and made my payments on time until the balance was {$0.00}. My account was inactive from XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I went to XXXX XXXX for a routine check of my credit. While on the app, I noticed the Wells Fargo store card was reported as closed by consumer. I was nervous as I thought I was a victim of identity theft, so I contacted Wells Fargo by phone to discuss the account closure issue. The phone rep explained that my account was closed by the bank for inactivity. While on the call, I retrieved the XXXX XXXX XXXX agreement ( revision XXXX ) and did not find any clause authorizing Wells Fargo to close the account for cardholder inactivity. I mentioned this to the rep ; she informed me she would escalate my issue to the Executive Department who would review my situation and notify me by mail of their decision. 

One week later, I received a letter from Wells Fargo saying they rejected my request to have the account reopened. I went to the Wells Fargo website to retrieve the credit card agreement and noticed that Wells Fargo made a new revision of their agreement ( revision XXXX ). 

This has negatively impacted my credit in that my credit utilization percentage was increased by this decision. Wells Fargo did not send any notices informing me the account would be closed due to inactivity. I believe Wells Fargo has violated the terms of their credit card agreement with me."
2298,I saw an advertisement of 4 % APR from Wells Fargo Bank and asked them why they don't offer 3 % APR> They emailed me back that I do have 3 % APR. Then I requested {$30000.00} seeing 4 % APR and thinking that I'm eligible for 3 %. They didn't refund the APR - charges back
2299,"Last XX/XX/2018, my credit card limit was only {$1000.00} plus the interest of about {$100.00}. I had used my credit card limit of {$1000.00} only plus the interest of approximately {$100.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX, I could not pay the full amount of interest. Then at the end of the month XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo decided to charge my credit card of approximately {$2500.00} out of nowhere. I called customer service in mid XX/XX/XXXX, spoke to a XXXX, who was of no help. He could not explain the jump of {$1500.00} added on my {$1000.00} credit limit. And every couple of weeks or so, {$100.00} was added and it keeps adding. In mid XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with a couple of women on the phone, last XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, who kept telling me that I had a credit limit of {$2500.00}! I explained my credit card limit of was {$1000.00}, it made no difference to them. They said that I had charges of {$2500.00}. I asked to send me the so called charges. They sent confusing pages of mostly charges and fees. Then recently last XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to another Wells Fargo representative, who could not help me because he didn't know what to say. I'm wondering if they mixed my account with someone elses account. My credit card account was closed about five months ago. But Wells Fargo keeps charging my closed account with fees and charges. Now, my credit card has a balance of {$3000.00}! Now, I have {$2900.00} in charges that I do not owe. 

I am a senior citizen on a fixed income and I would never agree to a {$2500.00} credit limit. I only agreed to a {$1000.00} credit approximately over three years ago. So either Wells Fargo is having a computer glitch, my account was switched with another account, or I am the victim of identity theft."

They have not investigated these charges. I contacted XXXX XXXX to notify their corporate that they are fraudulent and they stated they had not been contacted by anyone about these charges. I demand these charges be removed from my account permanently."

2303,"When making a purchase using the card, I was promised 48 months to pay the balance at a 9.99 % APR. The first statement I received indicates that I was given 12 months at 0 %."
2304,"On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I arrived in the branch to open a business credit card account. I initiated the process online for a Wells Fargo Business Platinum Credit Card with a "" New customer offer : Get a one-time {$500.00} cash back bonus or XXXX bonus points when you enroll in the Business Card Rewards Program and spend {$3000.00} in the first three months of account open date ; {$0.00} annual rewards fee ''. This was shared with the banker to assist. The card application was approved and mailed around XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I have had several inquiries to Wells Fargo regarding the payout of this offer. Including XXXX XXXX and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I even went to the bank where the branch manager assisted calling cardmember services to investigate and resolve the error in payment. The latest communication I have received is "" Our records do not reflect a promotional bonus offer for this account. "" I am quite upset that I fulfilled my obligation and Wells Fargo has not yet lived up to their promise for the promotional terms."
2305,"Wells Fargo Financial National Bank keeps putting a negative remark on my credit reports that is incorrect, not authorized and they keep putting this statement on my credit file. 

This is copied directly from my credit report : This is on my WF/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ACCOUNT DETAILS Account status Closed Individual Remarks Dispute resolved ; consumer disagrees, account closed by consumer The individual remarks are being put on my credit file by this company when I have NEVER DISPUTED THIS ACCOUNT : The account is closed, the account was late due to sickness and loss of job but account is now handled by a debt management company and is current. I am not disputing this, I do not disagree but this company keeps putting these FALSE remarks on my credit files and I want them to be investigated. 

This is not the first time that any entity of Wells Fargo has been caught doing illegal things to consumers. I want this remark to be removed immediately and permanently and I do not want it to keep coming back on my file each month. The only remark should be "" Account Closed by consumer '' All other remarks and dispute codes should be removed and stay removed. 

I will keep filing CFPB complaints each month that Wells Fargo keeps putting these lies on my credit files. I am sick of dealing with this and if you refuse to remove, if you refuse to initiate contact with me I will escalate this complaint to the FTC and the State Attorney Generals office and if I have to sue you in a court of law over you putting these false remarks on my file I will do so.. 

I have contacted them at WF/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, IA XXXX USA ( XXXX ) XXXX And they refuse to call me back or to comply with my request thus this complaint being filed."
2306,"I did not get {$25.00} cash back offer promised by Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX, and have called them multiple times during the weeks of XX/XX/XXXX, and kept getting inconsistent even illogic answers."
2308,"It all started late XX/XX/XXXX when I finally discovered that there were fraudulent credit card purchases made under my name. I was scared because the person that did it was my sister. I then told the Wells Fargo bank that I lost the card but in reality I wanted to get the credit card out of my sister 's possesion. A week after, I finally took the courage to go to my local police station to file a police report against my sister. Next, I went to my local Wells Fargo bank and reported credit card fraud against my sister, who happens to be a manager at Wells Fargo. I found out that this account was opened XX/XX/XXXX. That was a week after my 18th birthday and I was 21 when I found out about this fraudulent account.  The Wells Fargo bank then made their investigations. Months had gone by and I didn't receive an email neither a call regarding my fraud claim. I called the fraud team of Wells Fargo and they gave me the disappointing news that my fraud claim had been denied. They denied it because they said there was money being transferred from a saving account that I had no idea was under my name to this fraudulent credit card account. Once I found out about the savings account I decided to report that as well so the bank could see that I had no idea about that money being transferred neither this credit card. I got them to investigate again, but this time giving them evidence such as police reports, text messages between my sister and I, a letter proving of the places I lived, contact info of other victims, and bank statements. I did this so they could really see that I never opened that account and my sister was guilty. I also wrote them a letter to provide additional information. They called me to get further information. The fraud team of Wells Fargo wanted me to scan my personal information like social security. This made me think that they were getting the idea that it was a fraud. I called them to check the status of this fraud claim and they denied it again. Their next excuse was that there was no new information provided so they considered that I was the person who authorized those charges. That excuse really frustrated me and didn't make sense. I was feeling like they were protecting my sister because she is a team member of theirs. I also felt like they didn't want to own up to the fact that it was fraud because it could make their company look bad and mess up their reputation.

XX/XX/XXXX I sent a letter to the Credit Union explaining my situation of identity theft. They sent me a confirmation letter of certain items removed but they didn't remove the Wells Fargo account that is really affecting my credit. I am still getting notifications about late payments of charges that I am not responsible for. Around {$900.00} is owed for that Wells Fargo credit card."
2313,"On XX/XX/XXXX my credit card statement cut saying I had a minimum payment due of {$38.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. 

After that statement cut, on the same day, I paid the {$38.00} payment, dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I see that I was charged a {$37.00} late fee, and my account is "" Past due '' because they did not receive a payment by XX/XX/XXXX. However, there was a payment on XX/XX/XXXX AFTER the statement was available ( That's how I knew the amount, and clicked "" Payments '' -> '' Minimum Amount Due '' -> '' {$38.00} '' ->Pay ). 


In a panic of the late payment notification, I made a payment for {$110.00}. After going back and looking through my statements, I realized I DID make the payment and was wrongfully charged. 

After escalating to a supervisor, Wells Fargo essentially told me that if I "" wouldn't have made a payment on my statement date, ( I ) wouldn't have this problem ''. WHAT? What kind of credit card company doesn't encourage payments? 

I have credit card accounts at every other bank, and I always make payments on the statement date. I believe this is deceptive and not in consumers ' best interests to be charged fees and be marked "" past due '' when the reality is the payment was made about as "" on time '' as you can get. I've been a Wells Fargo customer ( deposit ) since XX/XX/XXXX, and I'm planning on ending that relationship over a mere {$37.00} and deceptive practices."
2314,"On or about XX/XX/XXXX I went online and agreed to a free offer but had to pay {$1.00} for handling charges. When I gained access to the site, I discovered that it was not what it was suppose to be. I called the number and cancelled the membership. I was billed twice in the amount of {$99.00} after canceling. I disputed the charges with my bank Wells Fargo, after they accepted the claim # XXXX a temporary credit was issued, then on or about XX/XX/XXXX they recharged my account for the credits and said the claim was denied because I authorized the purchase. XXXX XXXX was the claims assistance center person who denied the claim. I called the 800 number to dispute this finding and could not get XXXX XXXX, but the other person I spoke to was rude and said there was nothing I could do I made the charge. I did not authorize these {$99.00} charges, the company I tried to contact directly and was told that I agreed to these future charges I said I cancelled and they said yes but you agreed to pay these fees for other sites as a part of your membership. I did not agree to any other sites, and I am not interested in the content of these sites I told them and they said nothing we can do for you. I was charged twice the {$99.00} and only one credit was issued by Wells Fargo and then recharged only one {$99.00}. Wells refuses to accept any other disputes on this issue and I was cheated out of {$190.00} by this company with a hidden agreement to accept membership in other sites, there refusal to assist in canceling, and Wells Fargo has a Zero liability policy on all their debit cards, but will not honor these disputes and have sided with the fraud company on my agreement to have these amounts charged to my card."
2315,Wells Fargo is reporting a bad credit card account to my credit that I was only an authorized user on and not financially responsible for by definition.
2319,"It is wrong for Wells Fargo to be able to submit incomplete or reports to this agency that does not tell the entire truth. An employee of Wells Fargo, XXXX XXXX wrote a report to me and this agency without doing the proper research. By this, I mean, she failed to listen to the all the phone calls. Why? Why would she be allowed to write an incomplete report and know that she did not listen to all the calls? Why would the company allow her to? The company finally admitted after several months that they made a mistake- this differs a lot from XXXX XXXX first report. Why? Why should this company be allowed to XXXX up - finally admitted to their mistake after I had to push and push for the right final result? Why should employee just be re trained or recoached? These mistake are honesty and integrity - things that can not be coached. The company for months denied by claims in my report but finally were forced to tell the truth and for that I get a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX for this. The companies response is yes we XXXX up but so what. This agency or any other federal agency will not really do any thing with us so the customer is XXXX again. The company should compensate me or offer me so token to make up for this mistake. If I make a mistake, Wells Fargo punishes me or makes me pay a fee for that mistake, but Wells Fargo just retrains their employees and this is that. Well, I am not happy with that upcome."
2320,"I have been patiently waiting on the Bureaus ' response to the written requests I sent with regards to WELLS FARGO BANK with account number XXXX. However, any modes of response or coordination were not taken on their end. They have not complied with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 USC Sections 1681i within the time allowed by law and continued reporting as unverified information which now, given all my attempts to address it directly with the creditor, as wilful negligence and non-compliance with federal statutes."
2321,"Never dealt with Wells Fargo ever. My situation is I was dealing with XXXX XXXX  in XX/XX/XXXX. & XX/XX/2018. I applied with this bank for a credit card so that later I could ask for a balance transfer upon approval. This is the banking style and credit card services that I have been accustomed to. Apparently, this bank has a whole other realm of procedures that they follow. I went in unaware and unprotected not knowing this. The methods they employ seem to set you up for errors. On the online application is an option for a Balance Transfer. I chose it, since I do not lie regarding my banking goals. I filled in the info for this transfer, only as a precursor of things to come as a request. I did all this based on what I did expect from a bank, not on what they would bind me to and impose upon me. All the while I wasn't feeling well. One thing led to another from thereon, as will be seen in my attached documents. When one does not feel well, the fine print doesn't seem important as some Terms & Conditions and options to cancel out, are discovered only after the fact of hitting the application "" Submit '' button. From my correspondence to Wells Fargo, I do not believe they will yield in any way, nor in a compassionate stance. So, I implore this Bureau to do your best for me in regards to contacting them on my behalf, or other helps."

The POA however was only applied to his bank accounts and not his credit card, on account of XXXX XXXX negligence. In XX/XX/XXXX, I learned that he had {$9000.00} of outstanding debt on his credit card and was incurring late fees. I am unable to review the expenditures or get statements on the credit card. In XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Wells Fargo credit card services. They had no record of the XXXX even though the XXXX was on file with the banking side of Wells Fargo. I thereafter submitted the XXXX to Wells Fargo credit card services. XXXX weeks later I called into Wells Fargo to get the XXXX applied to give me access to his credit card expenditures. After 35 minutes of being passed around to different departments at Wells Fargo, I was informed that the POA only allows me to call in to get information on the card ( which I could do without the POA ) but doesnt give me access to XXXX information. Wells Fargo benefits from the situation by allowing customers with cognitive impairments to rack up large amounts of credit card debt and fees, while denying meaningful access to those who have been charged with ensuring fiscal responsibility."

Due to the issues she had with her account Wells Fargo cancelled my credit card I had for 15 years. My history is clean and I make my payments on time. I think this is an arbitrary decision on their part and they took it without even trying to contact me first."

The statement also said we were past due in the amount of {$25.00}, and had a minimum payment due of {$140.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. From this point on we made regular payments on the first of the month starting in XX/XX/XXXXin the amount of {$79.00}, and they continued to assess us late fees of {$37.00} and interest charges claiming we were in violation of our agreement with them. As of XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  claims we are past due in the amount of {$620.00} even though we have made good faith payments for the original monthly amount due of {$79.00}. This claim by XXXX is also affecting my credit rating.

I have had this account for over 10 years receiving multiple credit limit increases. The card limit was decreased during a time where my credit score increased significantly. My Wells Fargo account payment history, usage, and credit history has only gotten better over the past 24 months and most recently. I always pay more than the amount due and pay on time. It's my understanding that Wells Fargo is providing assistance to customers during this pandemic so even if a payment was recently made late ( I have not made any recent late payment ) why would Wells Fargo wait until now to decrease my limit? I believe that this action is unwarranted and discriminatory."

2352,"I'm filing this report because I am a victim of identity theft. I came to the US, to the state California at the end of XXXX of XXXX as an immigrant. On XX/XX/XXXX, my social security which I barely had received was used in the state of Arizona inside of a Wells Fargo Branch to open a fraudulent account for an identity thief. The identity thief used my social security to open multiple accounts with Wells Fargo. They opened a business checking account, a credit card account. I discovered about this issue in XXXX because I never knew that these accounts existed. Since then I've contacted Wells Fargo and informed them that this is an identity theft case and I am not the holder of these accounts. I have never been to Arizona to open such an account and I did explain this to the Wells Fargo representatives over the phone. They told me they will take care of the issue and resolve it. However, I recently started to check again and Wells Fargo have not done anything. The accounts are still reporting. Therefore, I contacted them and informed them of the issue they keep telling me that I am responsible for the accounts. I informed them that these accounts were opened as a result of identity theft in the state of Arizona because I have never been to Arizona. So when I spoke with the representatives of the executive fraud team, I requested the original application that was used in the state of Arizona when opening these accounts. They had difficulties providing the document but they sent it to me and I will attach it in this report. The documents are Record of Application Information and Credit Card Application and Agreement. There is one thing that I did notice is that my signature was forged but not perfectly. I also informed the Wells Fargo executive fraud team supervisor, however, Wells Fargo does not conduct the proper procedures to remove and purge these accounts. I have never associated with Wells Fargo I informed them with that also. As a matter of fact, I never used a credit card in my entire life. Even now I do not use credit cards. They tried to investigate with me when they saw I my credit report that I had bought vehicles. I told them I buy my vehicle cash and leave 5 to 10 percent for payments so I can build a credit. My transactions are cash and nothing more. I only have a checking account with XXXX  XXXX XXXX and that is my only account. Under the Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of financial crimes enforcement network paragraph ( a ) ( 2 ) ( i ) ( B ) and ( C ) the bank must follow the procedures of verifying the individual before opening any account for a consumer by verifying their name, date of birth, address of residency and check for a valid identification. At XX/XX/XXXX I did not have a valid identification in the State of California yet because I was new to the country and did not know the procedures yet. At that time, I barely had my social security. Wells Fargo opened and became accomplice in an identity theft when they opened the account in Arizona. Plus, Wells Fargo have a history of opening fraudulent accounts under consumer names illegally without their consent and authorization. Wells Fargo have a precedent in gaming practices against them. Whilst I understand that {$1400.00} might not be much however, the account is not mine because I never associated with Wells Fargo. I am not requesting another investigation to be conducted because Wells Fargo is a biased bank the record of application alone can serve as sufficient evidence that I was not the individual that opened the account. Per Wells Fargo 's claim the account was opened in XXXX, AZ at a branch with an individual present. However, I have never been to XXXX, AZ to this day and they can check the public records if I have ever set foot in AZ. To my expertise, this account was either opened by an identity thief that impersonated me or Wells Fargo Credit Card Bankers conducted illegal gaming practices and opened an accounts without my permission by forging signatures and creating falsified checks to protect their investments so their shares are not diluted."

To complete XXXX taxes our accountant needs the credit card transactions for XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX in a format that can be imported by his accounting software ( e.g. 
csv format ). 

Logging into Wells Fargo 's on-line system we are able to view all accounts on-line. 
There is an option to retrieve transactions both as pdf statements as well as csv files, when that format is required. 

We have tried to retrieve the csv files for the 3 credit cards on that account for transactions from XX/XX/XXXX to end of XX/XX/XXXX. When the downloads complete the only data provided is for XX/XX/XXXX up to the current date. 

After calling Wells Fargo to complain about this issue we are told that those transactions are no longer available and the only information available to us are the pdf files which cover all of XXXX. 

It it is inconceivable that Wells Fargo deletes credit card transactions more than 5 months old from its database, which is what we were told. 

This appears to be a matter of Wells Fargo instituting an arbitrary cut-off period for which it generates the csv data required by its customers for the previous year. 

Many individual 's would likely need that information for tax purposes and having someone renter the data from the pdf files that Wells Fargo makes available is costly and time consuming. 

We would appreciate CFPB 's view on this matter.

2356,"Every month when my payment is due I'm locked out of my account and get transferred to numerous places and countries trying to get access. They never gave me my store card so I have no idea what the number is. This is now the 4th month, 3rd since escalating to the "" executive department '' that this has happened. I still do not have any idea what the card number is and can not get access to my account. I'm not XXXX I write down the login and passcode and it works right up til a day or so before the bill is due. It is my belief that they are doing this intentionally. They promised to waive the late fees on this and didn't and none of the issues have yet to be resolved. I ask to speak with managers and they tell me Wells Fargo doesn't have any. Please help."
2357,I have 0 % interest balance transfers and I made a purchase so I was being charged interest on that purchase. I paid my minimum payment plus more than the purchase but Wells Fargo applied the entire payment to my 0 % balances. The manager read me the formula that Wells Fargo uses. The manager said the reason the purchase balance wasn't paid off was because it was in the same billing cycle. My understanding of the Card Act is that there isn't an exception for that. Is there?
2359,"I 've had a credit card with Wells Fargo for over XXXX  years, and just found out it the account was closed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I have not used the card for over XXXX years, and when I called the Credit Card services division of Wells Fargo to inquire about the status of the card after finding out from a branch banker that it was n't active, I was told that the account had been "" closed by the consumer ''. I am the consumer, and I absolutely did not close this account. After further requests, I was later told the account was actually closed due to lack of use, something I was absolutely never made aware was impending or had been completed, despite the claim from Wells Fargo that they sent XXXX letters on separate occasions to notify me of their intent to close this account. 
I am aware of the benefits of having long standing good credit, and this card was XXXX of the primary tools I 've had in my credit portfolio for over a decade. I currently am in possession of a Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX card that does not expire until XXXX XXXX, and am fortunate I did n't attempt to use this card as it has been closed for almost a year and a half without my knowledge."
2361,I have now had an issue with my Wells Fargo credit card for over a month. I contacted them at least XXXX times trying to resolve the fraudulent charges that were made on my card that did not belong to me but they keep denying my claim for the dispute. I have told them multiple times I did not have my card when these transactions were made and I explained to them which transactions were mines but they continue to deny my claim and the issue of the disputed charges all remains unresolved. Charges since XX/XX/2022 when my card was lost and the amount of almost {$2000.00}. The representatives who I spoke with who are supposed to be the higher level reps in the executive office all sound like they are foreigners and are hard to understand. They are very unprofessional and when I asked their information for my own records they refused such as they refused to provide me with a last name for anyone I spoke to. They tell me it will investigated 10 - 15 days and each time I get nowhere with them and I am still being charged and now the credit card is overlimit because of the fraud charges and they still wont resolve anything! Wells Fargo Cash card is the absolute worst
2365,"I did not authorize XXXX. I authorized XXXX They made a mistake. The Wells Fargo representative lied to me and said that the online transaction was declined and did not go through. If a Wells Fargo balance transfer experts tells me that a transaction was DECLINED, as they clearly say, then this is their fault. If she hadn't lied to me, I wouldn't have done another transaction. 

They can not just send money to companies and hold me accountable for it. It is not my responsibility to get my money back for Wells Fargo. If they sent money to a company that I did not authorize, they are welcome to contact that company and get their money back. 

This is crazy ; what is to stop Wells Fargo from doing this repeatedly by having their customer service team lie to their customers, so they get double the amount of balance transfers completed?!"
2368,"I initiated a 0 % balance transfer with Wells Fargo in XXXX of XXXX. I have since been using the card for some purchases. Every month I pay the minimum balance and the additional amount I charged on the card for that month. Wells Fargo is applying both my minimum payment and the additional payment to the 0 % portion and not toward the higher interest rate of 22.15 %. The Credit Card Act of 2009 mandates credit card companies to apply the payment above the minimum payment toward the highest interest rate. Instead they are applying to the 0 % rate, and I keep getting charged interest every month."
2372,"I have an XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card issued by Wells Fargo Bank NA. I recently purchased wedding/engagement rings totaling {$19000.00} on XX/XX/2019. The special financing they have was zero down, 9.99 % with equal payments over 60 months. On XX/XX/2019, an account statement was generated showing a payment due on XX/XX/2019 in the amount of {$410.00}. {$410.00} x 60 payments equals {$24000.00}. When amortizing the amount financed over 60 months with equal payments of {$410.00}, this translates into an APR of about 10.5 %. Using an exact days method of accruing interest, for it to be 9.99 % APR, the payment should be {$410.00}. This is only {$4.00} per month, but over the life of the loan, its {$280.00} of what appears to be over charged interest. 

I called Wells Fargo customer service on XX/XX/2019 and was told, at multiple levels, that all they know is they have a "" payment factor '' of 2.1465 % and refused to provide any additional information on how the equal installments were being computed as well as refused to provide any sort of amortization detail to prove out the payments. 

The 9.99 % APR they claim they offer is not 9.99 % and although minor in dollars at the individual borrower, it is significant if you multiply it by hundreds or thousands of individual borrowers."
2373,"On Friday, XX/XX/2020 my Wells Fargo business credit card was stolen. I called Wells Fargo immediately on the morning of Friday, XX/XX/2020 and reported my credit card stolen. The police department was called as well and a report was made. Given that both my credit card and California State Driver 's License were stolen - the report was considered identity theft. 

Although I promptly reported the theft of my credit card to Wells Fargo - Wells Fargo included a charge in the amount of {$1500.00} that was made on XX/XX/2020 in my XX/XX/2020 credit card statement. This is the first indication that I received from Wells Fargo that this charge is being considered a valid charge on my credit card. I did not make this charge. This charge was made after my credit card and driver 's license were stolen. This information was relayed to Wells Fargo - in addition to the police report details & police officer contact information. However Wells Fargo has not removed this charge from my statement and has denied my fraud claim and has not given adequate explanation as to why my claim has been denied."
2374,"There were XXXX unrecognized charges on my bank account. I immediately reported the charges to my bank, they investigated and gave me the credit. I then get a letter explain they are taking the credit back because the merchant responded. They said the packages were delivered to my house and have a signed signature. I was out of state at the time and no one in my house hold signed anything. They used the courier usps. Ive made purchases before where merchants use usps and every single delivery says signed even though I have not signed anything because it is not required. I reported the card as lost. Because that was the case. I have no packages, I have no items, I dont even know what they are. I have no number to contact the merchant. My bank wont let me appeal theyre decision. They refuse to help me, they tell me to contact the merchant. I have no way to contact the merchant. And even If I did, the merchant isnt going to help me. They believe this transaction isnt Fraud and I did indeed make the purchase and received the items. But on my end I didnt make any purchase and that why I called me bank to get a new card. Because its fraud, so how does Wells Fargo expect me to resolve this, its their job to protect me and have my back when something like this happens. Now theyre treating me like XXXX! Unbelievable."
2375,"The company is reporting incorrect information on my credit report and refuses to remove it, even though it is demonstrably incorrect. Specifically, the company is reporting that I made one late payment in XX/XX/XXXX. This payment was not late. In XX/XX/XXXX, I requested that the company opt me into automatic payments and that the company provide a credit interest refund to my account. The company provided the credit interest refund. They confirmed via phone during this conversation that the automatic payments were indeed set up, but I later found out that they were not."
2376,"Wells Fargo sent me 3 Super Checks in XX/XX/XXXX. All the checks have cleared their ACH and was posted to every account that I submitted them to. Wells Fargo has contacted all the depositors and took the money back. These were no longer checks since they were now credited to my XXXX Credit Card as a payoff and XXXX XXXX as a payoff in which both accounts should have been zero balance and The XXXX XXXX should have closed the account because it was paid in full. two days later The XXXX XXXX took the payment off. The account was paid in full on XXXX XXXX and they took the payment off the account on XXXX XXXX with no notification nor permission. As for what they have done is took their money and gave it to Wells Fargo because my account was paid in full, which means it was closed and i owe nothing to XXXX XXXX nor XXXX because both checks cleared. XXXX XXXX XXXX stole my {$6000.00} out of my account also. they need to replace it back immediately. they did not have my permission to go into my account in XX/XX/XXXX and touch nor take my money for themselves and no one else unless there was a court order sign by a judge. I requested to see the court order. they did not have one. they rob me. I have been contacting the bank and going in person since XXXX XXXX trying to get the front and back copy of all 3 checks. # XXXX and XXXX every wells fargo employees in escalation, credit card and customers service departments have all stated they do not see those checks to send me the copies. I am entitled to the checks and a written reason why Wells Fargo took back the money from the merchants without notifying me the first party. The Insufficient Funds that XXXX XXXX stated that customer service will deposit into my checking account has not been done yet. this was to be done in XXXX. I need answers to all the discrepancy that Wells Fargo has done from XX/XX/XXXX to present. NO RESOLUTION. By the way XXXX XXXX has their XXXX Account with Wells Fargo, this is the reason they reverse the paid in full payment off the account and open the account back open and then make the check as an insufficient fund check although the account had been paid in full as cash which ended my obligation to this entity. since this company enjoy violating customers rights itis only fair, they suffer their consequences for favoritism. XXXX XXXX should have done the right thing and told Wells Fargo if they have a issue with the customer, they have to settle it with her. the account is closed, and they do not have authorization to reverse the money off the account unless the customer is here in person with proper identification to prove her identity. this is the only time we can reverse cask payment because the cash hit the account on the XXXX, and you come on the XXXX which is to late for the payment to be reverse. you see ACH can not take a cleared check and put it back through, this is exactly what these two banks are trying to tell us. except i know better. the only check goes back through is the ones that is rejected. this one did not, the cash was made available on the same day because the company deal with the same bank. If The XXXX XXXX has a Lock Box, the check clear immediately and I think they do and if not, the check was presented and cleared and Wells Fargo and XXXX Know this is exactly what happen."
2378,"Wells Fargo opened a credit card with {$35000.00} line of credit without my knowledge or approval as far back as 2004 ( when I was XXXX years old ) the credit card currently has a debt owed of {$10000.00} and is being used and paid to varying degree every single month. Wells Fargo will not give me access to the account, and will not close it or give me access to it or information about it. I became aware of the issue with XXXX. It has negatively effecting my credit score for almost 20 years. I am not a Wells Fargo client."
2380,I have applied for a Wells Fargo credit card numerous times and have credit scores in the 700 's and continue to get denied. I have friends that have credit scores that are much lower and have negative items on their credit report are getting approved. I feel that Wells Fargo picks and chooses applicants unfairly due to their demographics. I feel that I have been discriminated against by Wells Fargo. I have 3 checking accounts with them over 5 years and maintain good balances.
2382,"Wells Fargo, XXXX. XXXX XXXX sent a pre-paid debit MasterCard that was not ask for and this card had a balance ( {$370.00} ). Various calls to telephone numbers ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX only got computer voice with the select a number. No valid information received due to the card was not activated and a PIIN not selected. Wells Fargo does not have a financial facility in Hawaii. I have the paperwork received, the card in a folder labeled "" fraud ''. Today 's date is XX/XX/2018. This prepaid ( non-reloadable ) is considered a mass-mailing to create accounts at Wells Fargo and this practice should be stopped. I would appreciate a letter from Well Fargo stating that any account created has been "" close '' and there will be no future attempts to create accounts under my name, address for any financial transaction. Well Fargo should also remove my name from any "" prescreened '' offers of credit from this company. I may be reached at XXXX."
2385,"I applied for a Wells Fargo credit card online and intended to transfer {$20000.00} to the new card. I was not shown what my line of credit would be until after submitting the application and it ended up being {$2500.00} and I was not given an opportunity to refuse the card after that point ( unlike other applications I had completed online ). 

I called Wells Fargo to cancel my application and was told I could not. That I needed to wait until the card came and then call the number on the back to cancel it. 

When the card came, I tried to cancel it but Wells Fargo had already transferred {$1900.00} from my other account. An account which I did not provide details about ( account number, etc. ) other than bank name and an amount that I did not authorize. 

I called Wells Fargo to get the money returned and they stated I had to work with my other card to get the funds transferred back and it could take up to 90 days but that in the meantime, i was responsible for making payments on the Wells Fargo card."
2388,Thee were 5 fraudulent charges on my credit card and numerous fraudulent charges on a debit card that was never used.

2391,"I have had a Wells Fargo credit card for almost 2 and a half years. It's a secured card. When Inopened the account, I was told the would be graduated to an unsecured card after 12 months of ontime payments and the balance is paid in full every month. I did that for 18 months straight. When they were questioned about why it had not graduated, 3 different reps gave 3 different excuses. I finally quit paying the balance in full every month because they kept giving me excuses. I even got an unsecured card from XXXX XXXX XXXX for the same limit as my Wells Fargo secured card. Furthermore, they have increased my limit by {$100.00} 2 months after getting the card. Yet, Wells Fargo refuses to graduate the card. This is false and misleading so they can keep and pocket the security deposit or not pay the interest on the deposit as they had promised. Finally, there have been times where Wells Fargo does not report it to my credit bureaus unless I complain. This needs to stop before I contact a lawyer and go to all of the media outlets. The reps have even been rude and abrasive when questioned about these issues. One rep stated if I don't like it, they can close the account and I can go somewhere else!! Really??!!"
2393,"Wells Fargo closed my credit card account a month ago with no forewarning while it had a negative credit balance of {$54000.00}. They have since sent me a check for only {$1800.00}, while the remaining balance is still missing. The bank claims to have refunded that money to a separate bill payment company, whom I have called, and they have told me they have no record of the money being received. Wells Fargo has not provided any reference numbers for me to track down this money or determine how to find the money. 

According to 12 CFR 1026.11 ( a ) ( 2 ) - ( 3 ), the bank is required to refund a negative balance within 7 days of my request, and only by "" cash, check, or money order, or credit to a deposit account of the consumer ''. None of these methods of refund were utilized by Wells Fargo. Additionally, I have requested this money be returned for a month now and the bank has not made a good faith effort to return the money to me within the timeframe listed in the statute. I have left voicemails, sent emails, and sent letters via USPS mail all to no avail."

They have send a letter stating "" application is denied due to Amount of credit requested combined with existing debt is too high related to stated household income ) ''. 

Bank and its employees can not punish me for their inability to talk to a customer."
2403,I recently applied for a credit card. The card was denied to me by your bank. Please see the reason ( s ) provided by your company. It appears the reasons are based off actions your company established such as accounts you closed. Closed accounts closed by bank should not be counted as negative. Please be specific as to which portions of my credit report were used and which accounts you used in your consideration if any and what information about the accounts you used. Please open requested credit card account immediately. Thank You

2406,"Fees charged to business semi annually, because they have not had any activity of any customer using a XXXX, XXXX XXXX or any card during this period. My company accepts all major credit cards, but mostly they use Visa, MasterCard, If they have other cards we accept them also, I feel it is unfair to a business owner to charge them a fee because no activity of a certain credit card was used during this time period, A Business can not help what type of card a person has, we pay, as it is, for the cards we do take. Why should we pay for a card that someone didn't have, to me this is so wrong and I am being charged for something I have no control over, if this is the case, I will be forced not to .take any card except debit with my bank. To me this is the same as stealing money from a company, because someone didn't use a credit card."
2408,"I had filed a complaint with Wells Fargo for charges that were not made by me or authorized by me. The person who took the card was an adult son. He is not on the account and was not allowed to use the card on his own. Wells fargo is asserting that he was authorized and that is not correct. I have filed a police report as soon as I could regarding the occurrence - with XXXX County Sheriff Department case XXXX. 

I had a difficult to use card, replaced. The card had issues with both the strip and the chip. I had thrown the card away in a trash compactor. Apparently, the individual took it out of the compactor without my awareness, and cleaned it from the food I had compacted on top from the fridge and put it back together somehow. I noticed utilization of this card when receiving an email indicating the card was being used 20 miles north of my location. I had called the XXXX XXXX to investigate the charge and the manager recalled the thief as the "" card was very hard to use ''. She furthermore described him. After careful inspection of the statement this person used my card in locations I may use it. To be undetected. But also places I had not gone. Like a tire shop, vape store, XXXX, as burger, XXXX.. XXXX, XXXX charges totalling over {$1200.00}. This individual moved and went crazy with a card he put back together. After confronting him he admitted to taking the card prior to destruction from my wallet and returning it undetected, and later taking the card when it was disposed of. 

Wells Fargo Credit Card comes with Zero Liability at no extra cost. Its built-in protection features ensure that you wont be held responsible for any unauthorized transactions, as long as they're reported promptly. 

They were reported as soon as noticed. It takes time here to get the police report, etc. Wells fargo is not holding to their agreement. The charges I had highlighted were indeed fraud."
2410,Received offer for {$6000.00} Line of credit @ 0 % interest for 18 months. 3 % Balance transfer. None of my transfers are going through because none of my transfers are being paid. However my balance on my transferred account is showing only {$900.00} is available at this time even though the account was originally {$6000.00} This is the work of WELLSFARGO.
2413,"Wells Fargo charged a late fee on my credit card on the date the payment was due. I saw the additional {$25.00} on my balance and there was no activity whatsoever. Not one person I spoke with could tell me what the {$25.00} additional balance due was. I closed my account due to the extreme hassle of having to do business with Wells Fargo. I found out a week later that the charge was actually a late fee, posted on XX/XX/2018. My minimum payment was due on XX/XX/2018. I was online to make the payment when I saw the additional balance ( I had not used the card in over a month ) and tried to find out what it was. See attached copy of my XX/XX/XXXX statement which shows my payment due on the XXXX of each month and the late fee posted on XX/XX/2018."
2415,"I ordered a product in XX/XX/2021 never received it, have been injured and unable to work or make the full payments. Have had the company I made purchase from refund the purchase however Wells Fargo has refused to refused the past 18 months of interest or readjust the minimum payments and balance. They have even gone as far as to label me a risk and freeze the card and try to add on tons of late fees to their behalf. Wouldnt let me do a promissory note for payment as they claimed I wasnt working but Im still employed just not currently working. This banking institution needs to be disbanded and removed, nothing but deceitful business practices and lies. Gave me XXXX cents refund for 18 months x XXXX a month interest plus the crazy late fees and have jacked up my minimum payment from XXXX a month to XXXX a month. 

They are completely aware of my situation and told me to borrow the money from my family all while refusing to work with me."
2416,"My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I am sending this request myself to address the inaccuracies on my Credit Reports. I'm not swayed that Bureaus efficiently pleased the principles of the Fair Credit Reporting Act in completing their investigation. The 3 Bureaus are reporting inaccurate information on WELLS FARGO CARD SER. Per FCRA, reporting must be 100 % accurate or the information must be deleted. 

WELLS FARGO CARD SER XXXX Balance {$1100.00}"
2417,"In XXXX Wells Fargo was contacted to file a claim for a credit card benefit on an account that turned out to established under mis-information provided by the bank. 

The claim was rejected as a result of having a debit card issued by the bank as opposed to the the requested credit card. Although I requested a credit card, the Wells Fargo banker insisted I take a debit card and indicated that all the benefits on the credit card were applicable to the debit card. Upon making a first claim seven years later the claim was declined as the benefit was only applicable to the credit card. 

A follow up was send to the CFPB under case number # XXXX. 

The case was purportedly investigated, denied and closed by the bank and they informed me in writing that the results of their investigation could not be shared. 

So far the Wells Fargo has transferred me to about a dozen individuals and different divisions in the Executive Office call center. All that has been offered is the opportunity to ( now ) apply for a credit card and nothing regarding the card benefit to provide mobile phone repairs. I am seeking the {$270.00} for repair of the phone I was also informed in the past two weeks that the Visa logo on the debit card does not have any significance other than branding. I found this to be mis-leading and supports my contention that the Wells Fargo employee did not understand the features of the card that was not requested yet ordered. 

It is now being requested that the CFPB review the complaint process used by Wells Fargo as it could amount to stonewalling by virtue of investigative results that will not be shared and the use of a Visa logo. The net result is to receive the benefits as informed by a Wells Fargo and payment of {$270.00} to repair a phone where the monthly cell provider has billed the credit/debit card for over seven years, a requirement of the benefit. 

Thank you"
2420,I just filed Complaint XXXX for the exact same reason when I got a call From Wells Fargo stating they are also voiding my new card the number I will enclose for the exact same reason.
2422,"I received a promotional offer for a Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Included in this promotional offer was a {$300.00} cash for {$3000.00} in charges during the first 3 months. Wells Fargo included fine print that said that I am not eligible if I received another promotion during the preceding 15 months. Wells Fargo had this information at the time Wells Fargo solicited my credit card business. Wells Fargo determined that I was not eligible for this promotion, but they accepted my application for the card and did not inform that I was not eligible for the promotion. Wells Fargo should not solicit credit applications from people using a promotion that they are not available to receive when Wells Fargo has that information at the time of the solicitation. Worse, Wells Fargo should inform accepted cardholders that responded to a promotion that they are ineligible to receive, that they are ineligible to receive it. Wells Fargo is comfortable that they solicit credit applications from potential customers that are ineligible for the advertised promotion and does not feel the need to disclose their determination of ineligibility to the accepted applicants. This is wrong. I informed Wells Fargo Credit Card executive office, and they are comfortable with both the misleading solicitation and the lack of disclosure. This was confirmed to me by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2019."
2426,I called into the call center and made a payment arrangement to pay off the balance in full. I requested a payment to run for XXXX on XXXX  XX/XX/22. Because this would have fallen on my payroll date. I requested the payment to be taken out on my Checking account. Instead they processed the payment on an earlier date XX/XX/22. I called the customer service number XXXX. I advised them of the payment coming out of my account early and I advised that I was also charged a XXXX return check fee from my back. This has over drafted my checking account. They were not interested in making this right and proceeded to advised me that they want payment and would not refund me the full payment and would not be giving me the XXXX I was changed because of it. This is putting me into a hardship situation. The money I did have in my account was to pay for the temporary housing I'm currently living in. Without this money I will be homeless. I'm wanting the funds refunded to me ASAP. I also want the XXXX that was taken early and the XXXX Nsf fee charged by my credit union refunded. As well has any other charges that I may incur because of the mistake. I'm requesting that this item be deleted from my Credit report. Also I'm requesting Wells Fargo bank to Cease and Desist.
2427,"I received a credit card from Wells Fargo around XXXX. About a XXXX into having the card I had difficulties figuring out my payments as they were changing. I was receiving notices saying I wasnt paying on time or the right amount but never received confirmation that they were being edited. 
I ended up borrowing money from a family member to pay off the card and close the account. Relieving my stress of the situation."
2429,"XXXX XXXX I applied for a credit card with Wells Fargo. I did so because this card offered a balance transfer option for 0 % for 18 months. I have a XXXX card with a large balance. XXXX approved me but for only a {$5000.00} credit limit. That was not enough to pay off the XXXX card balance. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2019 I called XXXX to activate my new card and I instructed them to NOT make the balance transfer since I couldnt pay the entire balance. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX made the balance transfer anyway. On XXXX XXXX, a payment of {$4500.00} was posted on my XXXX card. The balance on my XXXX card is {$4600.00}. I did not want to transfer part of the balance where I would have XXXX accounts open with XXXX payments to make. 
I talked to XXXX earlier this week asking them to credit my XXXX card with a payment for {$2300.00} ( 50 % of what they charged me ) and I would assume the other half. They refused. They also told me that they had reached out to XXXX and asked the to refund the payment that XXXX made to them. XXXX refused. 
My current stance is that I want XXXX to refund to me the entire balance of {$4600.00}. That is my money they spent that I didnt authorize."
2431,"I had originally lost my credit card and reported fraud for transactions that I did not authorize ( XX/XX/XXXX ). For some reason, transactions dating from XXXX  months back were also reported as fraud, causing me to lose business from multiple merchants. After attempting to resolve the issue multiple times during the course of the next XXXX  weeks with my bank, I still owed XXXX on the credit card. This amount was very incorrect and the customer service representative at the time agreed and reassured me multiple times that I would be receiving a check for the amount of XXXX so that I may manually deposit it and use the funds to pay off most of the amount owed on the credit card. Unfortunately no check was ever received and after contacting the customer service line again on XX/XX/XXXX, the case was escalated to the customer advocacy group and made it clear that I had not received the check and also repeating various times that I could not afford to pay the amount owed. For some reason, Wells Fargo forcefully removed XXXX from my savings account to pay the amount owed on my credit card. In no way shape or form did I ever authorize the transfer to be made but it was. I appreciate your time and help with this. Thank you."
2433,"I made an online payment from my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account on XX/XX/2019, it was posted to my Wells Fargo Bank Secured Credit Card XX/XX/2019. However, my {$250.00} payment has been on hold and will continue to be on hold until XX/XX/2019, unless I fax proof the payment debited my checking account. In the meantime, I wonder if I am being charged 28 % apr everyday my payment is on hold and how long WFB has been processing my payments this way and to how many others. In the meantime, WFB is earning interest on my payment and not making my credit available to me for use. I had to fax a copy of my bank statement with my name and account number as well as my credit card number for them to release the hold on my credit limit. ( which I did today )"
2436,"I have an old expired XXXX  provided by Wells Fargo Bank. It is for back child support. We thought the funds were exhausted, but got notice there is a balance of {$110.00}. I would like the balance, but the card has expired. 

I have spent over five hours today on hold. One hour this morning, and two hours twice this afternoon waiting to speak to someone about a replacement of an expired card. It is the same loop saying I am in the cue, but no one picks up. I went online to see if I could order a replacement card, but XXXX  requires replacement cards on the phone only. I can see the balance, but can not order a card. I realize it is special circumstances with Covid-19, but this many hours on hold is unacceptable. I went in person to Wells Fargo bank to ask if they can order new card or give me the balance on the card and they said no. I had to call for the replacement card. 

Thank you for any help."
2437,"I am obtaining legal help in this matter. After receiving Wells Fargo 's response to my complaint, I have no choice. The original case # is XXXX. 
Wells Fargo states that being as all of my balances have the same APR, any payment I make in excess of the minimum amount will be split among the balances. This IS NOT in the Agreement and Disclosure that they sent me, and it was NEVER in any disclosure or information on the paperwork when I used their "" Supercheck '' offers. It was only in the current letter that they sent me. It was not disclosed initially until now. 
I have been paying extra each month to pay off the balance that is due the earliest. Their practice makes this impossible and is only in favor of their institution. It is not in the favor of the consumer, quite the opposite. Also, as I said it was not disclosed initially. Please see page 11, 2nd paragraph. which states : "" Generally, we will apply your Minimum payment first to lower APR balances before balances with higher APR 's. Payments made in excess of the Minimum Payment will be applied to balances with higher APR 's first before balances with lower ones '' I'm sure there are many other people who find this peculiar and downright illegal. I hope to bring it to the light."
2438,"I had a problem with the propel XXXX card from Wells Fargo. That credit card had a special program covering my purchases, airline tickets, etc. That program was covered by XXXX XXXX XXXX, a member insurer of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. It was just an insurance policy, but the feature sponsored by Wells Fargo Bank. According to the credit card 's terms and conditions all disputes were supposed to be resolved via arbitration with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). When I filed my dispute with the XXXX respondent refused to follow its own policy, terms, and conditions. The XXXX closed the case with demand to remove its name from Wells Fargo Bank terms and conditions. Wells Fargo Bank ignored that request and still publishes XXXX as the only place all disputes must be arbitrated."
2439,"I typically have no problem with credit cards because 1 ) I am a high income individual 2 ) with a relatively high credit score and 3 ) almost no debt since I have a paid for house with no mortgage or rent expense. I have an extremely low available credit on my Wells Fargo Visa card. My credit limit is only {$4000.00}. I have contacted the bank on multiple occasions in an attempt to raise the available credit on this card. However, I believe that I am a victim of XXXX discrimination. As a person of middle eastern descent I am offended at the corrupt business practices of Wells Fargo. The bank consistently engages in unethical disclosures that are misleading. When I provided my income information to the bank I was immediately offered a {$1000.00} increase in my available credit. However, I refused this offer. This was significantly less than my requested increase in the credit limit. I was told that my information would be sent to another department to review my request in order to secure a more significant increase in the available credit. I was told to call back in 2 hours. Unfortunately, when I called back in 2 hours I learned that the bank ignored my request to have a significant increase in the credit limit. Wells Fargo ignored my request and simply increased the available credit by an unacceptable {$1000.00}. I am constantly asked to navigate the banks inefficient and unproductive voice mail mazes only to be disappointed with term conversations with incompetent customer service agents. The last customer service agent told me that he was "" making a note that I requested someone from Wells Fargo call me ''. When I asked when a Wells Fargo representative would contact me, he confessed that no one would actually call. He confessed that he was merely "" making a note '' in my account. The Wells Fargo representative eventually agreed that this comment was misleading. It seems reasonable that his comment indicated someone would contact me. I am extremely upset that Wells Fargo does not value high income individuals that don't happen to be traditional rich white men. I am tired of the constant scandals and lies from Wells Fargo. I expect to be treated better. The bank needs to contact me to discuss my request to have my credit limit increased. Wells Fargo seems to hate talking to customers who aren't traditional rich white men."
2441,"Around XXXX I started out with a credit line of {$5000.00} on a Wells Fargo Bank credit card. I used it and after paying the balance down to almost half around XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo reduced my credit line from to {$2400.00}. I called them to request that it be restored and was told by a representative that I had missed a payment in XX/XX/XXXX as the reason for the reduction. It was an oversight and actually the payment was about 45 days late when I paid it in full. The bank refused to restore my credit line. By the end of XXXX I paid the balance down to about {$1100.00} and on XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo reduced my credit line down to {$950.00}. Each time they reduced my credit line my utilization percent went up and therefore hurt my credit score. None of my other creditors have done this. 
How can a consumer be protected from this?"
2443,"My Wells Fargo credit cards was closed on XX/XX/22 due to a delinquent mark. I received a letter which stated this. 

I've investigated the mark with XXXX  XXXX XXXX and it's since been solved. All credit bureau 's have been notified and the mark has been removed. 

I've opened a case with Wells Fargo on the XXXX of XXXX and have been calling back weekly to get an update. I have not been assigned a case manager in the two weeks. Yesterday a woman had told me the card was closed due to inactivity. The card was last used 4 months ago. I submitted a complaint via XXXX   and today I was finally able to be transferred to the "" Wells Fargo Executive Credit '' department. XXXX from this department said this was a business decision and the card will not be re-opened. I stated I never received ANY sort of warning, especially if it was for inactivity. My rewards points were stripped and I would not be receiving them. XXXX stated there is nothing more I can do. 

I've had this credit card for 10 years and had ZERO marks in my entire credit history. I believe I'm being unfairly treated and entitled to a case manager to actually investigate."
2444,"On XX/XX/2019 my Wells Fargo credit card billing cycle restarts. 

I checked my account on my mobile app, it listed my available credit at {$5.00} I know that when my next billing cycle begins, the interest charges are applied soon after, but they had not been posted on my account yet. 

So, acting in good faith, I make a deposit on XX/XX/2019 and I use the money I deposited to my Wells Fargo checking account to make a {$50.00} payment to the Wells Fargo credit card account mentioned earlier. 

No problem yet, the app accepts the payment and then lists my available credit at {$55.00}. This was all on XX/XX/2019. Interest charges had still not been posted and I thought my account would be protected from going over the limit. 

I wake up this morning, check my credit card account and Wells Fargo has slipped in the interest charges in the amount of {$41.00}. This put my card over the limit and it did not consider my {$50.00} payment made on the same day! 

Keep in mind that on my end I did not see these interest charges posted on my account and I thought I was acting in good faith to prevent this situation. This will hurt my credit score. It also affects my minimum payment because since it listed the interest charges as posting BEFORE that {$50.00} payment I made, it is considering my card as if it went over the limit and I had made the payment afterwards. 

But, you can see on my end that the opposite is what I expected to happen. I made a payment BEFORE the interest had posted. My available credit was listed as higher than the interest charge I just received, yet my account is listed as over-the-limit and demanding payment. 

I contacted Wells Fargo and was passed around ( as usual ) between customer service reps who obfuscated and ever turn and were not very nice or helpful. This is not the first time Wells Fargo customer service has seemed to not only not be interested in helping or working with me, they also make me feel like its always my fault. I feel taken advantage of and Im fed up. 

I do not have a lot of money. For me to act in good faith, make a payment before the interest posted and then have the interest duck under that payment puts me in the situation that I was trying to avoid. To make it worse, I have to waste my time ( potential time which I could be earning money to help pay down this credit card ) and literally FIGHT with customer service to even understand where I am coming from and they have crushed my spirit. Please help, I feel powerless to stop them or get them to work with me. Ive tried."
2449,"I believe that WELLS FARGO committed fraud on my Visa XXXX XXXX Account via keeping a bank credited dispute transaction fee on my account for a prolonged period of time thereby falsely inflating my negative credit balance. In other words, this fraudulent practice made me believe that I had more monies on my account than I actually did since WELLS FARGO failed to removed the disputed credited transactions from my account in a timely manner, and made me think that the credited transactions were in fact permanent, when they were in fact temporary. It was not until months later that said WELLS FARGO removed the bank credited temporary balances from my account after I made additional purchases with my WELLS FARGO XXXX XXXX  VISA CARD.

// END OF WELLS FARGO DATA// SUMMARY As one can see, from this date forward, WELLS FARGO should have immediately removed the temporary credit that they issued to me months ago. instead, they kept the credit that they issued me along with the merchants credit to fraudulently inflate my negative credit card balance. After a few months, when I finally made a few purchases, they then removed the temporary credit immediately showing that I in fact owed them, when in fact they should have removed the temporary BANK ISSUED CREDIT months ago prior to my making any purchases which was in fact months later. This practice of over inflating my negative balance is in fact fraud due to the lack of BANKING & CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTABILITY AND REPORTING AS PER 18 U.S. Code 1344."
2453,"My husband and I opened up a Wells Fargo credit card account. we wanted to see how much credit we can get in order to get 0 % interest on a balance transfer from my husbands high interest XXXX  credit card ( card is only in his name ). When we got approved, we were notified that the amount we are approved was {$4000.00}. We decided not to go through with the card. ( no information was given regarding my husbands XXXX credit card. On XX/XX/2019, We were checking our accounts and realized that there was a payment of {$3600.00} made on my husbands XXXX card. We called XXXX and asked if they can tell who made the payment on the account because we didn't make any payments. They were not able to tell, they ended up reversing the payment. As soon the payment was reversed, we noticed a payment of {$3600.00} made on my XXXX credit card that is only in my name. I called XXXX again and they were able to find out who made the payment. I was informed that Wells Fargo did a balance transfer to their credit card without my authorization. Not sure how they were able to get both of our credit card numbers.XXXX is refusing to reverse the payment and Wells Fargo is not requesting to have the payment withdrawn."
2454,"In XXXX or XX/XX/2019, Wells Fargo bank debited my entire personal checking that at the time had an available balance of a little over {$1300.00} in the account to offset a past due credit card payment that I had with their bank. By doing this it caused further extenuating financial hardship for me which led to me filing bankruptcy so that I can keep my home as the available balance at the time was part of my mortgage payment. 

I'm filing a complaint because I'm just recently learning that it was unlawful for Wells Fargo bank to offset an owed credit card payment from a deposit account. I was unable to email the company 's escalation department directly to file my complaint due to my account is now closed with the bank."
2455,"On XX/XX/2017 I went to a merchant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, which does business as "" XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX. '' I told them that a weird noise was coming from my car and I was not sure if it was the transmission or not. They said, okay, we will diagnose it for free. Then called and said there was a lot of damage to the transmission and that I need to fix it immediately ; they gave me a XXXX-XXXX dollar estimate. After they took longer ( 1 full week ) where I had to rideshare, they said my car was finally fixed. I went and picked up my car and the same noise was there. Furthermore, now the car was shifting hard and making other noises that were n't there before. I told them that I had spent XXXX dollars and expected my car to be fixed, why is it still broken? They said they would fix it. I went back a few days later and it turns out the original noise was gone, but now the transmission was making all sorts of noises and heating up. I took it to another shop, XXXX XXXX, and the shop said the transmission on this car was still bad and they gave me a XXXX dollar estimate to fix it. I called back XXXX XXXX, they said the car was fine. I asked my credit card company to do a chargeback because I had not gotten the service I paid for ; instead, my car was worst then it was going in. I had to sell my car for a lot less then I paid for and lost money, furthermore, I had credit card transactions with a business that had defrauded me and messed up my car. I asked my credit card company, Wells Fargo, to help out. I submitted the evidence they requested, which was an invoice or estimate of how much it would cost to repair the car and a statement from a merchant. With all of that, they still charged my card and said there is no way to appeal this. They said there was not enough evidence, even though I gave them what they needed. They said, because the work had not been done, I could not get the chargeback. I was expecting my bank to help me if I am being defrauded and to advocate on my behalf, but they did not ; instead, they have left me in the cold with a credit card bill that I should not have to pay because I did not get the service I paid for and lost a lot of money on a car that was not fixed. I do n't have resources to go to court, that 's why I use a credit card when I can to protect myself from fraudulent business practices ; however, Wells Fargo and XXXX have failed to live unto their promise and are attempting to force me to pay for service that I have already lost a lot of money on and suffered a big loss ( car was worst then before, had a problem it did not before ). If you look at the files, the XXXX XXXX receipt ( doing business as XXXX XXXX ) is dated XX/XX/XXXX. I am given an estimate to do exactly the same service by another shop, with notes saying that XXXX did a bad job, from the XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, which clearly shows what the merchant ( XXXX ) charged me for ( a rebuilt transmission ) was not given to me and the transmission still needed to be replaced as seen by the quote given by XXXX XXXX."
2460,"Hello, I just got letter in the mail from Wells Fargo, its a home projects account, I just got the letter in the mail, I being charged TWICE, not only that that want another {$22.00} for installation fee plus {$76.00} late fee if Im not mistaken, That letter wasnt in the mail maybe a few days ago.normally they charge {$38.00} for a late fee. I admit I was a little late few times, I also paid it, last month I was charged a late fee, however I paid the late fee plus I paid them almost 3x the amount of what my monthly bill is last month just to stay ahead, I guess that didnt work in my favor. Ive been getting harrasing calls from them i keep getting them and I tell them to stop and they dont. Customer service reps werent much of a help. From my understanding they claiming I didnt pay them last month. I did pay them, this is not the first time this happened. Its effecting my credit score. They have suspended my online account, that makes it a little more difficult to pay them. Its stressing me out. They have done a lot people dirty."
2463,I have had a credit card with Wells Fargo since approx XXXX. Sometime in XXXX I was attempting to add an authorized user to the card. I went to remove this secondary individual and was advised by Wells Fargo that I could not do so without closing the card. I never added the person as a secondary card holder - only as an authorized user. I have been contacting Wells Fargo about this issue since XX/XX/XXXX. I was assigned a case manager XXXX and she was suppose to follow up. I haven't heard from her in over a month. I have asked over 15 times to be provided copies of documents that prove that I added the person as a secondary card holder - not just as an authorized user and I have been told on many occasions that the documents will be sent to me. They have never sent me any records. I just recently THIS week received a letter from Wells Fargo advising that they identified that the secondary card holder was not enrolled in the rewards program and they were going to add the person. The other person never made a single transaction on the account. The card/account were solely used by myself. I am taking full responsibility for the balance and Wells Fargo refuses to remove the other person despite not showing me any proof that they should continue to exist on the account in the first place. I contacted Wells Fargo through XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. They called me today and the person that called said they would need to get the credit card executive team on the line and to please hold for 1-2 mins. I stayed on hold for over 20 mins before hanging up in frustration. This is not the first issue I have had with Wells Fargo yet I continue to try to give them the benefit. I am done trying. I have no reason to believe that they didn't add the person as a secondary fraudulently to boost their sales numbers as I know they have received previous allegations of.
2467,"Im writing to you because I noticed that my most recent credit report contains a closed account reported recently for my Wells Fargo account. I want you to know that I understand, and have great respect for my financial obligations.

Unfortunately, at the time of the incident mentioned above, I was in college and had no idea how to manage credit responsibly. I have completely paid off my debt and aside from this one time unavoidable circumstance, you will see that I have an excellent payment record. In the near future, I am planning on applying for credit, and it has come to my attention that the closed account on my credit reports could hurt my ability to qualify.

I am humbly asking for you to remove this account. I would greatly appreciate it!"
2468,"In early to mid XXXX I called Wells Fargo to see if there were any available promotions able to be applied to my account. I was given 0 % interest on purchases for 6 months, and 0 % interest on balance transfers for 15 months with a 4 % of the total balance transfer fee upon transfer. I accepted the promotions to be applied to my account. A few days later I called WF again to set up the balance transfer, but before instigating the balance transfer I verbally confirmed with the representative 3 to 4 times that if I made an approximately {$500.00} purchase, and a {$4000.00} balance transfer, and then paid $ XXXX monthly, that the 6 month 0 % interest balance would be paid off before the 6 month promotion expired and I would subsequently be charged interest. The representative verbally confirmed that the 6 month balance would be paid off, multiple times, which I took to be a verbal contract between me and Wells Fargo Bank. I initiated the balance transfer of {$4000.00}, and was charged the 4 % fee of {$160.00}. I also made a {$490.00} purchase. These charges posted to my account XX/XX/XXXX. These two separate promotional balances were shown on my XX/XX/XXXX statement. I then made a {$400.00} payment which applied on XX/XX/XXXX. Upon reviewing my XX/XX/XXXX statement, I found that the 6 month promotional balance had been reduced by {$26.00} to {$470.00} and the 15 month promotional balance had been reduced by {$370.00} to {$3700.00}. 6.645 % of my {$400.00} payment was applied to my 6 month promotional balance, and 93.355 % of my {$400.00} payment was applied to my 15 month promotional balance. At this rate if I continue to make {$400.00} payments monthly I will not pay off the 6 month promotional balance before the promotion is over, and I will be charged interest. I called Wells Fargo today, XX/XX/XXXXand was escalated to a supervisor and then to XXXX at the Executive Office of Customer Care. I explained my situation to him and informed him that I felt that Wells Fargo was breaching a verbal contract made with me. XXXX informed me that there was nothing he could do, and that if I continued to make the $ XXXX monthly payments I would not pay off the balance and would be charged interest. I asked XXXX to provide me with an explanation of how Wells Fargo applies payments to different promotional balances on the same account, and he either could not or would not provide me with that information. In conclusion, I feel that Wells Fargo Bank is in breach of a verbal contract because I was assured that my 6 month promotional balance would be successfully paid off if I made {$400.00} payments per month, and now that I have reviewed my statement after making a {$400.00} payment I see that I will not be able to pay off the 6 month promotional balance in time to avoid being charged interest."

2473,I have a cash card with Wells Fargo Financial. My problem is that the website only allows payments up to {$5000.00} per day. This restriction causes additional interest charges on the amount over {$5000.00} ( in my case at an interest rate of 24.9 % ). This is an unnecessary requirement and I would guess it is solely for the purpose of collecting additional interest.

They told me that because I had no open trade lines that I would need to place a deposit on the card and that after 12 months of payments my money would be returned to me. And I would have a graduated credit card. This hasnt happened in 4 years, they say because I was a few days later here and there over 4 years is why my account hasnt been upgraded. Because they have been fee harvesting me for hundreds and hundreds of dollars. And refuse to upgrade my card. Other lenders see this card and dont want to extend me credit. This card reporting as secured is damaging my credit profile. And my ability to get housing and low rates on transportation and vehicle loans. 

According to the fair consumer credit act payments up to 30 days may not be used to my detriment. Only payments 30 days and over are recognized under this statute. However Wells Fargo uses this as legitimate reason to damage my credit profile.

2480,"I received a phone call from the company XXXX about making my credit card payment. I stated that I would be going online to make the payment when I hung up, which I followed through. On the payment site I made selections for the {$40.00} plus dollars which was the XXXX due and on the card. Followed the steps to the next page and something must have gone wrong as the payment did not go through. I at the time thought it was complete. It was not until I noticed a significant drop in my credit score,  called XXXX to understand the issue and ensure I had not been a victim of identify theft, that I found out my score significantly dropped due to an unpaid bill of {$70.00} plus dollars ( {$40.00} plus the late fee ) for this XXXX account. I have had this account since XX/XX/2012. A credit limit of {$1000.00}. I most always make the full payments prior to the month of the purchase because I only use the card for the points. I have never missed a payment. And this was reflected on my score of an XXXX that dropped to XXXX because of a {$40.00} bill and a {$35.00} late fee from XXXX. This is ridiculous to allow a company to have the right to claim this type of penalty."
2482,"On XXXX XXXX, I received a XXXX  XXXX that I never applied for. I called Wells Fargo, the issuing company. My phone number was recognized for the account, and the account already had a balance of {$4500.00}. I was connected with XXXX in the Fraud Department. XXXX marked the charges as fraudulent and closed the account. I've also contacted XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX to freeze my credit report, investigate this fraud, and correct my credit report. 

There was also an attempt to open an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have my home and car insurance with XXXX, but have no other products. I informed XXXX and the 3 credit bureaus of this attempt."
2486,"I made a credit card payment on Wells Fargo and it went through as expected. The problem is when I look at the ACH transfer on my bank statement I see that Wells Fargo has 9 digits of my credit card number in the XXXX description. Looking back through my bank statements, I see that this pattern is repeated for every payment I've made over the years."
2489,"I opened a secure credit card with Wells Fargo over 5 years ago and was told I would receive my {$300.00} back in 1 year as long as I maintained my account, which I have done. My fiancee opened an account the same time and her card was transferred to unsecured in 6 months. Now 5 or more years later, maintaining on time payments, they are still holding my money with no reason as to why. I have contacted several times with no reason as to why."
2494,"I misplaced my Wells Fargo debit card. On XX/XX/2022 Wells Fargo refused to promptly issue a temporary debit card. Wells Fargo verbally stated that it will be 2-3 weeks from XX/XX/XXXX before I receive my replacement debit card in the mail. This means 2-3 weeks of being unable to make online purchases that I planned to make last week. This means 2-3 weeks of waiting in line for assistance from a teller when I withdraw cash from my checking account. This means 2-3 weeks of being unable to withdraw cash on Sundays or holidays. 

I have filed complaints with the XXXX XXXX XXXX and the Federal Reserve. My XXXX  complaint number is XXXX. XXXX XXXX response to the XXXX  was dismissive of the problem. The Federal Reserve has not provided me with a case number."

On XX/XX/XXXX and after calling several times on XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo bank said there is no way they can help me with a dispute because the transaction was done with XXXX and they don't have any dispute rights and to call XXXX. 

I called XXXX and they said is incorrect, this is their response : "" I fear Wells Fargo is mistaken : If the funds were taken from your bank account, you have the ability to dispute those charges with your bank. If you file a dispute with your card-issuing bank, XXXX will work with them as they decide the dispute. Disputing a charge on your statement is within your right as a cardholder. '' "" I am really sorry for the experience you are having with your bank. They can and should be willing to help you begin the Dispute process. '' "" At this point, XXXX will work with your bank to resolve the dispute. "" I again called the bank, i have done that several times and explained to them that they are violating my rights and they just dont care, they said they dont have dispute rights.

2502,"Hello, On XX/XX/XXXX I had made a call to my Wells Fargo bank for a promotion they had for 14 or 14 months 0 % apr. I had wanted to transfer for personal loan to the 0 % apr offer they had. This is a continuance to claim # XXXX. The dispute was that the had done a hard pull on my credit-report when they said it was a soft pull only. WellsFargo disputed all a ligations. I had spoken with two bank representatives, one early in the morning and second one sometime later in the day when I finished homework with my nieces. I believe the second representative pulled my credit report and the reason I believe that is because I had my Credit Frozen and I did unfreeze it later that day. 

I accepted the fact that I have a hard inquiry but there had been a XXXX increase that I was unaware of. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  I received a voicemail from the management department at wellsfargo, Miss XXXX a phone call I had missed due to the school conference for the kids. ( Screenshot of voicemail will be included ) I did call back after hours and spoke with someone in the XXXX and the banker was not aware of what that voicemail was all about. 

I contacted my XXXX phone carrier to show proof that I did call back. The DISPUTE IS THAT I WAS NOT AWARE OF A COUNTEROFFER FOR A TOTAL OF XXXX made on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX she stated the call was recorded so there is proof of our conversation ) Miss XXXX, the account specialist at ex : XXXX Advised me of the counter offer and asked me if I would accept it and I said Yes, might as well since I have a hard inquiry. I was advised of this offer on XX/XX/XXXX. No one in the corporate office had any idea of who made the call on XX/XX/XXXX and what that was about. The XXXX offer was accepted by me and Miss XXXX stated that she will reach out to the underwriters to make sure the XXXX increase will reflect on my account in the next 36-48 hours. I know believe that the phone call from the management department made on XX/XX/XXXX was for the counter offer but no one told me. 

Miss XXXX at ex : XXXX reached back out and left me a message on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX  Which I had missed due to being at work already. I had called her back and she Stated that one of the underwriters need to read me the discloses before I accept the counter offer. She then transfer me to a underwriter that informed me that I only got approved for XXXX total because there was 7 days in which I had to respond. I WAS NEVER AWARE OF A COUNTER OFFER OF ANY KIND TILL 27 days later!! NO ONE HAS MENTION A 7 DAY WINDOW VIA TELEPHONE OR IN WRITING, considering that I spoke with miss XXXX from the corporate office and other representative at least 7-10 times I DECLINED THE XXXX offer for Wells Fargo was not transparent with me. They gave me their word and then they took it back because it was convenient for them. 

On XX/XX/XXXX Miss XXXX expressed her apologies that there was nothing she could do even though I EXPRESSED MY FRUSTRATION ON NOT KNOWING THERE WAS A COUNTER OFFER OR A TIME FRAME after she asked me if I would accept the counter offer. Until this day I never received. A letter or a phone call from anyone regarding the counter offer or time frame.

I called again on XX/XX/XXXX checking where my check is. I was told it would take 7-14 business days. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by rep XXXX that I'll give it until XX/XX/XXXX, and call back on the XXXX if I didn't receive the check by the XXXX. I requested for the check to get replaced but XXXX was not willing to replace it. I called again XX/XX/XXXX, spoke with XXXX, still no check and was told to wait until XX/XX/XXXX. This has been going for over a month and it makes me wonder if a check was really sent. It is hard to trust Wells Fargo since this company has a tarnished reputation and a repeat offender."
2509,"XX/XX/XXXX my Wells Fargo checking account was hacked and somebody paid XXXX dollars bill to another bank. The problem is that On my checking account I just had XXXX dollars and WF allowed overdraft from my Wells Fargo credit card that was XXXX dollars. I went to a bank branch and opened a claim ( XXXX ).

I have filed three claims with Wells Fargo to date, provided them with a police report from the XXXX Precinct in XXXX confirming that their investigation proved that my XXXX, XXXX  XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo accounts were all hacked to the total amount of {$25000.00}. 

Wells Fargo has denied my claims, XXXX is giving me a hard time about some charges and XXXX XXXX XXXX has two other charges they need to clear. 

I would very much appreciate the help reversing all these issues, Wells Fargo is the most pressing and the one I need help with the most. 

This is all due to my being scammed by someone who offered to assist me with paying my bills due to financial hardship, who asked for my login info, and then turned out to be a scammer/hacker and committed so much fraud, leaving me in worse financial shape."
2514,"I would like assistance disputing several transactions on my account. I did not realize that I could do this and after filing a complaint with the Attorney General I have been advised that my recourse is to go through my bank. I have contacted XXXX  XXXX and been refunded in full but Wells Fargo on teh other hand does not seem to be as helpful so I am turning to you for assistance since I get nowhere when calling. To make a long story short, last year after watching a video on my XXXX feed about a guy who had quit his job because of this program. After speaking to the people I was assured this as a no-risk program and not to worry they will help every step of the way The first payment to XXXX  XXXX  XXXX, XXXX showed on my statement as XXXX  *XXXX  for XX/XX/19 {$590.00}. They also go by the aliases XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX  XXXX, XXXX. Under these aliases on XX/XX/19, I paid {$12000.00} from my Wells Fargo checking account check # XXXX. While I begin sourcing items through XXXX XXXX told I need to have services from XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$8000.00} on XX/XX/19 and then was contacted by a company named XXXX asking for {$4000.00} for tax services they reduced this fee to {$350.00} and never did anything for this payment. Then comes XXXX XXXX  XXXX  who I have already filed an Attorney General Complaint for they were to handle the business end of things and marketing over a weeks time from XXXX I am charged various charges totaling {$9800.00}. Then XXXX XXXX? Charges me {$20.00} and finally, as the company named XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/19 charges me {$2200.00} and another {$2000.00} that was supposed to be for a video and teaching or helping me use Social Media. I am sickened on how things snowballed from a desire to earn an income from home to basically being swindled out of {$35000.00}. These companies completely took advantage of me, they led me to believe I would be making all kinds of money with little effort. Nothing could be further from the truth this seems more like a well-concocted scheme that is meant for failure and I have ever since discover that there is a government injunction on one of the companies. I am pleading to you for assistance in having Wells Fargo help me with at minimum the transactions that were on my card ending in XXXX."

Just want it transferred over. When I pay them I transfer from the linked account. I think Wells Fargo just wants to hold the money interest free.
2518,I recieved the email below from wells fargo on XX/XX/2019. I followed up with their teams for the last 3 days asking what the at risk event was. They have refused to disclose it. They went as far to tell me to call visa. Visa informed me that Wells Fargo has the information. I attempted to speak to a manager today. After 2 hours of wating they hung up. If there was a potential privacy breach I have a right to know the nature and details of that breach We have shipped your new Wells Fargo Debit Card ending in XXXX-XXXX-XXXX- We sent you a replacement card as a precautionary measure because your current Wells Fargo Debit Card may be at risk for unauthorized transactions.

It has now since been 99 days, well past the 60-days Wells Fargo 's policies dictate to resolve these disputes and past the 90-days the Fair Credit Billing Act allows for the creditor ( Wells Fargo ) to resolve said dispute.

I have attempted multiple levels of escalation with Wells Fargo call centers, social media support team and executive customer service, all efforts have failed to remedy the issue."

2532,"Sometime in XX/XX/XXXX, a friend had gutters put on his house and was happy with the product. He asked if XXXX XXXX if he would like to speak to the company. XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX. XXXX XXXX agrees to a showing. 

The appointment was with XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Ga XXXX Phone ( XXXX ) XXXX Fax ( XXXX ) XXXX, XXXX, was on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX measures the house on a very brutal XX/XX/XXXX, day. asked if XXXX XXXX was going to assist, he replied no, and came the house. XXXX was out measuring for forty-five minutes. When she ran in, she needed a minute to warm up. 

The whole conversation about the entire contract between the XXXX XXXX was verbal. No paperwork left with XXXX XXXX about the work to be done. Only a simple credit application with approval, already maxed out by the contract price and signed by XXXX XXXX. When XXXX XXXX realized, all XXXX left him with was a credit card sign application and an illegible and incomplete cancellation form. The following day we requested such forms billing of the job, complete information for the cancellation notice, and what specific discounts did we get with our package deal. We explained we had just saw a commercial claiming discounts. We wanted to see a billing for the work to be done and the discounts spelled out. We will refer you to the first few attachment for better clarity at this point. 

Part two : XXXX XXXX sent a representative XXXX XXXX. top sales rep. to speak about the issues. He was unprepared to answer the questions about the difference in billing and statements. But he tried. He understood the problems with how the drainage system was over worked in some areas causing flooding of the back enclosed porch and under worked in other areas. Apologized for the language barriers with the installer who did not speak XXXX, and therefore could not make the adjustments as XXXX represented in the walk around the house. We were less than impressed about why he too is unable to give me figures on the billing. therefore Wells Fargo gives them an amount they will finance and they bill according to the financing available. nothing to do with materials and labor. 

We are dissappointed to report that Wells Fargo is aware of bad business practices of one of their loan program contractors they do business with. Our compliant with WellsFargo Bank, is that the job is priced according to the amount Wells is willing to loan. Our complaint number for that company is XXXX against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). To date Wells Fargo is aware of the Company 's  inability to give a true billing of charges and are not according to TV commerial. Wells Fargo is also aware we have damages due to this installation of product. And are still wating for the corrections to take place. We also feel that the job is over priced due the excessive use of downspouts. 
With all our dissatisfaction, Wells Fargo has, returned to activating the card for regualr payments. 
We are waiting for full resolution to the above listed issues are resolved to return to payment status. This event took place on XX/XX/XXXX."

I submitted the cancellation information provided to me by the vendor and the written emails which were sent on XX/XX/XXXX to cancel the contracts. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received two notices ( one for each charge ) from Wells Fargo stating that they had declined to dispute the transaction because the merchant had no record of our cancellation and that they had no authority to cancel our contracts. The vendor replied to Wells Fargo that we inquired about cancelling the contract but that we failed to actually do so and they sent the contract which shows that written communication, which can be accepted by email, is needed to terminate the contracts and within 30 days the contract will terminate. I provided Wells Fargo with a copy of the vendor 's cancellation policy and the written notice we submitted to the vendor on XX/XX/XXXX. The vendor is using a malicious and deceitful tactics to prey upon their clients and Wells Fargo is not doing their due diligence to protect me and other consumers from malicious companies as they have ignored all written evidence provided to them. The vendor will not cooperate with us over the phone or through written communications and now Wells Fargo is allowing this unethical business practice to proceed."

I again advised them that I had not received it. Their next message on XX/XX/XXXX stated : "" Our records show that the check was mailed to you on XX/XX/XXXX. Before I can place a stop payment on the requested check, I am required to have an affidavit form and cover letter completed and returned to us.You will shortly be receiving in the mail the documents required to submit a stop payment on check number XXXX in the amount of {$25.00}. I never received these documents, so I again contacted Wells Fargo.On XX/XX/XXXX I wrote the following : "" It has been 2 1/2 weeks and I still have not received the documents. How am I to get these documents? Can these be picked up and signed for at a branch? This really shouldn't be that hard. I should not have to keep logging into an account that I closed some time ago. '' Now, Wells Fargo response is that I need to go through the Non-Fraud Claims."
2549,"I called Wells Fargo to close a credit card last fall. I used to have a checking account with them and would periodically sign into my account but have since closed that. I only just discovered through a credit reporting agency, however, that the card was still open and that I was assessed an annual fee in XXXX and then late fees every month thereafter until XXXX. I have not used the card in years, and thought it was closed. I just called to ask if the card had been closed, and in any case if I could be refunded the annual fee and the late fees. I was given a roundabout answer and transferred to a few offices, and none of the representatives I spoke with could clarify what the process for "" investigating '' the card 's status would be."
2550,"I am a 6 year credit card customer with XXXX XXXX and also a former employee 10 years ago. I was recently in the hospital for a big XXXX and the Bank closed my card because I missed payment during that time. My payment history with them is literally perfect and have a 99 %. I also hold my primary account with them and had over {$4000.00} currently in that account, so they could have debit that account easily. As a result of this they closed my account and I am told they cant reopen it."
2551,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Wells Fargo in response to my complaint about their unfair practice of payment allocations of credit card 's promotional balances. 
I have two zero-interest promotional balance offers with Wells Fargo. One promotional balance transfer will expire on XX/XX/XXXX. The second zero interest promotional balance transfer will expire on XX/XX/XXXX. When I make payments, a larger percentage portion of the is applied to second promotional balance transfer balance. Making it possible for Wells Fargo to apply interest to the first promotional balance transfer that expires sooner. My payments are allocation unfairly ; 70 % to 90 % of my payment is applied to the second promotional balance and only 30 % to 10 % is applied the promotional balance that will expire sooner. I wrote a letter to Wells Fargo, a credit card billing Manager acknowledge my complaint and concerns but my payments are still being allocated unfairly."
2552,"I paid off the balance on my Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX card on the last day of the billing cycle. They did not post the payment promptly, and told me it could take up to 3 days to post to my account. As a result of not posting my payment in a timely manner, they reported an incorrect balance to the credit reporting agencies. I asked them if they could do a forced, off-cycle update to the credit bureaus to accurately show my account information, and they denied my request. All of my other credit cards, ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) post payments the night of the payment. I am working on financing to buy a home and wanted my credit report to accurate reflect my account balance."
2553,"To Whom It May Concern : I have a credit card with Wells Fargo that I opened over 7 years ago as a college XXXX. I seldomly use this card and pay it off right away. This has been the case for every month since the inception of this card. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I opted to use this card to make an online purchase on the website XXXX After searching around for a particular pair of sneakers I came across this site and purchased 2 classic pairs of XXXX XXXX XXXX sneakers. These were meant to be a gift to a collector friend of mine whom lost a few family members due to XXXX. This purchase totalled approximately {$1500.00} and with expedited shipping it was approximately {$1700.00}. 

Weeks went by and the item had not been delivered. I was going to wait for the expected ship date before calling the company. To my surprise approximately one month later on XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo emailed me and texted me that suspicious activities were taken place on my card. A {$250.00} charge from XXXX was declined. A charge I did not authorize, approve or solicit. 

I called Wells Fargo as I was instructed to do so and mentioned to them that i did not make this purchase and also that my original purchase was never delivered and I was a victim of undelivered goods from the website XXXX. 

I was assured this was not an issue, they would file a dispute and mail me a new card. I immediately logged in to my account but could not see my card listed, I assumed this was because it was being reset. 

On XX/XX/XXXX a {$1800.00} charge appeared on my account and a few days later XX/XX/XXXX a {$3400.00} charge appeared on my account. I was made aware of this by the wells fargo fraud department. 

They called me and asked if I was in the possession of my card. I confirmed that I was ( I had not received a new one ) and they proceeded to tell me that suspicious charges were coming up on my card. They described the charges {$1800.00} and {$3400.00} and said they were from XXXX. I mentioned to them I did not make these purchases and that they were fraudulent charges. 

They said they must have continued to schedule charges on this account and that they would chargeback the activity and send a new card immediately. 

Within days the new card arrived, my balance seemed to have been fixed but to my surprise within 24 hours of activating my new card the two fraud charges were once again billed to my card. {$1800.00} and {$3400.00} a total of {$5300.00}. I was in shock given that the limit on this card is {$5000.00}. I immediately called wells fargo and I was told my fraud claims were denied because I was in possession of my card and had done business with this merchant before. 

Now I am a victim of fraud charges that exceeded the limit of card. I have been working to defend my case with Wells Fargo and have been spending hours trying to communicate with a dubious XXXX merchant with no listed phone number who will not return my emails and I have been applying for "" claim reconsideration '' with wells fargo. 

I am losing sleep, and stressing. A very intentional purchase led me to be scammed, not receiving any goods and having thousands of dollars charged to my account. 

The bank is asking me to reach out to the merchant ( which I have and have had no answers ), they have denied my claim and asked me to apply for reconsideration of claims. I worry this maxed out credit card will effect my ability to purchase a home and I am being mistreated as if though i am the criminal from my own bank. 

PLEASE HELP ME."
2555,XXXX if 2017 I closed account that was a secure card. When I got my final statement it showed I owed money to them. I looked at statement that they printed up to me at the bank and noticed the 1st thing. It was a {$30.00} dollar difference in amounts from the ending month to the very 1st day if the new moth showing on the opening balance. I have been unable to work on this due to heath issues with major XXXX. Also I have a unauthorized charge from a hotel in XXXX XXXX that we never stayed at it was canceled and the charges it 2 weeks after we were supposed to stay ther that was never removed. I did call the bank before the charge took place and told them not to except the charge and the did anywAys. This put me over a lot and the accounting they re doing it deliberate. They know the amonts were not right and thats not legal. They will Just say sorry about the mistake and nothing to come out of it. I bet if you looked over my account and did a re accounting of it theres a lot of things! Im just not able to do in my condition. Now its on my credit report and they refuse to remove it or give me back my money they took or gave. their stealing from all of us. And I dont need this aggravation right now above all things. Can you help Me solve this?
2560,"I have been in USA two times as XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX   ). My first trip was from XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX. During the first trip, I opened XXXX  XXXX XXXX checking account and close it right before I left a country in XXXX XXXX.The second trip was from XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX. During the second trip I opened a Wells Fargo checking account and close it right before I left a country at XXXX XXXX.From XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX I lived in XXXX. When I came into the USA at XX/XX/XXXX I went to Wells Fargo bank to renew/reopen my checking account. The banking clerk told me that she cant open for me regular account because of my bad credit history, she opened for my opportunity ( limited ) checking account and suggest to check all my information within a credit bureaus. I was shocked because I haver never apply for any credit lines/loans/credit cards in Unites States till XX/XX/XXXX. After a few months I found out information about credit reports/score/credit history. I login to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX  and XXXX XXXX to check information under my SSN and find out numerous accounts under my name which was opened when I even didnt had a visa to USA. Those accounts were opened within XXXX years when I lived in XXXX and dont even think about USA. So, this complain is about WFFNATBANK account which was open ( according to credit report ) XX/XX/XXXX with a credit limit XXXX $ and current balance XXXX $ .I have never apply for WFFNATBAN credit card/never received. credit cards.

2562,"I had fraudulent charges on my Wells Fargo account via a debit card. After hours of calling, I was put on the phone with a supervisor, they said that the person who used my card called into Wells Fargo, was not asked security questions, and changed my personal information online. 

Now, a month later, the exact same thing happened again. WF keeps allowing fraudulent agents to access my account via their phone system without proper security. They have obtained my SSN and DOB now as a result."
2563,"After receiving an offer for a XXXX  % balance transfer from Wells Fargo, through the mail, I requested same online for the amount of {$7300.00} ( the balance of a XXXX XXXX that I owned ending in XXXX ). Subsequently, I received, through the mail, on XX/XX/XXXX an approval for exactly {$6000.00} from WF ( an amount insufficient to satisfy the aforementioned balance. ) Recognizing this, I then took advantage of a similar offer presented by XXXX XXXX XXXX, which provided a credit limit of {$9000.00}, ( received via U.S.Mail, on the same day ). After committing, via phone, with XXXX, I, as a courtesy, contacted WF in order to determine their process for declining the offer for the lesser amount. On that same day, XXXX @ XXXX, I spoke with the first WF representative "" XXXX XXXX who advised that she did not know what to do and transferred me over to XXXX ( pronounced XXXX ) who proceeded to let me know that the transfer was pending ( initiated that day ) and he could do nothing to stop it. I insisted that the process be halted because I had accepted the offer from XXXX. XXXX continued to persist with the claim that "" he could not stop the initiated process '' but advised that he could transfer me over to his escalation/customer advocacy group ; within this group I spoke/w "" XXXX XXXX '' who immediately informed me that the process was laid out in my terms and conditions. I read through same while on the line w/XXXX and this provision was not listed. She then said that someone would send them ( the terms reflecting the initiation of the balance transfer ) to me, nonetheless, despite the fact that I had not authorized the transfer, and the credit limit being less than the balance transfer requested, WF had processed the balance transfer. When I submitted to her that this was a predatory act with the sole purpose of enacting a fee, she said that she would have her XXXX XXXX group reach out to me and gave me a case # ending in XXXX. After several days, I received an email from Case Specialist "" XXXX XXXX '' Having attempted to contact her directly for several days, I finally was able to converse with her on XXXX. We had a contentious conversation through which she let me know that WF would evaluate the situation and have a response in 11 days and the verdict would be final regardless of the outcome. Overall, my complaint is that I did not authorize the balance transfer. My reasonable expectation was that I would need to speak to someone and detail my options, especially since the credit limit offered was less ( by more than {$1000.00} ) than the requested transfer amount. Also, based on the consequences that WF suffered after being convicted of fraudulent behaviors in the early XXXX 's [ XXXX  : XXXX ], I believed that they would be far less apt to present themselves in this deceitful manner. I have suffered emotionally, and possibly financially from this process... please assist. I will happily return the amount of the transfer ( being that I recognize that it was applied when I checked the XXXX XXXX account on XXXX ). I spoke/w with a rep from my XXXX company who said that I could request a check for the credit and return it to Wells Fargo XXXX I am disgusted by their tactics and it is not difficult to see that the only reason for them to have acted in this was is to garner the fee, assuming my unwillingness to complain to ALL of the protection agencies available. This is a predatory act that is not remedied through the simple return of the funds because they will require that a fee be paid to them for the transfer. Please note that I had gone trough every available channel to resolve this matter in good faith."
2566,"I have submitted multiple complaints in regards to a credit card scam I was victim of. I have requested to have someone reach out to me via phone each time. I have yet to receive a phone call about it. When I offered to settle ( this has been impacting my credit while trying to resolve legally ) I was ran through and idc calculator. The collections agent persuaded me to answer one of the questions differently than what I had originally answered. This caused me to be denied a settlement. I have said I am willing to pay everything, including the XXXX fraudulent double charge. The only thing I am asking to settle on is the interest accrued while trying to resolve this. The collections agent told me if I don't pay the whole thing they will just sell the debt to a collections agency and just write off the lost money in their taxes. This is ridiculous and an example of irresponsible lending from Wells yet again. Wells Fargo is a parasite to American society."
2567,I was notified that a credit card account was opened under my name. I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and was told they would do an investigation. Over a month has gone by and my credit report is still reporting an open account from an address I do not recognize. Wells Fargo has sent me a regular card statement but has not contacted me to give me an update and has not told me whether the card is closed. I am concerned this is on my credit reports and that it may be used for fraudulent purposes
2574,"I closed my business ( XXXX XXXX ) bank and credit card account ( with Wells Fargo ) in XXXX 2016,  but recently I received an unsolicited XXXX XXXX credit card. I did not activate it and a few weeks ago I received a letter from Wells Fargo complaining I did not activate the credit card that I did not solicit for an account I closed in 2016!"
2577,Im writing to contest my wells fargo card service account that i closed in XX/XX/XXXX. I did debt consolidation and paid a company that closed the account and made payments for me. I received multiple late payments in XX/XX/XXXX even the the account was closed XX/XX/XXXX. I made all my payments to the 3rd party debt consolidation company. I dont know why i have all these late payments.
2578,"WELLS FARGO HEALTH ADVANTAGE CREDIT CARD On XX/XX/XXXX at approx. XXXX XXXX EST I made a call to pay my bill via phone as I do every month. While on the call there appeared to be numerous stops or delays in the prompts. I gave verbal orders for a payment of {$100.00}, it did not go through. I entered {$100.00}, it did not go through. At this time the prompts were asking to confirm a payment of {$780.00}. I verbalized NO, STOP, Cancel. Thinking this would cancel and I could start over the process them moved to confirmation. Again I said NO, STOP, CANCEL. I should have hung up but the prompt moved into confirming I payed {$780.00}. I DID NOT! That was my whole paycheck. 
I called Wells Fargo Health Advantage at shortly after XXXX XXXX EST. Spoke to a representative who had me on hold shortly and returned citing they can not stop the payment. WHY? The response was "" We can't do that anymore ''. I told the representative that it states it's a recorded line and I did not give authorization to my bank account for {$780.00}. I wanted to pay {$100.00} only. At that time I was told that Wells Fargo will attempt to access my account 3 X. I had to withdraw my money from my bank account so they wouldn't take my whole check. Thus causing overdrafts for funds that were already coming out legitimately. The first hit occurred on XX/XX/XXXX for an amount of - {$32.00} overdraft for Wells Fargo. There was a second attempt to to withdraw from my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX. Why is this okay? I never authorized the first attempt, now 9 days later they are trying again. Resulting in another {$32.00} overdraft. Now I'm just talking about what my bank charged. Wells Fargo felt obliged to help themselves to more charges on their end. I called a second time at this point and spoke with a representative named XXXX. XXXX was not so helpful. At this time I had received another bill stating that I had a balance of {$850.00} and only owed {$27.00}. The representative states that there was a payment of {$850.00}. That may have been possible because the XXXX  office sends back any payments that were not used at the end of treatment. I told the representative the situation and she said they will send out a form for me to fill out for the return of the money I paid since I was only trying to pay {$100.00} but it would take several weeks. I didn't pay them anything from that transaction of XX/XX/XXXX. I pay ahead so there was no money due at the time. Now it's time to pay the bill but nobody can tell me what to pay. Then I got hit a 3rd time on XX/XX/XXXX for another {$32.00} attempt to access my bank account for {$780.00}. WHAT?? This can't be legal! It most certainly is scandalous and corrupt. So today I will make another attempt to work with these people but I'm not sure where it will lead. At any rate this needs to be reported.

2579,"Wells Fargo pressured me into opening a business savings account and then lied that it was a requirement that they also sign me up for a business credit card at the same time. Years later I finally closed said business account, that was two and a half years ago! I get at least one card offer a week from them and they tracked me accross state lines to a state they don't even have a branch in. This week was the final straw, they sent me a business credit card for the account and business that I closed down two and a half years ago."

2587,"Following up on my complaint XXXX Well Fargo Bank sent me a confirmation letter of the CFPB complaint on XX/XX/2019, to my residential address & a letter, dated XX/XX/2019, CONFIRMING the original complaint details. Nothing is in dispute : the facts I put forth are true and correct. 

By confirming that Wells Fargos own Branch was incapable of recording, copying, duplicating my address verification and government identification documents despite THREE SEPARATE  VISITS to the same Wells Fargo branch is not in dispute. It is the reason I have made the request to withdraw the application and destroy the physically-submitted documents. 

Despite my request to withdraw the application and destroy the documents, Wells Fargo engages in an absurd game over whose information they have in their possession. Its again unacceptable. The market has alternatives and my information should not be held given the egregious treatment of said information. 

If its identifiable to ME, Ive requested it be withdrawn. If they can not get their own Wells Fargo employees to make proper copies, all the more reason to not trust them or their process. 

Last, the letter from the Executive Office is signed by a XXXX XXXX? Is XXXX a legitimate last name? To put it politely, use your full name when trying to fix a problem of your own companys failed, defective process. Dont hide behind failure : own it, XXXX XXXX"

2597,I tried to revoke the authority of a merchant to charge my credit card. After weeks of trying the merchant will not return my calls. As such I called my credit card ( Wells Fargo ) to tell them to revoke the authorization of the merchant to charge my card. Wells Fargo refused to comply and stated that the merchant can charge what they want even without my authorization.

After enrolling online, on XX/XX/2019, I made a purchase with XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. 

Since then, Wells Fargo has refused to honor the terms and conditions of the promotion stating I never enrolled in the promotion. This is blatantly false and an attempt to not honor the promotion."
2601,"3 years ago Wells Fargo rep recommended to open a secure business credit card to bring up my credit scores, sold as credit repair. Wells Fargo used my {$1000.00}, what was converted to a standard credit card a year and a half later. The problem is just find it out, the business credit is not getting any credit ratings/scores at all. So it is not effecting my credit worthiness.3 years of use of the card for nothing.Finally I picked up on it, something is really wrong because my credit score was barely rising per year, using the card with $ XXXX/month auto pay, a lot more then the {$25.00} minimum payment would have been.Interestingly you can change everything on the WF website, after you log in in the manage accounts, like do transfers between accounts, but to change the amount of the MINIMUM monthly payment is not possible. Actually only Wells Fargo Rep can  change that for us, after you call them on the phone line! You can not adjust your own payments to a higher number, if you liked to! Regardless how the business card is on my name, beyond the name of the business, is used with my social security numbers, you wont get any credit points/ratings for the use of the card.This product is a fraud.First they used my own money for 18 months, and now XXXX   rep said they don't rate credit for business credit cards period.Only the personal accounts getting scored.I asked WF rep on the phone who rates it, and he had no answer for me. Well no one is the right answer.So why Wells Fargo selling the idea first place for the credit repair? It is not repairing a thing.They have secured and other person cash for 18 months for free use .Just like a new saving account for them.They play the market with with my founds for their own benefit. Why not the in house rep advised me correctly to get a personal line of credit card for the promised credit repair? Everyone blames everyone. We to costumers are getting taken for a ride with offer of a fraudulent product/service. If I close this card now it will effect my scores. We are screwed both ways on this deal."
2602,"Account number ending in : XXXX Wells Fargo case number : XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, case number : XXXX Your response is nothing but a simple dodge. 
The recent credit report provided, has history before XX/XX/XXXX. So, saying the provided credit report is to recent is nothing more than ploy. I wonder what ridiculous excuse you'll come up with next to avoid correcting your mistake. So therefore, I request you ask your Underwriter the exact documentation needed for me to overturn this. So, you and XXXX XXXX XXXX, can stop wasting time. Let me remind you it was your Boss who said Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Credit Card Services will consider overturning this if I can prove nothing adverse was being reported around the time you did your review. Even though, I have already done that. Attached is a credit report dated XX/XX/XXXX. It's closer to the date you did your review and it also has history prior to the date you did your review, needless to say still pointless. However, you'll find that all adverse accounts are closed and that all closed adverse accounts are dated closed in XXXX ; and nothing adverse reported leading up to or in the month of your stated XX/XX/XXXX review. So again you'll find that nothing adverse was reported in order for you to reduce my credit line. So clearly something else is going on. 
Moreover, you failed to answers my questions in the last CFPB complaint. So I will itemize those questions so you can focus on what needs to be addressed : 1. Where is the adverse information on my credit report that lead you to your decision?

2. How did I pass all other previous reviews? 
My whole argument is, you have/there is no "" information previously reviewed, '' in XX/XX/XXXX. I have proven this doesn't exists. Sadly Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. is protecting the real reason for their decision to reduce my credit line. By saying its proprietary information. Question? How am I suppose to correct or refute the information you say you have if you won't share the information. Furthermore, I have proven that there was no adverse action prior to your XX/XX/XXXX review. 
So sticking to your decision as a reply puts this in an never ending refusal that I can't overcome nor be a party too. 
Waiting on me to correct information you have, that really doesn't exists seems convenient for Wells Fargo Bank, N. A. to do what ever they want to anyone that may pose a red flag according to your policies on credit card activity. 
That being said, your reasons for reducing my credit line has nothing to do with my credit history, and everything to do with protecting Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. Credit Card Services internal policies by giving the consumer a false narrative. 
This conduct is likely unlawful."
2603,"First, let me begin by stating that my husband and I have no credit cards since we recently got out of debt. So, I find it odd that all of a sudden, two credit card accounts were opened in my name. Also, the online transfer of {$2500.00} from our savings to checking accout wasn't noticed quickly since the next day, an amount very similar, {$2400.00}, was debited from our checking account to pay a company in XXXX. 

I feel my identity has been "" stolen '' because in XXXX, I went to change my last name on my social securtiy card. They apparently mailed me a new card, but I have yet to receive it. I feel that my card with my social security number was taken or it got into the wrong hands. How else has someone found out enough of our information to do the following : XX/XX/19 : My identity was used to open a credit card account with XXXX XXXX Visa for an XXXX Product in the amount of {$1500.00}. The XXXX  statements shows 2 months of late payments but this is still in dispute. I have paid NOTHIHG to this account since I did not open it. As of XX/XX/19, this is in dispute. 

XX/XX/19 : Online transfer from my Wells Fargo savings account to my checking account in the amount of {$2500.00}. 
XX/XX/19 : My debit card was was charged {$2400.00} on my temporary card I had been given by Wells Fargo due to a previous frauduent charge on my former debit card. This charge of {$2400.00} was made to a company called XXXX in XXXX, XXXX. I live in XXXX, TX, USA. 
XX/XX/19 : Wells Fargo applied an online transfer credit reversal and temporarily credited my account {$2500.00} until they further investigated the charges. 
XX/XX/19 : Wells Fargo sent a letter which stated after research of my inquiry, they found the charges were made my me or someone who had my permission. They discussed this issue with parkbench.com and came to a conclusion without even speaking with me further. As a result, {$2400.00} was decucted on XX/XX/19. 
XX/XX/19 : I visit a WF Branch store and spoke to XXXX XXXX, who has been incredibly helpful, and she spoke with XXXX who refuses to refund my money. Then she called a WF representative in the Claims Assistance Center, and asked for WF to send all the proof on which they made their decision on. I was supposed to get it within 10 days, which would be on XX/XX/19. I have yet to receive this information, and it's XX/XX/19!!! 
XX/XX/19 : THEN, a HUGE MISTAKE made by Wells Fargo, for some reason the withdrew another {$2400.00} from our checking account! 
XX/XX/19 : I personally re-visited a Wells Fargo branch store, and spoke again to their employee, XXXX XXXX, and I showed her my bank account proving they withdrew an extra {$2400.00}, and once again disputed BOTH withdrawals. A few days later, they did credity my account with the extra {$2400.00} they had taken. I believe they owe us as well for the overdraft fees which we incurred because of their mistake. I also told her I hadn't received the proof that WF Claims Assistance said they'd mail in 10 days. 

XX/XX/19 : Another instance of my identity used to open a XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card account in the amount of about {$75.00}. The statement on XXXX  shows it's been paid, but I haven't paid anything for this since I did not open this account. It's in dispute as of XX/XX/19. 

I have filed a police report with the XXXX Police Department and I have put a fraud alert on my credit through XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. I have closed both our former checking and savings accounts and opened new accounts. I have also ordered new checks with new accout numbers on them. 

I would appreciate any help I can get on this matter. I also showed two open accounts on my XXXX report to show that we have always paid on time. I didn't even know that I hadn't closed these 2 accouts ... XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. 

Thank you."
2605,"I have a Wells Fargo credit card for more than 20 years now. I have not been using for many years and paid on the balance timely for all those years automatically from my checking account. instead of going down somehow my balance kept creeping up. that was not enough for Wells Fargo. they decided to rip me off by abruptly stopping taking automatic min payments and starting to charge me penalty APR and astronomical fees. I never received any calls or letters from them for months and I had no idea that they closed my Wells Fargo account and destroyed my credit report. I did NOT discontinue my automatic min payment, THEY are the ones that stopped taking the payments and posting them to my account. Most of my balance if not all on the Wells Fargo account are their bogus fees and 30+ % interest, my principle bal was probably just a few hundred $ $ if any at all. I tried to negotiate the acc or settle it but I could not get anywhere with Wells Fargo, it 's : pay what we want or XXXX, only threats and harassment. please help me to resolve this."
2606,"On or about X/XX/2017, I reported five credit card fraud transactions to Wells Fargo Bank totaling approximately {$4000.00}. I stepped into a XXXX XXXX and reported the fraud. All but two transactions were removed. Those two transactions, totaling {$790.00} were posted to my new card. It was subsequently determined that there was a breach in the Wells Fargo security and the bank determined I suffered from an account takeover. I reported again that these two transactions were fraud. The bank started an investigation and indicated that they determined they were legitimate transactions. I faxed a request for them to reconsider their decision and they reopened an investigation. In the meantime, I contacted the Wells Fargo fraud department and we determined that a "" fraudulent '' fraud report was generated at the XXXX XXXX branch on X/XX/2017. The fraud report contained "" fake '' fraud disputes of transactions of {$10.00} or less since XXXX 2017. These were legitimate charges. This is useful since I made credit card payments "" validating '' these fake fraud disputes since XX/XX/XXXX. When the real fraud dispute occurred in XX/XX/XXXX, I had made no payment since XX/XX/XXXX ; however,  the history of making payment against "" fraudulent '' fraud claims made the bank rule against me and forced me to honor the large transactions.The bank employee that filed the "" fraudulent '' fraud report no longer works there. I believe she was part of the scam ( knowing the bank business rules about paying on disputed claims ) and Wells Fargo know this and wants to cover up by sticking me with the bill. Wells Fargo has refused to provide a copy of the fake fraud report generated on X/XX/2017. They also indicated in their rejection letter that no new information was made available. This is not true since we determined that fraud claims on transaction prior to X/XX/2017 were fake."
2607,"Wellsfargo Bank Consumer Bankrupcy Team is failing to report to all 3 credit bureau XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX when my credit card account number XXXX endinging in XXXX for the credit card amount XXXX was discharge in Chapter XXXX Bankrupcy by the United States Bankrupcy Courts on XX/XX/2019 when they received the notice of the order of the Discharge notice showing that the credit card account number XXXX was paid off in Chapter XXXX Bankrupcy and Discharge by the Bankrupcy Courts. 
And reporting it as late payment and close account when is suppose to be noted as Paid and Discharge in Chapter XXXX Bankrupcy by the United States Bankrupcy Courts when they sent them the order of the Chapter XXXX Discharge notice showing that this credit card account was discharge in Chapter XXXX Bankrupcy and was Discharge on XX/XX/2019"
2614,"My credit card issuer, Wells Fargo Bank, assessed with an APR interest rate hike beginning in my XXXX of 2016 from a 9.490 % to a 28.740 %. This rate hike was a direct result of their Call Center staff incorrectly setting up an auto-payment which was to continue for 3 months while I was traveling internationally. In working with my the local Wells Fargo Banking Representative, a member of their XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and a member of their Small Business Lending Operations staff they corrected problem with three additional, but unrelated, accounts. I 've attempted to follow up for several months ( and have supporting documentation to include statements and emails if necessary ) regarding the status of this specific account but never received any resolution or a complete response. In contacting them today to follow up with this issue they insisted that "" they '' did, in fact, correct the issue but the account was delinquent. I informed them that I received no such notification and I then I proceeded to go through each invoice and read the interest rate and fee reversals to demonstrate the requests were incomplete. After that the representative informed me that they were not able to provide an alternative and advised me to contact the VP for the Small Business Lending Division ( XXXX XXXX ) but unfortunately I have yet to see any resolution."
2615,"The Wells Fargo credit card division is completely inept and is unable to accommodate a simple request. The retail banking division was provided a statutory durable power of attorney a week ago which was approved by their legal department to allow me to move funds from a family member 's account who is mentally ill. I have also advised to close a credit account, as well as debit card accounts and the credit card division, including their Executive office representative, is unable or unwilling to simply call the retail banking division 's Legal office to confirm receipt of the power of attorney in order to close the account. The account holder is in a dire condition and by not closing the account and continuing to allow access, Wells Fargo may be creating a dangerous welfare situation for the account holder. This is completely unacceptable. The individuals which were contacted are as follows : 1. XXXX - Customer Service 2. XXXX - Customer Advocacy 3. XXXX - Executive Office."
2616,I see multiple 30-60 days late marks which is a clear violation of my right under the FCRA. The company has never responded to any of my attempts to obtain any proof or documentation that will prove this account is being reported accurately.
2618,"On XX/XX/2021 I received a notice of suspicious activity on my card. Someone had spent {$950.00} at an online sportsbook called "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' This charge also came with an {$47.00} cash advance fee. So a total of {$990.00} was debited from my account. 

I called Wells Fargo to dispute the charge. While on the phone with the agent the Wells Fargo agent called a number associated with "" XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX '' and the sports book admitted they had suffered a breach and my charge was fraud. 

I was told the charge would be refunded within 5-7 days. I reminded then to include the {$47.00} cash advance fee. 

The fraud charge was never resolved. It remained on my account for months. I called continuously ( at least 6 times ) and each time I was promised that the charge would be removed in 5-7 days. 

I started getting late fees and interest charges. Each time I called the representative would refund the late fees but this still hurt my credit. 

Finally, in late XXXX the {$950.00} charge was resolved. However, as I suspected, they did not remove the {$47.00} and charged me another late fee. 

I chatted with an agent but she said she could only refund {$20.00} because of chat agent rules. I have tried calling again, but the wait is always over 45 minutes and I eventually get disconnected before reaching anyone."
2620,"In XX/XX/XXXX I informed Wells Fargo that I was hospitalized at XXXX  XXXX in XXXX. 2 days later Hurricane Harvey hit. I made partial payments as promised. They closed my account XX/XX/XXXX and even attempted to collect from my savings account causing that account to be closed. Now Ive been hit by Hurricane Nate at my own residence. I have tried to discuss this but to no avail, I keep getting transferred and spoke to 3 different people who could not help me on my last phone call. A similar thing happened to me with Wells Fargo on my business account. I was a victim of fraud-it took the bank longer than 30 days to investigate and they closed my account, although it was shown that I was indeed a victim of fraud. Not to mention, my account has been compromised so many times and I am the victim. Wells Fargo has been my bank since aroundXX/XX/XXXXand loyalty to customers obviously mean nothing to them. I have been harmed by their actions and was just notified tonight via email and online message that my accounts were closed. This is unfair and unscrupulous. I am a military spouse as well and this should never happen to a customer. Then they refuse still to work with me while Im experience such traumatic losses."
2627,"In XX/XX/2019, I purchased the a computer from XXXX, and they kept on delaying their shipping, due to numerous excuses, such as weather condition. After a long-time waiting, they suddenly claimed that they had delivered the package for me, although I did not receive any shipping information email from them. Since I never received any package, I had been contacting XXXX and the carrier for over 4 times, and all I got was they were trying to push the responsibility to each other. Then I disputed this transaction with my card issuer, and they called me on XX/XX/2019, indicating that they had received important information regarding to my dispute from XXXX, which was nothing but simply the delivery confirmation of my package, as the one I got from XXXX and the carrier before, and closed my case according, with nothing else they can do. Apparently, such result is totally unfair and unacceptable : 1. XXXX could simple send an empty package with a brick in, and claimed that it had been delivered.

2. I did not sign my package. According to the signature, it was signed by somebody else, but not me.

3. If the package was lost, it should be the seller, XXXX who need to take the responsibility to negotiate with their contacted carrier about the loss or their insurance company if they do have extra one otherwise."
2628,"*Below description. Also see attached supporting docs, please* I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX NJ on XX/XX/21 around the times of XXXX with my girlfriend. I might have had my credit card on the bar next to the running tab when I was ready to pay. When I went to close out my tab, the bartenders told me that the man across the bar took care of our tab so I didn't use my credit card. I only gave the bartenders a {$20.00} cash as tip. When I looked at my statement the next month, it had {$300.00} charge from the XXXX XXXX for that same day. 

I opened up a claim with my bank, Wells Fargo. After an investigation, Wells Fargo said the charge was authorized because the EMV Chip was used. I said that the charge wasn't authorized by me and reopened the case, giving them more info- I had my card out on the bar when i was ready to pay, which I hadn't told them before. After a second investigation, Wells Fargo came to the same conclusion. I opened the case again because I definitely didn't authorize this purchase and am still trying to get this money back. 

I had contacted the XXXX XXXX in the meantime to get any evidence that I could. They said they no longer had anything like a picture of the signature or any other evidence because it happened over a month ago and they didn't keep records for that long. Police report was also filed with all this info and sent to Wells Fargo."
2629,"on XX/XX/2019 I made a cash advance from a WELLS FARGO credit card to a WELLS FARGO checking account. I also have a large sum in my retirement accounts at WELLS FARGO. They charged me a fee of {$500.00} for this transaction that is in addition to the high interest rate they will charge monthly, and the interest charge I accept. l think this is such poor customer service and I feel practically like I have been scammed. I am sure there was some small print which I did not understand to be In Addition to the monthly interest charge. Also, in past months I felt I May be one of the names used for a fake account by them but strangely I could not access that information or add my name, for reasons I did not understand. I called customer service when I saw the charge of XXXX added to my balance and a supervisor ( XXXX ) says basically.. too bad, so sad, can not help you. No assistance was given. The main reason for my aggravation is that this transaction was all made within the same financial organization, Wells Fargo, I feel that this charge is excessive, that I was not properly informed, and an example of taking advantage of customers."
2631,"The problem I have was n't listed, so I choose what I thought to be the closest. My account was paid up, XXXX balance. I made the mistake of not deleting Wells Fargo from my payment calendar and on XX/XX/XXXX made a XXXX payment. When I realized the account had been paid off, I called my credit union to stop the payment but it had already been sent to Wells Fargo. I called Wells Fargo and they said they had n't received it but when they did, it would be credited back to my credit union account, in 5-10 days. On XX/XX/XXXX I still had n't received a credit to my credit union account, so I called WF again and spoke to XXXX in cust service. She said on the day I initally called, they had system problems and the transaction had not been processed and she would submit again. Check would be mailed, account not credited, in 7-10 days, by XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I called WF again because I had not received a check. I was told it had not been completely processed but as soon as it happened, the check would be mailed. I asked the man when the processing would be complete and he said he could n't give me a time frame. On XX/XX/XXXX I called again and asked to speak with a supervisor. I was connected to XXXX. He said a check for XXXX was sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX. I told him I never received a check and had no idea where the extra XXXX came from. He said an affidavit would be sent out in the next three days fo me to sign, saying I had n't received a check. Upon sending affidavit back, a check would be issued in 7-10 days. Address was confirmed. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I called back since I have n't received anything. Asked for a manager and was connected to XXXX. He said no affidavit would be issues for anything under XXXX and that a check had been sent to me and cashed on XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX. He said there was nothing he could do since there was a check cashed and he could n't verify I had n't cashed it. I went back to look at all my deposits from XX/XX/XXXX though today and there is n't a deposit for XXXX, XXXX or from anything other than my pension, SS, deposits from my kids when I babysit my grandkids or when I transfer to checking from savings account. He insinuated I could have cashed the check, for cash and just 'forgot '. I told him if I had done that, I certainly would n't be going through all this for XXXX and informed him I was going to file with FTC. He then connected me to the Executive Office. I spoke with XXXX who has created a case with their investigation dept. Case # XXXX. Agents name is XXXX XXXX. She is suppose to contact me in 4-5 business days."
2633,"I have been banking with Wells Fargo for over 10 years. I signed up for the XXXX XXXX card in XXXX 2017 with a signup bonus of {$200.00} back after $ XXXX spend in 3 months by clicking on an ad, and got confirmation from their credit card department via phone call that I am eligible for this bonus. I met the limit and months have passed without this bonus being posted. I called again and sent a message and they are now saying they do n't see that I am qualified and are not making an effort to help fix this. 

This offer has been around for a long time and is still being advertised online. I have never had issues with my bank balance nor do I have any credit issues. I have absolutely no idea why they would renege on the offer for just me, a loyal customer for over a decade."
2634,"This is regarding my Wells Fargo credit card account that was fraudulently used from approximately XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX. When I found out about the fraudulent charges, I had filed a claim with Wells Fargo, but the claim was denied due to the following reasons : 1. I have made multiple payments over the course of the few months while the fraudulent activity was ongoing. 
2. I have stated that my wife has dealt with this merchant before in the past. 
3. I have dealt with this merchant in the past on another Wells Fargo account associated with me. 

These transactions are NOT made by me, nor my wife, nor anyone authorized by me. 
XXXX / XXXX is a very big company, that does businesses in many areas, including online shopping, mobile wallet payment service, food delivery service, grocery delivery, etc.. They are somewhat like the XXXX, particularly XXXX, equivalent of XXXX / XXXX, so it is not surprising for anyone that has lived in XXXX, or XXXX in general, to have shopped there before. Please refer to my attached documents for the list of transactions and also my appeal letter as well. 

I was initially under the impression that these purchases could have been made by my wife, as she was in XXXX during some of the months in XXXX, and therefore it isnt out of the ordinary to assume so, based on the fact of how prevalent this merchant is in XXXX, and also due to the fact that she had shopped at this merchant before. As such, Ive made many payments to the card throughout the months, and did not report these transactions as fraudulent. 

The rationale behind making so many payments are mostly due to 2 reasons : My 0 % APR period is over, so I often make multiple payments to cards that do charge interests, which includes my Wells Fargo cards. Payments to credit cards are often made whenever I have readily available excess funds, either from deposits or from income, etc. My XXXX credit cards also had over 10-20 payments made within a month sometimes. The reasoning is to pay down the cards whenever possible, to reduce both balance and also interest fees. 

Also, sometimes the card seemed to be maxed out, and because I assumed the card was being used by my wife, I made additional payments to increase available credit, so that she can use the card and make additional charges, if the need arises. 

However, as I was going through our statements with my wife, I eventually found out that these transactions are NOT done by her. She did NOT use my Wells Fargo card for any of her shopping on XXXX / XXXX / XXXX. She had been using her own personal XXXX credit card for any transactions related to this merchant. 

These transactions are NOT made on my wifes XXXX account either. If you would like, I can provide you with the username and password where you can login to the account to verify if we had made those purchases. I personally do NOT have a XXXX account myself. 

As such, these transactions are NOT carried out by me, nor my wife, nor anyone authorized by me. To reiterate, I did NOT authorize anyone to carry out these transactions, nor do I know who carried out these transactions, nor did I do these transactions. I nor my wife, have NOT received any benefits, directly or indirectly, from these transactions as well. 

On top of that, I have tried to file a police report with the XXXX Police Department. However, because I am currently overseas, I am unable to do so as they require police reports with regards to such matters be made in person at the police station. I will however, be making the report in person at the XXXX Police Department once I do return back to the U.S.. Alternatively, if this would be ok, I can also file a police report in XXXX as well, as this is where I am right now. 

In my opinion, it is unfair to deny my claim simply because we had dealt with this merchant before. As an example for illustrative purposes, Ive dealt with XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX before as well. Does this mean that I am going to be responsible for any and every fraudulent activity that occurs at any of the above mentioned merchants simply because Ive shopped there and dealt with them before? Does this mean that I am only covered for fraudulent activity that occurred with merchants that I have never dealt with in the past? 

And because my wife had shopped at this merchant before, and being that we were in XXXX during parts of XXXX, and my wife was also in XXXX on her own without me during parts of XXXX, where this merchant pretty much dominates the whole online shopping market, it isnt out of the ordinary for me to think that the transactions were done by my wife. And also due to the fact that we have been traveling for an extended period of time in XXXX, I did not have as much free time to sit down and review my statements with my wife until we could finally have some free time to sit together and review everything. 

Our contacts thus far to this merchant has not been of any use. After speaking to a Wells Fargo representative on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I had attempted to contact the merchant again. My wife had tried contacting the merchant as well. This is a summary of my contacts with the merchant : Merchant has not been able to help much at all, if any. 
Merchant is a huge company, so during my attempts to contact them, Ive been transferred around to several different departments who kept saying that another department is in charge of such issues, such as the international department should be the department in charge of the account, and then someone else would tell us that instead of them, we should be talking finance department, etc. etc. In summary, each attempt to contact them has wasted a lot of time and effort to reach the correct department that is supposed to be able to or willing to help. 
Merchant has refused to disclose / been unable to disclose any particulars of the charges, including the address where the orders were shipped to, email address associated with the orders, etc. 
Merchant recommended that I contact my bank instead. 

I hope that Wells Fargo can investigate these transactions and come up with a fair conclusion. It is extremely unfair to put the burden of these transactions on me simply because my wife had shopped at this merchant in the past. While I understand that I should have realized and reported the fraud much earlier, and that certainly would have made things much easier and better, however I was traveling extensively at that time and didnt have a good opportunity to sit down and review things with my wife. 

If you need to reach me, please kindly reach me at XXXX, or through email at XXXX. I am still currently traveling overseas, so I am unable to receive any physical mail correspondence."
2638,"On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I was approved for the Wells Fargo Visa Signature card. The card came with 2 bonus offers : 1. XXXX points ( worth {$200.00} in statement credit ) after spending {$1000.00} within the first 3 months. 2. 5x points on gas, grocery, drugstore net purchases for 6 months I successfully completed the first offer XXXX XXXX points XXXX by my XXXX/XXXX/XXXX statement on which it showed a balance of {$4500.00}. I continued to take advantage of the remaining offer of 5x points by making purchases at grocery stores. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I logged onto the WF mobile app after having a transaction declined to find that my account had been closed by Wells Fargo. At that time of closure I had XXXX points pending on my account equivalent to {$160.00} in statement credit and had yet to be rewarded for successfully completing the first bonus offer ( XXXX points ). Thus, I had XXXX in pending rewards that I had earned while the card was open. When I called the WF Executive Office on XXXX at XXXX EST the representative noted my account was closed for rewards abuse. WF misled me by indicating that rewards would be earned in the amount of 5x for all purchases made at grocery, gas, or drugstores for the first 6 months. WF never indicated a cap on rewards or that spending more than they deem acceptable would result in account closure. I never spent more than my credit limit and made on-time payments. I feel that I was misled and treated unfairly."
2647,"I opened a Wells Fargo business credit card online in XXXX. Their credit card has 1.5 % cash back in every transaction. I spent XXXX on the credit card I should get XXXX dollars cash back but I didnt get any of it. I called Wellsfargo customer service many times. They said I didnt enrolled it. Its too late. What? 
This is the first time I heard that I should enroll the cash back by myself manually after I got approved on their credit card without any notice or call me let me know. So I called them they just declined it."
2649,"I made purchases on my personal credit cards for a company I was working for on the agreement I received reimbursement first before giving the products to the receiver. I was told to set up repayment on accounts through Wells Fargo. I was given account numbers and routing numbers from Wells Fargo to get reimbursed. I submitted my card balance after purchases and Wells Fargo paid my balance. After repayment I made additional purchases and was repaid through Wells Fargo. After about a month of this purchasing and repayments Wells Fargo returned all my payments and all the balances from the beginning were put back on my credit cards. My balances are up to 3 to 4 times the limit on my credit cards which proves payment. I have never been allowed to make a purchase over my limit on a credit card. This occured from the end of XX/XX/2018 through the end of XX/XX/2018. Once the payments were reversed I immediately called all my credit cards involved and let them know what happened and told them about the fraudulent payments. Then at the end of XX/XX/2018 my credit cards said I was responsible for the balances. I then contacted police, my credit cards again, Wells Fargo, three lawyers, The dept of consumer protection, and the OCC. The numbers of the accounts and routing numbers were all good from Wells Fargo when checked. I feel Wells Fargo should be responsible for paying my balances since they originally did so and lead me to believe the payments were legitimate. I have never been able to pay bills without money in my account. I do not have the money to pay back and my credit is destroyed."
2650,"On XX/XX/XXXX, i called wells fargo to cancel the new card that was opened fraudulently in my name. on XX/XX/XXXX the impersonator of me contacted wells fargo and they reopened the credit card that i received confirmation of being closed. On XX/XX/XXXX i received notice from wells fargo that the credit card that had been fraudulently reopened now had a balance on it of {$20000.00} of purchases that i have not made since i do not have this card. Wells Fargo has done nothing for me. the impersonator has opened many accounts at wells fargo in my name and i have closed all accounts at wells fargo and they keep reopening them. i need these accounts to be closed and noted that they are fraudulent."
2651,XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo open a secured credit card for {$300.00} under my name without my knowledge or consent. I just recently discovered this by checking my credit report other than that I have never been aware of this account. It also shows a highest balance of {$410.00}. The account was closed XX/XX/XXXX.
2654,"XX/XX/XXXX To whom this may concern, I have complaints against Wells Fargo. 

I went to the nearest Wells Fargo bank and closed my checking ( way2save checking account ) account with them recently on XX/XX/XXXX because I can not afford to pay the monthly service fee of {$12.00} for the checking account anymore. It had went up from {$8.00} through the years. I told them I'm having financial hardship and been struggling to make payments on all of my debts every month. I still could not find a job, although actively seeking and been trying to make only minimum payment each month since that's all I can afford. With their Credit card, I normally have {$62.00} or {$63.00} minimum payment each month which I have been paying for years, since I stopped making purchases and the last transaction I had with them was the cash advance last XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. For some reason I am not able to download this transaction online from my Wells Fargo account. I needed to send that money to pay a portion of my Dad 's medical bill before he passed away last XX/XX/XXXX. Reason why I emphasized this, it's because this is the reason the Wells Fargo agents over the phone is reiterating, that they raised the interest or principal due to this cash advance. This cash advance was made XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. Even after, I was paying the {$63.00} min each month. Why now? Why raise it soo ridiculously high to {$90.00}? 

So the Bank clerk was accommodating enough and we even talked about ways of saving money on a regular basis and how times are harder now. And so she closed my checking account upon request. She said I won't incurr any charges for closing my checking account and for any questions, I can always come back to them. 

But before closing the checking account, I made a payment online to my Wells Fargo credit card ( which remains active ) of {$63.00} for minimum payment on XX/XX/XXXX ( Which is the usual minimum amount I pay every month. I received an email from them XX/XX/XXXX that the check was cancelled, so I called my other bank, XXXX XXXX ( whose main acctholder is my spouse ). I also called Wells Fargo first which they told me its either 2 reasons : either the bank account is closed, or I don't have enough money in there to pay Wells Fargo. Neither are true. So I called my other bank, XXXX to verify. And they told me that neither are true and I should be good to go and that there's something happened in the transfer process but weirdly, can not identify it. So, I told them that as long as there is no unauthorized, fraudulent activity and that the transfer did not go through, I just have to pay Wells Fargo again, so XXXX XXXX  agreed with me. They said there was no problem at all with the account and the funds and wonders why Wells Fargo has a problem with it. And so I paid Wells Fargo again, the min payment of {$63.00} and this time, it cleared. 
So, on XX/XX/XXXX, it cleared and so, they offered to waive the late fee of {$27.00}. and I thought everything was good. 

However I am so suprised when I received my statement for XX/XX/XXXX, the minimum payment jumped to {$90.00} instead of {$63.00}. and so I called Wells Fargo to ask, they said it's because, the {$27.00} late fee that was promised to be waived, but did not clear yet. that's why it's {$90.00}. I said okay, I'll give it another day to clear then. 

And so I called again the next day and still i'm seeing {$90.00} as the minimum payment and this time the agent told me that yes, the {$27.00} late fee had been waived, but another {$27.00} was added to the principal or interest. And so I asked why, why it is soo super high. I understand that they have a discretion to raise the interest ( or whatever it's called ), a few dollars maybe reasonable but from {$63.00} to {$90.00}? It's very ridiculous and greedy and evil. 

Whoever I tell my story to, feels the same way. Why now? I feel, it is like a retaliation because I closed my checking account with them. These greedy big banks, keep on charging us small, poor people, just because they can. I think it's very unfair, injustice, and atleast I should have been notified prior to any changes. These calls did not get me anywhere. 

And so I called again the next day, and everytime I tell them my issue, the agents keep transferring me to another dept. I felt like they don't want to deal with me although I keep my cool and still be respectful as I can. They have the call recordings and I can attest to that. 

However on my, about 5th call in XX/XX/XXXX, I ask for a supervisor right away because I can not take it anymore when they have different excuses, or transfer me to another dept that did not have to do with my issue. 
The supervisor, XXXX was not able to help me as well, to put back my interest to where it was before and told me I just have to deal with that minimum amount of {$90.00} every month. 

{$27.00} is added to my monthly interest. I look at this as retaliation because I closed my checking account with them. Why now? Why this high? Why I was not given prior notice beforehand? 

And so the supervisor offered to transfer me to the higher officer of the bank who he said is incharge of interest rates. I talked to XXXX XXXX, of their customer care escalation dept who, is the same, not able to help me just like the supervisor. 
She can not answer my questions and remained on her position stating they have a discretion whether to raise interest or not, and if yes, they can raise it to how much, when ever they want, however they want. 

And so I told her that if that's the case, I can no longer make any payment at all every month. Definitely I can not afford the minimum of {$90.00}. When I'm even struggling to make my previous minimum payments of {$63.00} every month, but still paying it. 
But now that it is {$90.00}, I can not afford it and I wish them luck in collecting. 

This is so unfair, so ridiculously high, from {$63.00} to {$90.00}. So full of injustice and greed here. 
My other credit card debt did not do this to me. I have been paying them the same minimum amount every month since that's all I can afford for now. I never had problems with them. 

I just used to hear and watched bad news about how Wells Fargo is so dirty, dishonest and evil with theirs customers. 
Now, it happened to me too. whether on a different way. 

When I made it clear in the first place, I can not afford it anymore and now, here they go, raising the interest. How greedy and evil can they go? 

Unfortunately, even speaking with the higherup, did not resolve my issue. Reason why I am escalating this to Your Attorney General office.

I had escalated 2 issues/complaints with the Attorney General 's office months ago and those companies had finally admitted their mistakes and settled my issues, but I just don't want to do business with them anymore. 

I want to take this opportunity to thank your office and I hope that you can continue to help small people out there like me or may even in a much worse situation. 
This is not right and just for these big companies to continue to oppress less fortunate people. We are working hard and been doing all the sacrifices we need to survive, please help us simply live. 

We are not asking for free things. We ask that they be just and honest and deliver what they promise to their customers. Do what has been agreed upon and stop oppressing small people just because they can.

2656,"I refuse any Wells Fargo Bank N.A ( WF ) retaliatory forcing against me to enter any sort of arbitration and/or mediation at this point. An arrogance is that of WFs executives thinking they can do whatever.you know yourself and your will be held legally accountable for your violations against my person. I give consent to the CFPB to publish this complaint to the public to learn from my almost daily struggle with Wells Fargo bank N.A inhuman, reckless and continuous retaliation, harassment and blacklisting against me. Here again my information and little background so WF will have no excuse to avoid answering the real issues presented at least by this complaint. 

My full social security number is XXXX, my full legal name : XXXX XXXX. My mailing and billing address XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Virginia XXXX. I Also have one Wells Fargo bank N.A credit card  that is open and should remain open and I never requested it to be closed. The account I am complaining about can be pulled up with the above information and it is shown the full number of it in one of the attached files. Also my attached recording of proof shows what account exactly that i requested to be close but I faced unexplained refusal and/or resistance so I called again Wells Fargo but they impeded my ability and my request to close that account and keep it open against my will .I believe I was discriminated and retaliated against another time and by the same bank. My struggle : Wells Fargo Bank N.A ( WF ) discriminated, blacklisted and retaliated against my person and violated my rights to engaging in protected activities under the the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 2010 ( CFPA ). In addition to that, WF violated my rights under Title VI and any other as applicable from WF retaliation against my person as it will be explained herein and/or will be explained further elsewhere due to privacy and for security and safety reasons. I complained before about Wells Fargo bank N.A discrimination or retaliation to the government and this Bank is aware of it and continues its reckless intentional arrogance to target my person and blacklisted my information. the following is the latest from WF or Wells Fargo Bank National Association unlawful, discriminatory and retaliatory acts against my person : on XX/XX/2019 I called my WF credit card services or WF customers phone bank to request and close a WF account number that was opened under my social security number and under my other personal information and it has the last 4 consecutive digits XXXX ( account XXXX ) ( full account number is shown in an attached file ). This Account XXXX is shown as separate account in the WF online banking. Wells Fargo bank N.A refused to close this account when I clearly requested that in a first and a second same day on XX/XX/XXXX ). The two calls give enough chance to this Tyrant- mafia like organized bank to refrain from its refusal to close my account but they insisted and they did not close my account XXXX. Now, I authorize one of the two calls them to be public as permitted and as CFPB sees it it protects my rights and it is attached to this complaint and the CFPB to go ahead and do so please but restricted to government authorities a restriction that Only my consent or a court order that might left it. Those Two calls are my recorded privileged calls of me to Wells Fargo bank N.A proving that unlawful act to rejecting my request when I wanted to And to close my account XXXX and twice.Thus, After that refusal to my legitimate requests to close account XXXX and to my current state of belief and understating and without waiving my rights Under any circumstances, I believe I never signed any account application for that account XXXX and so its terms and conditions do no represent in any way something signed or agreed to it so whatever those terms and/or conditions of account XXXX Represents WF Only. In addition any of my accounts other than account XXXX.

refuse and object and reject and not authorized and I am not giving up my rights to any change to the existing and/or signed terms and/or conditions of each of those accounts other than account XXXX which I never agreed or signed to its terms and conditions at all as I explained and as to my current state of understating now not to be argued. Wells Fargo Bank N.A by  retaliating, discrimination and blacklisting my person using my information has declared its continuous outlaw and disrespect to the constitution. Who has jurisdiction and could stop this? I said it before and again I will never hurt myself or any other/s and if anything to happen to safety and life Wells Fargo Bank National Association and/or its involved agents and/or its involved executives should all individually and/or collectively be held criminally fully legally responsible and should be prosecuted to be sentenced to maximum possible sentence/s in a court of law and thus If I left forced and/or against my will by the above named, and it would be a fact then that I left as a martyr to the United States, Country, Citizens and its Constitution and to our democracy and values and what an honor it wouldve be. What a shame To the Other or WF. 
Without waiving my rights to Wells Fargo Bank N.A ( WF ). I am not  tolerating all what WF has being subjecting me in violation of the law as indicated herein or elsewhere. Wells Fargo bank N.A by its retaliating and Refusing to close the referenced account when I requested it ( I believe I have my freedom to choose what I want to do with my account, when I want that and as I wanted and freely without oppression, WF can not decide for me And is forbidden from that and is to stop invading my privacy and rights and stop its retaliation now ), its blacklisting Of my information and its several other unlawful adverse actions all will be brought to legal accountability without missing a single WF retaliatory occurrence against my person and WF will pay a huge legal consequences for its unlawful inhuman and reckless acts against me. I am afraid for my safety and life from harms by Wells Fargo bank N.A and/or its operators but I am not afraid to speak up about my rights. Anything in this complaint and/or Notice was to the best of my current state of knowledge and belief and understanding and it is subject to correction or modification by my person or representative/s if deemed necessary by my person or my representative/s at any time without prior notice and without waiving my rights."
2658,"This complaint is in followup to Complaint ID XXXX, which i submitted in XX/XX/XXXX. Details can be found therein. I have tried to work diligently with Wells Fargo for well over a year to address the small business credit cards Wells Fargo opened and assigned me personal liability. The account opening documents they provided me as evidence contain signatures nowhere close to my signature. I have documented the following details to Wells Fargo : 1. I was unaware of any application for their credit cards 2. The signatures attributed to me on the application forms, which they provided me at my request in XX/XX/XXXX, well after the accounts had been shut down, are clearly not mine. 3. Wells Fargo never contacted me to verify the applications before approving them. 4. I never activated or used any of the cards issued. Despite explaining these points to Wells Fargo multiple times in writing, Wells Fargo continues to insist no fraudulent activity occurred, and claiming i am responsible for charges on the cards they issued. Wells Fargo has avoided responding to the following points : - The signatures on their application forms are not mine. How could their employee possibly be unaware the application contained forged signatures? - Are n't employees required to verify the identify of an applicant by checking a picture ID? If not, why not? - How does Wells Fargo know its employee was not complicit in submitting a fraudulent account in order to meet a sales goal? - Did Wells Fargo have no controls in place in its account opening process to ensure the applications they receive are valid? Why was i not contacted to verify the application? Please help me to obtain resolution of this issue. Simply funneling my complaint on to Wells Fargo, then closing this claim, which you did in XX/XX/XXXX, obviously was not sufficient. Do let me know if helpful for me to provide you copies of communications between Wells Fargo and me regarding this issue."
2659,"Upon opening up a Wells Fargo checking account I was asked if I wanted a credit or debit card. I stated my desire for a credit card and sent a debit card. I check with the WF official and was informed that they ordered me a debit card as it offered me additional benefits. I asked about all the other benefits associated with the credit card and was informed that they were identical. 

Upon needing to use a credit card benefit, I was informed that the benefit was not on the debit card. Wells Fargo was contacted and a representive in the Executive Office indicated that there was an internal investigation and the bank was unable to help. 

This is clearly a matter where an employee, a number of years ago, went against my request and unilaterally sent a different card. Then the employee gave assurances that the card benefits were the same between the credit and debit card. 

A consumer should not be the subject of mis-information and the results of the internal investigation should be shared."
2660,A wells fargo credit card is affected my credit. I HAVE NEVER HAD A CREDIT CARD IN MY LIFE. That card belongs to my mother. I want this off my report now. This is wrong and inhumane. I feel I'm treated this way because of my race. This is wrong
2663,"I have a combined statement for a period for my Mothers account ( XXXX ) between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. There is a checking and savings account listed but no credit card. I also have a combined statement for XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. It lists a checking account, savings and a credit card ending in XXXX. I did not notice this until I went through the few hardcopy statements I have a few days ago. 
Since around XX/XX/XXXX and I was listed as POA, all statements or any mail from Wells Fargo was addressed to me or my Mother at my Tennessee address. There were never any credit cards sent for XXXX. At this point of time my Mother was having a lot of problems and we had to hire a neighbor so stay with her at times to make sure she ate something in the mornings or evenings and sometimes just to stay with her. My Mother was hospitalized XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. She would not have been able to request the card at the time in her condition. 
I understand that there were many accounts set up by Wells Fargo without the owners consent. This appears to be one of them. My concern is why was I not notified. It's to late to be a part of the class action.so what do I do. Is Wells Fargo off the hook for this or can the ignore it. How many other accounts were missed. I am expecting an answer from Wells Fargo."
2664,"I need some help, I mistakenly billed pay my mortgage payment to XXXX/Wells Fargo a closed credit card which was back in XX/XX/XXXX which was {$2200.00} and not my mortgage company. There was nothing my bank could do because it was a bill pay, I have been trying to get my funds and it has been so hard. It has been three months, I'm behind on my mortgage now also. Not only do I still do not have my money now I have negative remarks on my credit file due to this. I'm not rich and that is a lot of money which I could not replace. I really feel that XXXX/Wells Fargo doesn't care it's there there life this is affecting. I have been told many different things, check was mailed, didn't get in the mail, called again today and spoke with XXXX at the executive offices XXXX ext XXXX and he put in another complaint as the first person would not return my calls XXXX XXXX # XXXX. Now I'm with a XXXX XXXX new # XXXX. I have stressed the important of this as I need to give this money to my mortgage company I was told another check was mailed on XX/XX/13 and still waiting.

2666,"Had a {$2500.00} credit limit and over night with no ch ange in credit score or missing payment or even a late payment ever, I had {$800.00} balance and they changed limit over night, and I have set it up to auto pay my bills. By doing this they have affected my credit score negatively in the most important way because it changes account balance/ to credit limit ratio. This is not fair and it happens all the time with banks of all kinds. They offer you credit and when you use it they lower credit limit to cause credit report to go down and then they can charge a higher rate of interest?"
2667,"On or about XX/XX/XXXX, my Wells Fargo Cashback Visa Signature card 's limit was inexplicably dropped from {$9000.00} to {$2800.00} - which, at that particular time, was actually beneath the current balance owed ( approximately {$2900.00} ). This set me up to have to use valuable funds from a Wells Fargo serviced PPP loan due to the Coronavirus pandemic to make an emergency lump sum payment after deliberating and attempting to work it out with customer service ; I will explain in what follows how unethical I consider this situation, and what steps I reasonably expect to take if no action is delivered in a timely manner from Wells Fargo. 

I am a XXXX XXXX and ( XXXX  ) XXXX XXXX for a living, in multiple states but especially Arizona, where my accounts were originally set up. I have been with Wells Fargo for about 8 years as a long-term small business checking customer ; recently, due to the unfortunate events of the pandemic in 2020, I was forced to apply for life and business saving funds, which my local business banker ( XXXX XXXX ) graciously helped me connect with ; Wells Fargo is my PPP Loan servicer. My personal account, the Visa Cashback card, has been open for going on 6+ years, and I always make my payments on time. The card has also been fully paid off at least once in the past. 

Due to the dire financial situation created by the Coronavirus and shutdown / lockdown orders of the entire country, I was forced like many Americans to use ( some ) of my credit cards. My Wells Fargo Visa card 's balance was less than 30 % utilized by the end of XXXX, with a statement balance of just {$2300.00} ( again, out of a LOC of {$9000.00} ). 

I was so worried about the risk to my credit, by virtue of my limit dropping to beneath the current balance owed on XX/XX/XXXX, and actually ( instantaneously and without warning ) putting me OVER my limit, with no fault of my own having taken place, I was forced to make a lump sum payment beyond my minimum the following week, after efforts to reinstate my LOC clearly failed as indicated by letters sent by the bank. I was afraid of my FICO being negatively affected, and it almost certainly has been by Wells Fargo 's unethical Corporate behavior. 

I am offended as a long term customer, a small business customer, and someone who has received a PPP Loan serviced by Wells Fargo, and was forced to use part of that money not for my business, but for a larger payment on a personal credit card. 

I feel strongly I should bring this to the attention of the media and both traditional news outlets with which I have a relationship, and also my extensive social media network. After Wells Fargo 's account opening scandals of just 2 years ago, I feel it would be both in my and also the public 's best interest to do this, and I have every intention of doing so if a resolution is not reached. I am a XXXX XXXX especially in the context of what I do for a living, and have been interviewed previously with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as sources in the XXXX Arizona area."
2668,"XXXX has been non-compliant with removing the unverified account WELLS FARGO CARD SER which has been deleted by XXXX and XXXX. XXXX and XXXX have both completed their research and determined that WELLS FARGO CARD SER was not established by myself but XXXX keeps verifying this accounts. Also, when I called the company they responded that XXXX did not send them all of the verifying evidence to confirm each account is unverified."
2675,"On XX/XX/XXXX I opened a Wells Fargo business XXXX XXXX with an attached offer of spend XXXX get XXXX back. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I made a purchase of XXXX on said credit card. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I did not receive the bonus offer of XXXX cash back. 
On XXXX I called and after being transferred around for over an hour and being told that I did not receive the bonus because it was not attached to my account, I did not make eligible purchases, and I was not enrolled in the correct reward program which they set up for me. They told me there was nothing they could do even though it was their fault for having two reward programs neither of which the user has the ability to pick from."
2679,"On  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX   I filed an unauthorized dispute for transaction  XXXX  on my CC. This transaction occurred at a gas station on the West coast. I live in  the Midwest and   have not used that card on the  West  coast ever. Their fraud models missed the clearly inconsistent activity of this card use.     Although my account is completely services online, I was sent a physical letter requesting additional confirmation from me that the transaction was unauthorized. The letter required me to check a box and sign it. Then mail, fax, or drop off a copy of the letter at a branch.     I called into the customer service center to verbally report the unauthorized transaction on  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX  , and I was once again told I would need to do this additional step to report the transaction.     Considering all other aspects of the account are serviced online, this additional physical letter requirement to file a dispute, appears to be an intentional deterrent to filing a dispute. The entire dispute process should be able to be done online."
2680,"On XX/XX/19, I called Wells Fargo because I noticed my credit card had been closed without any notice to me. This card not only had a XXXX available limit but was also my longest held card so it is an important part of my credit score. My call was escalated twice as employees noticed that it was odd that Wells Fargo hadn't contacted me previous to closing the account. On XX/XX/19, I received a call back from Wells Fargo and they told me that they can not reopen the account. I am concerned about this practice of closing credit accounts without notifying the card holder. I carry the card in my wallet and could have used it at any time to avoid closure if I knew that was going to happen. In fact, I was told that the normal practice is to send a letter about 6 months prior to closure and only require that the customer contact Wells Fargo to keep the account open. I was not afforded that opportunity and now my credit will take a significant hit leading to other consequences."
2682,"Wells Fargo sent me a letter today, dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating that they were closing my account on my credit card. This is the first notice and information that I have heard of the closing of my card/account from them. There have been no phone calls and letters up to this point. I had even been on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX talking to a banker, XXXX, who told me that I was not getting a new credit card because I had a past due amount. I was going to make a payment on the XXXX of XXXX when I got my paycheck. There was no mention on the phone of them closing my account even though XXXX checked with his supervisor to find me an answer to my question. 

When I called the number listed on the letter today, I spoke with XXXX who informed me that my account had become "" delinquent '' with my account and that was why they were closing it. I asked her when that happened and she checked with her supervisor and stated that I was not keeping my account current and that it had become delinquent. I went through my statements again and no where on any of my statements was my account delinquent or was I sent other letters letting me know that I was falling behind on the account. I have been making monthly payments and keeping up with my account, even if it was late. XXXX then stated that they ( Wells Fargo ) had been sending me letters about my account being delinquent. I have never received these letters so who knows where they actually went. The letter that I got today still had my maiden name on it even after I have sent them the necessary documents to inform them of my legal name change to my married name. So between these letters that were sent and the issue with my name on the letter, this letter was the first one that I have received in a long time. 

I have been banking with them since XXXX and I have worked with them on this credit card for several points. The due date for the payment of the bill is the XXXX and I have worked with them 5 separate times to get the due date moved to another date because I only get paid two times per month and the XXXX is not a good date to have a bill due. On each of these five times, I was told that I could not move the due date."

2689,"Wells fargo took back a merchant credit and closed my claim due to "" Reversal of Excess Credit Due to Merchant Credit Claim '' but never once contacted me regarding this. The supposed "" merchant credit '' was a refund from a separate purchased on a completely different debit card. I've contacted them every day for the last 2 months and have never received a call back or been able to speak to any agent that could help. 

I've also contacted corporate and filed at least 3 complaints and still have not been able to speak to anybody who can help. 

Dispute date : XX/XX/20 Dispute amount : XXXX Actions taken by company : They never ONCE called me to ask for more info or anything telling me they didn't need info. I provided all receipts for returns of the items emails and even tracking # s to prove that I did in fact return the merchandise and was not credited. Its despicable that I haven't been able to get an agent on the phone who could help for well over 2 months and at this point i'm at a loss for what to do."
2690,"I have had a Wells Fargo credit card for years. I always make automated payments by providing my checking account routing number and account number. Recently I moved my checking account to a new bank. I need to give my new routing number and account number to Wells Fargo so my account will not become delinquent. I tried providing the information on the website but found it to be impossible. I tried sending an email through the website message system and was told i had to call an XXXX number. I tried the XXXX number and was told they can not take this information over the phone. In other words, Wells Fargo makes it impossible for me to make this payment and just wastes my time with runarounds."

This is not what it says online when you transfer. Only 12mths plus 4 % bal. transfer fee.

Extremely misleading and I called Wells Fargo and they said that they would no help me."
2692,"We expected a Gym Membership to begin in early XX/XX/XXXX, along with personal training sessions for two people. For a gym that was still under construction and not yet opened. 

We worked with a gentlemen named XXXX. He identified himself as the GM for the XXXX and XXXX location. He looked me in the eyes and gave me his personal commitment that he would not complete any billing until he reached out for confirmation. At the time I only had one card with me and it would be expired by the expected XX/XX/XXXX open date. 

XXXX advised not to worry, that he would call for updated information and expiration date before processing any billing. 

Before agreeing I had expressed to him concerns over hard to cancel memberships this is where he gave reassurance that we would never experience that with their company, as we were signing up under their PRE SALES agreement. He politely pointed out the agreement showing the EASY cancellation policy. 

-- -He gave me an EFT authorization form with the PRE SALES CLAUSE AT THE BOTTOM -- -this form showed I was agreeing to membership and annual fee totaling {$120.00} -- -and then ANOTHER AGREEMENT on a separate sheet of paper FOR Personal training with the words PRE SALES at the top in parenthesis- totaling {$630.00}. This did not have the clause written on the bottom, just the words Pre-Sales at the top. He assured me that it said PRE SALES at the top of the PERSONAL TRAINING visit and they would follow their PRE SALES CLAUSE from my EFT form. 

AND THE AGREEMENT PROVIDED STATES -- "" any member that signs this agreement prior to the clubs opening will be allowed to cancel this agreement within 30 days of the clubs opening for any reason. By cancelling this agreement in the first 30 days, they will have no further obligation to any contract or commitment that they have signed for '' The gym never opened as expected until XX/XX/XXXX. No contact was made to advise of delay or even what was going on. I knew that the contact would need to be made as my card had expired XXXX of XXXX and they would have to reach out to me for new expiration ( as XXXX and I discussed during sign up ) I was astonished when I was notified by my financial institution that my card was over the limit -- Related to the fact THEY OPENED THE GYM AND BILLED ME! They never reached out as promised and were still successful in passing the transaction through my financial institution. 

We were less than pleased and decided at that time, this was not a company we wanted to do business with. When we reached out to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, he advised they had called to tell us they were open and the billing would begin. 
I advised there was no contact from him regarding billing, update to my credit card information etc. He said he had all that on file. I was perplexed -- how did he have my new information on file, if we never talked. He said, I see it right here your card expires in XXXX. This was not correct -- The card I gave him is written out with XXXX expiration. I advised him of this oversight. At that point He agreed to refund the charges in 48 hours. 

By Monday XX/XX/XXXX there was not any activity on my account. HOWEVER I did receive a voicemail from the merchant on this dateconfirming that he would refund it and set it to withdraw on XX/XX/XXXX like I had asked. That is not what I askedit is what he told me had to happen in order for his manager to allow a refund. I promptly called him back and was sent to voicemail. I left a message advising I had not asked for any additional billing in XXXX, I was cancelling under the promise and written contract he provided. He never replied after that and never promised refund. 

We never received services, never even set foot in the location, as this was a PRE-SALE, he advised we would be able to try it out for a week before completing commitment so we could be sure it was for us. 

Now that we have advised we are no longer interested, he is stating we must pay anyways, even though the agreement states otherwise. 

I attempted to reach out to their management team, only to be told they are local only and I will have to deal with the manager at the facility. This happens to be XXXX. 

The merchant verbally promised one thing, provided documents that supported their commitment -- -- and my financial institution refused the dispute, based on the fact that the merchant provided them with ONE DOCUMENT only the second document with the words PRE SALES at the top, but no PRE SALES clause. The merchant did not provide all documents, or explain PRE SALES clause which is written on my agreement to be a memeber! YOU have to be a member in order to get personal training! Wells Fargo has found in favor of the merchant on the {$630.00} agreement. However I was advised in my favor on the {$120.00} due to the fact that the PRE SALES cancellation clause is written out and not just highlighted at the top of the page. 

I had two witnesses with me at the time of the sign up that would be willing to give statements. I have all signed documents, and voicemail from XXXX confirming he would refund. 



WELLS FARGO PORTION FOR WELLS FARGO COMPLAINT -- My Wells Fargo Credit Card had expired XX/XX/XXXX. I am unsure how they pushed through a billing with an expired card on file, I have my original sign up paperwork with the card info and original expiration date. 

XXXX advised me that he had an expiration of XXXX???? That is strange because my new card expires in XXXX, and his paperwork shows my old expiration date of XXXX -- unsure how he was able to push this through. 

The merchant verbally promised one thing, provided documents that supported their commitment -- -- and my financial institution refused the dispute, based on the fact that the merchant provided them with ONE DOCUMENT only the second document with the words PRE SALES at the top, but no PRE SALES clause. 

The merchant did not provide all documents, or explain PRE SALES clause which is written on my agreement to be a memeber! YOU have to be a member in order to get personal training! Wells Fargo has found in favor of the merchant on the {$630.00} agreement. However I was advised in my favor on the {$120.00} due to the fact that the PRE SALES cancellation clause is written out and not just highlighted at the top of the page. 

I asked Wells Fargo to re-open the dispute as the paper with the PRE SALES clause written out was to apply to both agreements with the words PRE SALES on them, in addition I provided the WAV file from the voicemail XXXX had left. They advised they can not review the dispute again as even with those details it is the same dispute reason. They found in favor of the merchant and if I needed a refund I needed to work with the merchant. 

I don't understand how they can refuse the bait/switch ambiguous documents making the consumer think something is easily able to be canceled/ when it is not. In addition the bank advised that WAV files were not able to be used in disputes, even though my cell phone company can confirm date/time location of caller. 

The Wells Fargo team escalated to Executive offices for XXXX XXXX Case # XXXX -- on XX/XX/XXXX -- I was to receive a call back at XXXX XXXX XXXX within 3 buisness days. his number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX -- he did not return my call, nor did executive offices respond to a voicemail I left them earlier this week, asking why I had not received a follow up. 

The bank admits that the merchant did just enough to allow XXXX to push through the billing, and well they feel bad that happened, they simply can not escalate any further to XXXX. 

XXXX never called back to confirm why or why not. So I no longer have any ability to dispute through them. They did not protect my account nor were they willing to resubmit additional details to XXXX. I am unsure if you needed these details about WellsFargo or if those should go elsewhere. 

I mentioned this to Wells Fargo, they advised the merchant didn't need any additional updated information as when I signed up with the card, whether it was expired or not they pay it out. 

It is unclear to me how I have all the documentation, you can see how the merchant utilizes the phrase PRE SALES. I point this out to Wells Fargo only to have them advise that is the same info as is on initial dispute and nothing more could be done."
2696,"I received the platinum card from Wells Fargo. The payments were being taken out of my checkings account monthly and on time. The company explained that I was approved for an upgraded card with a larger limit. The company closed the account because they said it was nit activated by me in a certain time frame. I did not receive the card to activate it. I have paid the full amount owed which was {$860.00}, and there is no balance due."
2698,"On    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX     2017  I have deposited a {$1000.00} into  a Wells Fargo bank  for the purposes of opening a secure credit card. I was told that I will have an answer in no more than a week and a credit inquiry will appear on my credit report.   It has been over 2 months now, and there is still no credit inquiry and no credit card.   After not seeing any action after a month I have repeatedly asked for my money back, since the bank does n't even bother to verify my credit I have been told that the banker will call me back in 2 days.   NO ONE ever called me, and when I show up at the branch, which I did 4 times now, I am told that I will get my money in  2 weeks. It has been over 5 weeks since the first time they told me 2  weeks.   I got the same answer today.   And yes, the banker will call me back in 2 days again.   I do n't believe them anymore."
2703,"I have good reason to believe that Wells Fargo is fraudulently double charging me for a payment I made on XX/XX/2021 The dispute stems from a fraudulent balance transfer charge to my lost credit card. I have attached supporting documentation in the form of my two last credit card statements, a pdf of my card running balance as of XX/XX/2021 and a downloaded account activity spreadsheet ( from Wells Fargo ). I have tried repeatedly to settle this with Wells Fargo ; I have spoken to Wells Fargo on the phone three different times and I had an in-person meeting at the local Wells Fargo branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, PA XXXX. I dont know if this is an innocent error they have made or a purposeful attempt to commit fraud. In any event everyone I have spoken to at Wells Fargo is using the same distort logic to charge me a second time for a payment I have already made. 

The story begins as follows. On XX/XX/2021 I misplaced my Wells Fargo credit card # XXXX. I called them the next day and reported the lost card. They said they would close the account and send me a replacement. On the day I lost my card the balance on the card was {$2700.00}. Wells Fargo did not actually close this credit card account on XX/XX/2021 as they claim, they merely renamed it # XXXX. This renamed account # XXXX had all the previous charges of account # XXXXfrom XX/XX/2021 XXXX the current billing cycle at that time ). On XX/XX/2021 they added a charge to the account and called it a balance transfer. This fraudulent balance charge was for {$2200.00}. This {$2200.00} charge was identical to the payment I made on XX/XX/2021 for the previous months balance. Now my balance jumps from {$2700.00} to {$5000.00}, because of the fraudulent charge of {$2200.00}, which I had already paid on XX/XX/2021. Please see the attached pdf file labeled XXXX Card XXXX Running Balance XX/XX/XXXX I have exhausted all my options with Wells Fargo. They told me ; they are right and I am wrong and that I have pay the fraudulent charges. Please look into this matter and advise me."
2705,"For second month in a row - I have paid my balance in full and Wells Fargo Propel will not credit payment to my available credit.

The company says that I authorized payment from a business account ( where I am an authorized signer and owner of business ) and that they have elected to put a 30 day hold on my payment. Before making payment via ACH - I explicitly verified I am certifying I am authorized to make payments from this account in their app.

Last month I also paid balance in full - and they put an 8 business day hold on crediting to my available credit. Now, I have a 30 day hold on my full balance payment made exactly the same way.

I asked them to simply return the payment to my bank account if they didnt like where it came from - but they have refused. If they did so, I would simply receive the money back and pay from a non-business account. They have refused to resolve this so I have no option but to open an complaint with the authorities on Wells Fargo Propel.

I dont wish to open a checking account at Wells Fargo at this time. I am already a mortgage loan holder with Wells Fargo for 12 years - so my credit relationship with the bank is not a new one."
2714,"I have a dispute with XXXX, the car rental, and i brought it to my bank 's, wells fargo, attention, the money was returned and from the conversation we had it was my understanding that the dispute had been resloved. A few days go by and now my bank is over-charging the disupted amount to turn my account and charge me excessive fees. They have charged my account over by 300 $ and keep on doing it regardless of my repeated attempts to tell them otherwise"
2716,I opened a credit card with Wells Fargo 8 months ago. This credit card offers zero percent for 15 months. I received a credit limit of {$7000.00} and I have used {$4600.00} of it. I have never been late. I have only been making my minimum payments because it is a zero percent credit card and I was not in a hurry to pay it off. I was focusing on other debt which does charge interest. Wells Fargo Lowered my credit line to {$4800.00} because I was only paying my minimum payment. I feel like this is very unfair because I have never been late and their decision to lower my credit will impact my FICO score negatively. I feel that they are judging me because I am a XXXX and automatically assume that I will be most likely to default and thats why they reduced my credit limit. I have banked with them for over twenty years and they see my transactions and my activity. There was no reason for them have lowered my credit limit.
2717,"My name is XXXX XXXX and I am sending this message on behalf of my mother, XXXX XXXX XXXX. My mother is XXXX years old and lives with me due to health issues. My mother has XXXX XXXX which has impaired her XXXX XXXX to the point that she has not been able to drive for the past year. My mom has recently been a victim of identity theft and credit card fraud which included unauthorized purchases on her XXXX  credit card that is issued and administered by Wells Fargo. I made contact on XX/XX/XXXX to report the fraud and as of today have yet to receive an appropriate resolution. Since Wells Fargo has yet to provide me with any documentation such as an affidavit of fraud and forgery, I feel it is necessary for me to document the occurrences I have experienced over the last month regarding this issue.

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX received a call from XXXX XXXX regarding an attempted charge on her XXXX XXXX card. She informed them that she was at home and was not attempting to make any purchases. At that time the representative notified her that they would cancel her card and deny the transaction. At this time we confirmed that all of her credit cards were in her possession.

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX received a credit card in the mail for a store by the name of XXXX. She immediately showed me the card and stated that she did not even know what store this was. I called the number on the back of the card to report that this card was opened and was not my mother. They informed me that they were closing the card and would send me an affidavit to sign and return stating that this card was not authorized to be opened by her. They also informed us that this card was opened at a store in XXXX and used on the same day for purchases in the amount of {$480.00}.

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX received a credit card in the mail for a store by name of XXXX. Once again she immediately showed me the card and stated that she had not been to an XXXX store and did not open a card. I called the number on the back of the card to report that this card was opened and was not my mother. They inform due that they were closing the card and would send me an affidavit to sign and return stating that this card was not authorized to be opened by her. They also informed us that the card was opened at a store in XXXX  and was used on the same day for purchases in the amount of $ {$490.00}.

Also on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX received a credit card statement from XXXX XXXX. This is an active card that she has had for years and has not used it in a very long time. The statement had charges in the amount of $ {$1200.00} ( {$850.00} at a mall in XXXX and {$440.00} at a mall in XXXX   County ).

Based on the events above, we came to the conclusion that we possibly had a bigger problem on our hands. At this time a call was placed to XXXX to place a freeze on her credit so that no other new cards could be opened in her name. The confirmation number is XXXX. They sent notification to the other two credit bureaus. I received notification via mail from XXXX and XXXX acknowledging the freeze. After completing this step, we retrieved XXXX XXXX credit report from XXXX to ensure no other accounts had been opened. Once we determined that there was not any other new accounts, I began to review all of her other accounts online to determine if there was any other unauthorized activity on her other active credit card accounts. Upon that review we identified that a few other accounts had fraud on them : XXXX- {$450.00} on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX- {$1100.00} in XXXX  & {$1900.00} in XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. An attempted transaction on the XX/XX/XXXX in XXXX  which the purchase that prompted the call to my mom on that day to inquire if she was attempting to make the charge.

XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX- {$690.00}, {$330.00}, {$120.00}, {$880.00} @ XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX- {$960.00} and {$420.00} @ XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX- {$1000.00}, {$300.00} @ XXXX XXXX XXXX   XX/XX/XXXX- {$780.00} @ XXXX XXXX All of the above Merchants were contacted on XX/XX/XXXX. Everyone with the exception of XXXX/Wells Fargo, provided me with a case number followed up by an affidavit of fraud and forgery to complete and return. Along with notifying the impacted merchants, we also took the liberty to contact all other credit card companies that XXXX XXXX had accounts with. We informed them of her current situation and each one of them recommended that her existing card be closed and new one be issued just to be cautious. They also recommended that we go online and set up any alerts that we possibly could in their online system to receive notification of any future purchases. On cards where that was the option, we set alert limits at {$150.00} to be sent via text and email.

In regards to the initial claim filed with XXXX/Wells Fargo, I have been less that satisfied with how this has been handled. After my initial call, I received no affidavit of forgery or request for additional information. The first contact we have had with XXXX  after our verbal claim on XX/XX/XXXX was a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX which stated the following- Our investigation shows that the activity was verified at time of the transaction. Any temporary credit you may have received will be reversed and the amount will be reapplied to your balance. On XX/XX/XXXX, I placed a call to XXXX and spoke with someone by the name of XXXX. In speaking with him he stated that the charge in the amount of {$490.00} on XX/XX/XXXX was proven to be valid and that is why the claim was declined. I informed him that we were not disputing the charge @ XXXX in XXXX  on that date or for that amount as that was a valid charge. It was the other nine charges ( listed above ) that were in dispute. I explained that I was very specific with this information when filing the claim on XX/XX/XXXX. He informed me that the claim was filed wrong and the he would have to submit it for reconsideration. He asked if I had filed a police report and I informed him that I had not. Being that this had never happened to us before, we were not sure of what steps needed to be taken completely. He told me at that time that it might help my claim if I was to file a police report. I agreed and stated that I would take that step as soon as we hung up the phone. I expressed to him at that time that I was very disappointed that we were back at square one due to the first agent filing the claim incorrectly. I also asked him why had I not received an affidavit of fraud or forgery as I did with the other impacted merchants. He never answered the question and explained that he was submitting the claim and someone would in contact. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to inquire about the status of the claim. Initially I spoke with an agent by the name of XXXX. Somehow were disconnected so I called back and spoke with an agent by the name of XXXX. In speaking with him he stated that he would resubmit the claim and I should hear back within 7-10 days. I questioned if XXXX and done so upon speaking with him on XX/XX/XXXX, why would he need to do the same thing? This made me question whether XXXX had completed what he promised he would do when we spoke. At this time I had filed a police report so I provided XXXX  with that number. After my interaction with XXXX, I hung up but did not feel good about the conversation or how it appeared that XXXX  did not do what he promised. XXXX did not ask for the officers number or the police station that I filed the claim. I called back and spoke with an agent by the name of XXXX. I asked to speak with a manager in which she stated that there was not one on site. I asked if she was in a call center in which she replied yes. I stated that I found it hard to believe that there was not one on site. She changed her statement saying that one was not available. I explained why I needed to speak with one in which she recommended that I contact the Executive Offices. She provided me with that information and we ended our interaction. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from XXXX  with the Executive Offices. I explained the situation to her and after speaking with XXXX XXXX to confirm that I am handling this on her behalf, she listed to complaint further. Once again, I expressed concern that no affidavit of forgery was sent to us allowing us the chance to formally dispute the charges. She did not speak to why this was the case but once again assured that this would be reviewed and that I would hear something within 10 days. For the first time since reporting this issue on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a tracking number # XXXX. XXXX  informed me that the research analyst assigned to this case would be XXXX XXXX. She provided me with her number and her ext in the event that I had any questions/concerns. Most recently, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating the following, The fraud department has advised us that your claim has been denied. However, you may have this decision reconsidered. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made contact with XXXX  and she informed me that the case was actually being researched by XXXX XXXX but that she was out of the office. XXXX then took the time to review the file and informed me that she was going to open a new case ( ID XXXX ). She asked me to email and to fax over any statement of supporting information that would support my claim and request for reconsideration. I expressed my frustrations with her and ONCE again questioned why I had not received an affidavit of fraud or forgery to sign. Just like the other agents I have spoken with, she did not address that concern but instead apologized for my experience and assured me that she would try to help. During this conversation she informed me that due to a new case number being assigned, they would need to have my mothers permission to speak to them on her behalf regarding this issue ( regardless of the fact that this had been obtained multiple times since XX/XX/XXXX ) and by the Executive Offices on XX/XX/XXXX. She explained that this was policy and I expressed that I felt this was another attempt of XXXX/Wells Fargo to prolong the investigation and to complicate matter for my mother to find resolution. XXXX XXXX was out of town on XX/XX/XXXX when I spoke with XXXX  and I informed her that she would return on XX/XX/XXXX and we would make the call as soon as she returned. This called was placed and a message was left for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX. I would also like to note that when speaking with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I stated that my payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked if I need to make the minimum payment and I was told no since the account was under review. Due to this, no payment was made. I received my statement for this month and it shows a past due balance due to no payment last month. I will be making the minimum payments this week as I acknowledge the charge of {$490.00} conducted on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX  was my mothers. I do request that the late fee be refunded and that it not reflected as late on her credit due to misinformation.

As you can see from the narrative above, a lot of time has been spent regarding this issue ( especially with XXXX/Wells Fargo ). Other merchants/credit cards companies have been very communicative and diligent in the handling of this issue. XXXX  had already concluded their investigation and have sent a letter stating that the matter is closed and resolved. Attached to this email are the following : 1 ) Letters from XXXX   and XXXX showing that contact was made to place a freeze on XXXX XXXX credit.

2 ) Letter from XXXX XXXX regarding the XXXX account that was opened as part of identify fraud. This letter shows that the investigation is closed and there is NO liability.

3 ) Video still image from XXXX  police showing the individual who opened the account at XXXX  in XXXX XXXX name.

4 ) Copy of XXXX XXXX Drivers license.

5 ) Copy of Police report filed with the XXXX PD. It was filed on XX/XX/XXXX with Officer XXXX @ XXXX. Police report number is XXXX. When speaking with Officer XXXX, he stated that he would forward my case to the other precincts on my behalf. Soon after, I did receive a call from XXXX PD- Officer XXXX XXXX . His phone number is XXXX and the case number is XXXX.

As I have stated multiple times, XXXX XXXX is willing to visit any XXXX  or Wells Fargo location to identify herself and to sign any affidavit necessary to resolve this matter. If she is familiar with who the individual is after reviewing pictures/video, she is more than willing to provide information and to prosecute. This claim has been denied twice ( once due to the first claim being filed incorrectly ) and is now under review for a third time under a new case number. I am asking that any documentation that can be obtained via video or otherwise, be used along with the information that I have provided to clear this case. If this case is to be declined a third time I am requesting the following : Contact number to the highest representative in the Executive Office.

Details of any efforts made along with and specific information obtained from the transaction to reach an unfavorable conclusion ( including any footage obtained from store ).

Documentation on what is protocol within your organization once someone reports fraud ( what is required of the customer and how is this communicated ).

Attorney name and address to forward any legal correspondence to.

Name and contact of individual at Wells and XXXX  to forward all media inquires to.

I appreciate your assistance in helping to resolve this issue as quickly as possible. If there are any additional questions or request for documentation- please feel free to contact XXXX XXXX at XXXX or myself at XXXX."
2718,"Originally I had a dispute regarding mattresses that were never delivered. On XX/XX/2019 Welks Fargo applied a credit of {$1200.00}. When the merchant returned the funds, Wells Fargo applied an additional credit of {$1200.00} on XX/XX/2019. All ai see on my account was that I was extended credit over {$6500.00}. I spend some of it. Then on XX/XX/2019, Wells Fargo removes one of them stating they made an error. But I already spent on it. They then said I had an online cash advance of {$600.00}. I have no idea what that was, or how I would have gotten any cash from that transaction. If I wanted/needed cash I would have gone to an ATM to get cash in my hands. I did not request any online cash advance They then charged me an overlimit amount of {$750.00} and demanded I pay over {$900.00} as a minimum payment, which was well out of my budget. This adversely affected my credit. 

They have since refused to fix these issues and are now suing me for {$7700.00} and change."
2720,On XX/XX/2018 my bill did not go through when it was on auto-bill. I reached out to the company and they said that they saw the payment try to come out of the bank but it was rejected. They never notified me of the rejection and gave me this late payment. I now can not get a mortgage because of this mark on my credit and the company will not help me with this unfair situation.
2722,"I have had this card for 5 years and during that time paid it off multiple times. Wells Fargo has never lowered my interest rate and never offered me a promotional rate. They refuse to lower my rate and never give me a reason why. They keep telling me my account is reviewed periodically for promotional rates or to lower my rate, that is a lie! My account is never reviewed. My credit and history deserves a lower rate on this card."
2724,hello My name is XXXX XXXX ive reached out to wells fargo credit card several times and they claim they are going to fix the problem with my late payment from from XXXX to XXXX of 2020 since i was in the hospital with XXXX  and i was unemployed and fighting for my life before i got sick i was always on time with my payment im reaching out to you guys since wells fargo credit card is not taking action hopefully i can get this case resolved since ive paid the whole bill and then they closed my account after thank you. my email is XXXX XXXX
2726,"On several occasions Wells Fargo has fraudulently, lied to me and told me that I can not link my rewards cash back to my principal mortgage, which in turn has prevented me from earning cash back that would go towards my mortgage principal. Also, Wells Fargo has failed to attach my Visa credit card account to my online banking account so that I can not see what my bill is or make timely payments and have been charging me monthly {$27.00} or {$29.00} a month in late fees when they're not sending me a statement. I have an excellent credit score I pay my bills on time my mortgage has never been late with Wells Fargo Wells Fargo is extremely fraudulent and how they handle their customers. Please check into my mortgage Hamp modification where I was granted XXXX in equity and I believe my payments is not going towards my mortgage and my Principle as i was told it would be going towards."
2728,"In early XXXX, I noticed unauthorized charges on my Wells Fargo credit card. I called Wells Fargo and was told it would be looked into and adjustments would be made. Approximately 2 weeks later I saw that reduction of approximately {$600.00}. Had been made to bring credit card balance to approximately {$1.00}, XXXX. ( I 'm on a fixed income so as usual when I get paid once a month I pay my bills imediately so not to fall behind ) Well! I get a letter from Wells Fargo saying that "" because I had made my monthly payment '' Wells Fargo has reversed the non authorized charges and put the non authorized charges back on my Wells Fargo credit card for me to pay. So Wells fargo did not and does not want me to pay my monthly payment. saying : if I make my credit card payment I 'm to be penalized simply for paying my bill. ( When I paid my  bill the corrected amount was showing. So therefore it said $ payment was due on the adjusted {$1600.00} credit card balance. So now I 'm not going to pay Wells Fargo Credit Card - per Wells Fargo if I pay it it 's  validating the transactions that were not mine. That seem illegal - if I pay I 'm penalized, if I do n't pay my monthly payment I 'm penalized .... So it appears I am not to make my Wells Fargo credit card so I wo n't be penalized? Now my credit card info is all messed up they have made a mess of this and it was already adjusted to {$1600.00}. Not a single person said "" do n't make you monthly credit card payment or you will validate unauthorized charges and have to pay the unauthorized charges. I 'm so disgusted that Wells Fargo would do such a horrible thing to any customer - it 's shameful and Wells Fargo gets my XXXX check auto deposited."
2733,"On XX/XX/2021 I received an email from Wells Fargo letting me know they were closing my deposit account. I initially thought the email was spam, but I do have a credit card with Wells Fargo so on XX/XX/2021 I called to inquire as to what the email was in regards to. I was told that a deposit account was opened approximately the first part of XXXX and the fraud department flagged it, then decided to close it. Upon further investigation with Wells Fargo it was discovered that Wells Fargo had linked the fraudulent bank account to my credit card since the SS numbers matched. This fraudulent bank account was opened with the wrong information but since the SS numbers matched they linked them together. Wells Fargo put a hard hold on the checking account on XX/XX/2021 but also restricted my credit card so I was unable to use it and also unable to close the card and have a new one issued. After several days of trying to get to the correct department at Wells Fargo to get the restriction lifted on my credit card I was able to reach them on XX/XX/2021. I asked them to lift the restriction on the credit card, when they did, they also lifted the hard hold on fraudulent bank account since they were linked together. At that time I requested the credit card and fraudulent bank account be closed immediately. I was told if I closed the credit card with Wells Fargo I would not ever be eligible for credit with them in the future. That's perfectly fine with me, why would I? I spent in total over 6 hours on the phone with Wells Fargo trying to get this rectified. I have been told the card is cancelled and the fraud report can take up to 30 days to clear. They said I will receive notice by mail once all is settled. I have filed a police report as well froze my SS number and placed fraud alerts at all 3 credit reporting agencies."
2734,I have disputed this account and have reached out to the company/creditors MANY times but failed. This account is being reported inaccurately and incorrectly on my credit report.
2735,"I am XXXX years old and this is the first time I have ever had any financial problems with my account. I am an XXXX, a XXXX XXXX, and a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX.

I live in XXXX XXXX, CA, and because of my daughters condition I am rarely ten miles from home. 

It appears my credit card started being hacked on XX/XX/2020, with the thieves going to XXXX XXXX. Yes, credit card thieves took my card to XXXX. It sounds like a clich, but its true. They then proceeded to use my card in XXXX, XXXX  XXXX, XXXX, CA, and XXXX. CA, going to places that are more appropriate for a XXXX-year old than a XXXX-year-old. I dont eat fast food. I eat mostly organic.

My usual strategy has been to have a rough idea of what Ive charged, then paying $ XXXX on my credit card a month. 

I was shocked that Wells Fargo did not pick up the unusual activity, and when I realized there was a problem, I immediately contacted Wells Fargo and made a report on XX/XX/2020. The initial contact with Wells Fargo was great, but after that they acted in an unusual manner.

I have asked multiple time why this keeps happening and to no avail. Each time I am told that it was corrected and that they are proud of their work and assure me the problem has been corrected. Each month the same issue reoccurs. I have escalated this to be reviewed by Wells Fargo Executive Office complaint for review to zero satisfaction as they have not provided an answer for a single question I have as to why and they continue to be condescending and indignity. They have now created a case stating that I am not satisfied with their customer service to completely avoid answering the question as to why repeatedly I keep being forwarded to a customer service rep when making a telephonic payment. I have been passed around by the following people who tell me they are not the right person to speak. This run around has occurred for over 36 hours on the telephone. I was told that a ( XXXX ) had resolved my complaint, never spoke with anyone-complete fabrication ) and as of XX/XX/2018 the issue is still not resolved. 
I have had telephone contact with the following people in the Exec Office Complaint Review ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and lastly XXXX who was very condescending and passive aggressive and refused on 9 separate times to provide me with her supervisors name only stating that she reports to the Executive Office, and that by provide that as an answer she was responding to my question. ( very passive aggressive ) they provided fast talk, avoidance and no response to my question and when I stated that I would be filing with the CFPB I was informed that I should not be making threats. So I am immediately filing this complaint to follow through that it is not a threat only a promise to obtain a resolution to this issue that they refuse to provide.

In total I have spent 36 hrs to this point, just trying to get a satisfactory resolution, to no avail. I DO NOT WISH to have any of these listed Wells Fargo personnel to assist me as I can not afford the time or have the luxury to spend any more time on this matter which appears that is what they are hoping for..

2748,"I received a unsolicited letter from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2020, stating that they needed me to unfreeze my account with XXXX  to approve me for a credit card. I never applied for a credit card with Wells Fargo. 

I am very concerned that someone applied for a card using my name. 

When I called the number provided, it was very suspicious. They asked for my Social Security number and I said no. Then they practically hung up on me. I called back and asked for a supervisor and she wanted my birth date. Again, I said no and she said she couldn't help me. 

I then went to the Wells Fargo Bank website and called their customer service number. The entire automated system sounded very different. Unfortunately, I never could connect to a person. 

I suspect this is fraud and they are posing as Wells Fargo. I don't know what to do about this problem. I don't like the fact that they have my information and that someone started an application in my name. 

I also know there have been problems with Wells Fargo and credit cards in the past.

The Bank Manager 's name was XXXX at that time and whom I made the Initial Deposit to."
2753,I set up automatic payments and Wells Fargo continued to remove the automatic payments without my consent. This caused payments to become late until Wells Fargo decided to close account. They accepted payment for the balance despite letting me know that the account was closed. The amount was then returned back to me and sent to collections. I received a customer remediation check recently and feel that this is due to accounts being open/closed on my behalf without my consent.

XXXX removed it from my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX removed it sometime prior to XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX removed it on XX/XX/XXXX. I have received no further communication from Wells Fargo Bank on the matter. When I first reported the fraud to Wells Fargo Bank on XX/XX/XXXX, I spent approximately four hours being transferred to numerous departments, put on endless holds, and I was disconnected more than once. Not one representative seemed able or willing to help even though I am a victim of identity theft.

Instead Wells Fargo stated they could only extend assistance for a few months then everything would go back to normal. Meaning fees, interest, balance due. 
But covid made things worse. Wells Fargo didnt see it that way and closed my account within less than a year and reported me to credit bureus.

2769,"On XX/XX/19, a visit to XXXX store # XXXX was conducted (located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX). The intention of the visit was to inquire on and potentially obtain a prepaid XXXX cell phone plan that could be used for data purposes during a then-upcoming trip to XXXX. A data-only plan was needed (no texting/phone calls) as I would only require data for checking e-mails, using cellular GPS and basic web browsing for locating points of interests. This critical point was stressed to the store manager and fellow employee, who insisted and supposedly verified the ""XXXX XXXX"" plan would be ideal for my situation (data-only usage while in XXXX). It is worth mentioning I am a XXXX customer - however, the daily/monthly data plans offered by that network was not affordable in comparison to that supposedly offered by XXXX. Upon the promise that the aforementioned plan would work, a purchase of $XXXX was made, which included the prepaid month, SIM card and applicable taxes. The phone number assigned to me was XXXX XXXX; account number XXXX. The new line/account was successfully was activated, as instructed, stateside shortly after leaving the store. Upon landing in XXXX XXXX, XXXX (XXXX   airport), airplane mode was deactivated and numerous unsuccessful attempts to activate the phone/data service in XXXX were conducted. This was particularly concerning as I had relied on the data service to arrive at my destination from the airport. Thanks to preventive planning, a standalone GPS unit I had brought along with me on the trip guided me to my destination. Upon arriving, I immediately called XXXX's customer service number and much to my surprise, the customer service representative stated XXXX simply did not offer data service in XXXX, nor did it have contracts with local carriers/towers to provide said data service, which essentially rendered the entire purpose of purchasing the prepaid XXXX One plan useless. Shortly after returning to the U.S. (on XX/XX/XXXX), (2) visits were conducted to the XXXX store in question to request a refund based on the misinformation provided by the store manager, of all personnel. The requests were denied and Wells Fargo was then involved in the form of a dispute (on XX/XX/XXXX; dispute # XXXX). Wells Fargo initially refunded the entirety of the $XXXX while they investigated the matter, but were ultimately fairly clumsy and unhelpful in handling the matter (initially contacted the incorrect XXXX   store; case worker was unsure of what specific steps to take in the matter). During a 1+ hour 3-way call between myself, Wells Fargo and XXXX, a refund was apparently granted by a customer service representative, who admittedly claimed the store manager was misinformed. He communicated I should return to the store and instruct the manager to check the notes on the account in order to obtain the refund. Upon arriving to the store, the store manager (now surely acquainted with the dispute) refused to come to the main storeroom after being informed by an employee at the counter. Instead, he instructed his employee to advise a regional manager would be visiting the store within a few days and to return then for a refund. Begrudgingly, but as instructed, I requested time off from work and returned on a Friday at XXXX XXXX, only to have the same employee state the regional manager had not arrived and was unsure if or when he would be at the store. It was at this point I decided to document this matter to CFPB, as I appear to be out of viable options to obtain a refund on a service that was at minimum, ignorance on the part of the store manager - and at worst, a deliberate lie in order to obtain a new (albeit one-time) customer."

When I asked the Wells Fargo dispute representative if I have any appeal rights, the Wells Fargo dispute representative scoffed at me. After I was scoffed at I askd to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor told me to re send all of my dispute documents via email and Wells Fargo will take a second look at my dispute but that the two charges will remain on my account. It is my opinion that Wells Fargo did not do enough to protect my Visa rights. It is my opinion that Wells Fargo just wants to vacate my dispute doing as little work as possible. Nice right?

Through the years we would occasionally get offers for WF credit cards, which we would automatically dispose of. I recently contacted WF online and requested that I receive no further credit offers from them. They were happy to oblige, and confirmed that they had opted me out. I asked them a couple of days later if that opt-out request would automatically include my husband, as well. They said no, he would have to call or write to them in order for him to opt-out. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my husband wrote to the address they provided ; about a week later, his opt-out request was returned to us, marked 'box closed, not deliverable as addressed -- unable to forward ' ... ..we are both furious, as this is obviously a false address we were given, not to mention that my husband had enclosed his social security # and account # along with the request.

2816,On XX/XX/2018 i applied for a credit card with Wellsfargo on line and was told after completing application that i would have to wait until the next business day to find out if i was approved or not. Long story short they declined me until I demanded a manual review of the application with very great income and low DTI. After a review and several complaints about why i was turned down with a XXXX credit score my application was approved. I then asked about the initial application and the information that was in there was not accurate. The rep told me not to worry that it would not be processed and i wouldn't have to worry about it hitting my account. On XX/XX/2018 I notice charge on my account for {$6500.00} that was sent to XXXX Visa which is closed now. Wellsfargo said there was nothing they could do and I would have to see if XXXX Visa would return the funds due them not being able to reverse it. I explained that I did not Authorize this and that it must be a mistake due to the initial issues with the account opening. I tried contacting XXXX Visa to resolve issue and was told that they didn't receive or have any the of transfer to them. I returned to call Wellsfargo to relay the information 2 times after and nothing was done and my account now showed a balance of {$9900.00}. I only wrote a check to transfer a balance of {$3200.00} They have done nothing to correct the fraud but give me a new card number and transferred the unauthorized transaction my new card number and then reported the balance and usage to XXXX Credit Bureau that my utilization is at 100 % and the card balance is at {$9900.00}. I have called back again XX/XX/18 to talk to someone about it and now they are saying they will assign a case to it but will not correct information at the time for incorrect info on my credit report. Every time i call in I get told something different and they are not willing to help I have offered to pay the difference so that this would not affect my credit score or utilization and the representative told me not to worry that they would have this taken care of in a few days and if a balance did report it would only be for the amount I used which was {$3200.00} I also made a payment on the account of {$96.00} on XX/XX/18. I spoke with the customer service manager on XX/XX/18 that said that payment would be reversed back to me to not have the 1st payment being so much. I have gotten no where from calling for over 2 weeks now and as a result my credit score has been affected by this and I feel as if i have been discriminated against with this matter based off the history of the account and having issues with getting the application approved in the beginning. I would like to see that Wells fargo change their practices with customer service and doing things to customers accounts with out their approval and not wanting to correct it when recognized.

I have called their customer service, firstly they can not access my information from their side, as they can see only 6 months of account history, secondly since they can not see these charges they can not help me, gets frustrated and disconnects the phone. I have paid all my payments every month, despite of this Wells fargo has accumulated the late fees charge as {$100.00}. This is poor processing and backend issues on the banking and payments side which I can not do anything about. Despite complaining, this is going to deaf ears and I have no forum where I can report this misappropriation of system issues to consumer. This is very unprofessional of Wells Fargo."

When I asked them to verify that nothing else was opened up in my name, they wanted to verify additional information on me. I called them and had already established my identity - enough for them to cancel the card. I asked what other steps would be taken in this matter - as far as an investigation, credit reporting, but was told that their responsibility ended with closing the account - that is not good enough. Wells Fargo should be going above and beyond in handling customer privacy, especially with all of the recent scandals and missteps they have made.

I had a legitimate bill from the Hotel for {$980.00}. However, they also charged me {$1000.00} for the hotel stay of another conference guest that I have never met or heard of. I know the details of the fraudulent purchase because Wells Fargo reported that to me during their investigation. The hotel would not tell me who the person was who made the purchase. The hotel claims they have an authorization from me for that guest to use my card, which is absolutely untrue. I have seen the documents presented to my card issuer ( Wells Fargo ), and it was merely a receipt for which my card info was used. There is no signature of any kind to accompany the card info, or any kind of form that would give my purchasing power to another person. I was in physical possession of the card the entire time. 

Wells Fargo is not willing to overturn the fraudulent charge in my favor, but there is absolutely no legitimate reason for that decision.

I had just finished paying off credit card with a XXXX credit limit. I was a good customer and even took a consumer loan to finance kitchen remodel.

That is ridiculous since the account was just opened in XXXX and I have not even been 30days yet on a single payment. On my call at XXXX EST, the supervisor on that call stated he would have the team he thought could help "" online banking '' return my call in 48hrs. I provided permission to have the department call me back and leave a message if required. I have yet to receive a response. I have had other accounts with Wells Fargo ( 2 mortgage accounts that are now closed ) but have not had any issue creating a profile for either accounts. In the early XXXX 's, I had a Wells Fargo fraud issue, where they had another customer assigned to my social security number not sure if they ever cleared up the issue on their end.

That banker and his supervisor both refused to proceed with the request in a clear retaliation and blacklisting of Mr. XXXX  Information continues by this mafia type of practices of Wells Fargo Bank N.A.

He knew that he had not completed the repairs that he was paid for and in order for us to receive the keys to the vehicle as stated in the police report I have. The officer told us that if we wanted our vehicle we needed to sign the receipt. We asked the mechanic if we could test drive the vehicle to make sure it was operable and ready to drive on the highway. We were denied this request, after two hours of going back and forth with the officers and the mechanic my uncle agreed to sign just so that we could get his car back. We were under extreme duress during these circumstances and were trying to make it to a funeral that morning. 
Two hours later after receiving the vehicle back the transmission started to leak profusely and we had to pull over putting lives in danger including ourselves. We called the mechanic to let him know the problem he came out and checked the issue. He told us that he never touched the transmission and it would be an additional XXXX . We went and got a second opinion and had the repairs done at XXXX XXXX XXXX. The total cost for repairs XXXX to repair transmission and replace the seal that connects the engine to the transmission. 
The mechanic from XXXX XXXX stated via text message that he didn't have to touch the transmission to install the engine which is incorrect. In order to remove the engine the seal on the transmission needs to be removed and replaced to alleviate any leakage that can arise from old seal. Basically the mechanic did unfavorable repairs costing my uncle more money even though he said the repairs were complete. The check engine light is on in the vehicle. The split payments were made as follows XXXX $ in cash and XXXX $ via cash app. The mechanic told us that he would not accept money order or check or even visa debit. 
He stated that he only wanted cash or cash app in order to retrieve the vehicle. This mechanic is untrustworthy and should have his business operating license revoke indefinitely .I 've sent over several supporting documents to Wells Fargo only to be told its not enough. We work very hard for our money and transactions should be able to be disputed with our banks if they are fraudulent. FDIC insured should cover all complaints not just some. I don't want this to happen to anyone else. I've talked to several people who have had similar complaints resolved with their banks but not with Wells Fargo disputing center. 
In closing Id like to say people put their money in banks for security. If I cant find security and comfort in my banking institution I might as well open up a credit union or carry cash or money order at least I know that my money is safe and can be recovered if anything fraudulent happens."

He later said that he would submit a request and if it got approved then I would receive the letter in the mail explaining the error, and if it didn't get approved then I wouldn't be receiving a letter explaining what happened on my account. It is not fair for them to handle this matter so carelessly."
2860,"I filled out an online application for a Wells Fargo credit card on XX/XX/2018 and received a letter dated XX/XX/2018 denying my credit approval on the basis of Not a permanent United States resident. I've been in the United States for approximately 15 years, I have a SSN and have had several credit cards in the past, I even have a current bank account with Wells Fargo. I'm originally from XXXX, but I am a permanent resident of the United States and have gone through the proper channels to obtain my permanent resident card. I believe the reason they denied my application is discriminatory and violates the National Origin category of the ECOA."
2862,"I fell behind on my XXXX/Wells Fargo Credit Card. I called several times to see what my options were for repayment. I called in XXXX to set up a payment plan, in which I did. I spoke to XXXX and she set me up on a plan for {$100.00} a month until XX/XX/XXXX and then {$38.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. This would pay my bill in full and close my account out.

Recently, I received a notice that my credit report is showing this account as charged off. I have not received ONE piece of mail or ONE phone call to say that this was the case. I called XXXX/Wells Fargo Credit Card on XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX, she said that they can at their own discretion at any time "" six or seven months '' late and file it as a charge off. She also said the only reason they would remove the charge off status was if it was a bank error. Then, XXXX got on the phone and proceeded to tell me that she has me on a recorded phone call saying that I knew that this was a charge off. This never happened. She said she was going to transfer me to a Executive Office and hung up on me. I have paid all of this bill from the first payment as I said I would. This is ridiculous."

2867,"I was divorced XX/XX/XXXX. My ex-wife lives at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, WI XXXX. I moved to XXXX XXXX  years ago and am a full-time resident here in XXXX, XXXX. I have not returned to Wisconsin since moving here even for a visit. My daughter, XXXX XXXX XXXX, is my contact person in the US for banking, investment and mail forwarding information. On XX/XX/XXXX, my ex-wife received correspondence from Wells Fargo Card Services addressed to XXXX XXXX at her address welcoming me to their credit card family. A copy of the letter is attached. Included in the envelope was a credit card stating to call to open the account for use. My ex-wife gave the material to my daughter who emailed me in XXXX asking what it was all about. I told her that I did not open any account with Wells Fargo and for her to shred the credit card which she did ( email attached ). My Social Security number was on the documentation but the name was not the name I use for ANY purposes. I use XXXX XXXX XXXX or my full name XXXX XXXX XXXX - NEVER simply XXXX XXXX. I called Wells Fargo and was directed to the XXXX XXXX to a research and remediation analyst and explained this fraudulent issue. After some weeks, Wells Fargo sent me a letter ( copy attached ) stating they found no fraud had occurred and that the credit card was activated ( which it was not - it was shredded ). Further correspondence from Wells Fargo was very confusing in that they referred to TWO different accounts - one ending in XXXX and another ending in XXXX. They have failed to explain the two different accounts. One refers to a balance of {$5000.00} ( even though I was told that the card had a {$4500.00} limit ). By the end of XXXX, XXXX, I received a resolution letter from Wells Fargo, picture attached, stating that it was authorized by me and the case is closed! An identity Theft Report was filed with the Federal Trade Commission on XX/XX/XXXX. I followed all their list of things to do including letters to parties involved, contact credit bureaus, ordered a XXXX report. On my credit report from XXXX, on the third page, I noticed someone has been paying the monthly balance. I have never sent any payment to Wells Fargo. A copy of the pages from XXXX  are attached. In addition to the fraudulent Wells Fargo credit card ( s ), my ex-wife received correspondence from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which was an IRS Form 1099-INT statement in my name ( XXXX XXXX ) sent to the XXXX XXXX, WI address. I included this information in the FTC report and called XXXX XXXX. They researched this investment account and promptly closed it and froze the information included. They apologized for this and realized it was fraud - but not Wells Fargo who insists it is MY account that I took out which is physically impossible with me living in XXXX! And it is not even my full name that I always use."
2869,"In XX/XX/XXXX, we had received a promotional offer from Wells Fargo on our email as we are customers. The offer was for a Balance Transfer with these terms : 15 months interest free ( 0 % ), for a 5 % fee. 
We have kept the email with the offer. We called on XX/XX/XXXX, and requested this offer. On XX/XX/XXXX, we noticed that we were being charged interest on this transfer. We called Wells Fargo and talked to Supervisor XXXX. He looked into it and said the request had been improperly processed as a Cash Advance. He told us that he would submit it for correction. He said to give them a few months and we would see the correction made. Meanwhile, he advised us to make minimum payments until it was corrected. We waited until XX/XX/XXXX and called back because nothing had been done. We talked to XXXX, who said it was a 'bucket change '. He switched us to XXXX in Customer Care. Then we were switched to XXXX, who said the Case Manager, XXXX would call us within 24 hours. We received no call. We called back XX/XX/XXXX and were told that XXXX had tried to call, but our line was busy. Our call history showed no missed call. We were told that XXXX would contact us when it was resolved. It has been six months, and we feel they are not going to help us. Meanwhile they are charging us interest as if it is a Cash Advance at 23.99 %."
2870,"I applied for a credit card with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. I didn't receive an immediate decision and received an e-mail on XX/XX/XXXX stating I was denied due to no bank cards open in the past 6 months. I called Wells Fargo because that made no sense because I closed my XXXX XXXX  card on XX/XX/XXXX, which I've had for quite some time and still had an open balance on. I applied for the WF CC so I could do a balance transfer. 

I called WF and asked if I were to get a denial letter also in the mail. ( Once I received the denial letter it said no open bank cards and no open bank cards in the past 6 months ). I also called XXXX  as that is who they use and confirmed my XXXX account was reflecting ( I have the paper copy now ). I explained to WF I have perfect credit ( no missed payments ) and have a long credit history ( I am XXXX ). I've previously had car notes, a mortgage, and a number of credit cards. I only have one card with a balance and that is my XXXX XXXX.My XXXX  credit score is currently reflecting as XXXX. When I had a home loan it was over 800. WF opened an executive complaint and I was given the case number and told to expect a resolution by XX/XX/XXXX. On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX I received an e-mail they needed more time to review my issue and to give them until XX/XX/XXXX. I called on XX/XX/XXXX but they couldn't do anything. On XX/XX/XXXX nothing had been resolved and I had received no communications so I called again. The man I spoke with said the person 's name handling my complaint was XXXX. I also had XXXX 's number and left a message to call me today and I have not heard anything and it's now the XXXX. 

Someone needs to seriously look into WF practices in regards to fairness in credit card applications. I have worked my whole life to maintain outstanding credit and I really don't appreciate the way I've been treated."
2876,"Wells Fargo Bank follows a policy of making it difficult to contact them, forcing waits often of an hour and more. 
A web search reveled that this is a widely embraced policy. Suites such as XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX have been developed to deal with this problem. None of them work for me. In particular they provide no way to contact the group one needs to talk to, directly, at XXXX. Instead one has to be transferred to a call center, which obviates XXXX procedure of calling on ones behalf so one does not have to wait interminably on hold. 
I had requested a stop payment to XXXX XXXX XXXX ( I am XXXX ) on Sunday XX/XX/11 and was told to call back on Monday to provide reasons why. The phone never answered. This means the stop payment will go through without XXXX being advised why. I depend on their home delivery service. Usually I have been treated well, but both XXXX and Wells Fargo have blocked my attempt to reach someone at XXXX to resolve the issue."

2879,"This is in regards to a BusinessLine Mastercard with Wells Fargo.I had an  outstanding balance with favorable interest rates ( adjustable based on some index ) that had no expiry date ; it was offered to me more perhaps close to 10 years ago. Because I had a large amount of unused credit, last year the bank offered 3.99 % for 12 months. I called in to ask if payments would be applied to the balance with lower interest rate ( which I wanted because it has an expiry date ) and was told yes. However, in reality that is not the case. Some amounts were applied to the lower interest rates but some to the higher one. When I called in to request that all of the payment ( after interest and bank fees ) to be applied to the lower interest rates ( which has upcoming expiry date ), I was  told that that's not possible because they "" can not make adjustments ''. When I asked why the payment was not applied to the lower interest rates as I was told, the reply was that that's the general practice but not always and I was referred to some fine prints that says the bank can decide how to apply payments. Most of the phone reps didn't even know about this fine print. I talked to three different phone reps and when I said payment was not applied to lower interest rates, they all initially seemed to think that their computer made a mistake!"

XXXX, XXXX and XXXX All disputes were opened at the same time, all for the same reason and all from the same company XXXX  who used several different names and URLs to run a fraudulent business. 

Dispute Transaction ID XXXX from XXXX XXXX for {$7500.00} was closed in my favor but Disputes XXXX from XXXX for {$7500.00} and Dispute Transaction ID XXXX from XXXX also for {$7500.00} were closed for partial credit on my account because of the merchants response. 

Upon further review of the letter sent to you by the merchant it is hard to believe it has been used against my dispute cases. I am asking that the merchant letter be dismissed from both dispute cases for the many reasons I am going to list below in addition the attachments I am sending you offering proof of my claims. 

Even just a quick visual analysis of the contents of the document supposedly delivered by the merchant reveals numerous elements. 

1. The document was not composed upon the merchants logo-bearing stationary.

2. The document possesses no date specifying when the document was composed.

3. The document possesses no address identifying from where the document was mailed. 

4. The document possesses no telephone number to be used as evidence that the document was faxed rather than mailed to the dispute center.

5. The document possesses no name indicating the identity of who composed the document.

6. The document possesses such poor and flawed wording as to be unintelligible overall and certainly paints a clear picture that the document was not composed and released by any genuine merchant. For, if the document had been composed and released by any genuine merchant, the writing would be professional, error-free, and easily readable. 

7. The documents verbiage contains the wrong date regarding when my association with the merchant began. If the document were legitimate, the accurate date of when my association with the merchant began would have been utilized. -See attachment for proof of incorrect date and even year. 

8. The existence of a document-building computer-systems database node number in place just above the leftward region of the documents first paragraph.

Being such a large company and dealing with a higher tiered dispute specialist, XXXX XXXX I am surprised that this bogus merchant letter has been used against my case and further more believe that the disputed amounts should be closed in my favor. 

Please see attached proof that the date of services is incorrect and also that the services purchased have not been received or delivered as guaranteed. I will reattach also the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Page 1 that states in Section One, Event and Product Highlights that Lifetime Access to the program was in the Agreement.

2887,"On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I called the Wells Fargo customer service XXXX XXXX ) to request a credit card limit increase, for card ending XXXX. XXXX, the bank rep, asked for three things : Stated income, debts and consent for credit inquiry. I had no problem with giving any of the information, except for the hard credit report inquiry. I requested a "" SOFT '' inquiry instead and she stated she could not move forward with the limit increase until I consented to a hard inquiry. I requested to speak to a consumer complaint rep. 

XXXX, in customer relations, couldn't help either. He said the only way to increase my credit limit was by a hard inquiry, which appears, not, to be a true statement. He may not know it. 

I don't want to use the word lightly and accuse Wells Fargo of any type of discrimination, however, it seems inconsistent and some-what skeptical that after having a credit card since XXXX ( and a bank account for over XXXX yrs ) I have had the same limit of {$4600.00} since receiving the card. It's insulting! Especially so, when I have other card limits over $ XXXX, with other financial organizations. 
I know for a fact, of several family members who have received a credit increase without making a request. My husband received a generous automatic increase, that left him suspicious enough to verify its legitimacy with the bank. So, I know increases are made without a hard inquiry, or a consumer 's inquiry. My willingness to give consent for a SOFT inquiry is more than most. and my option to stay with WF bank for some long should come with more rewards than grief."

A couple of weeks later in  XXXX   XXXX  a credit card shows up at my door step. I specifically did not ask/want the credit card. I activated it a couple of weeks later. I called them  XXXX   XXXX  and asked where the card came from, no good response. I called them  XXXX   XXXX , after the whole banking scandal, no good response.     I then checked my credit report  XXXX   XXXX  and saw that that they did a hard credit pull on my account for that credit card. I called them and told them I did not authorize it and they did not tell me they did a hard pull on the account.  XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  I talked to one of their customer service reps and the guy said if you cancel the card we can send a letter to the credit bureaus and retract the credit pull. I said fair deal.

'' Well they 're not removing the credit pull, I closed the card, and I lost the points I accumulated.     Basically, it 's the worst customer service I 've ever had and least amount of answers to my questions. I 've NEVER, EVER had a credit card or bank account for less than a year from opening.

After I paid the taxes I took {$5000.00} cash to the bank to pay the card off off. I continued to receive statements stating I owed this money after it was paid off. I contacted Wells Fargo with this complaint and was told they could not go this far back and tell me what the charges were from years earlier and this was because the card already paid off. So I have paid this money off that was already paid in cash. Unfortunately at the time, I didn't have time to dispute as I would have normally done and didn't want anything on my credit so I just paid it. We have been doing business since the XXXX days and I have never been so disappointed and is actively looking for someone else to take over our business accounts. This company gets more disappointing yearly with fraud and abuse. Although, I feel this will still never be addressed as previously at least I have made the company aware."

I wasnt the one asking to close this account, but wells fargo is seeing to mark in my report that i was. Also making 2 of my payment as 30-60 days late while showing the account as closed. im upset at the fact that i got this account to help with my credit while believing in the fact it wouldve gotten a graduation to a insecure account."

I want this hard inquiry removed as I did not apply for credit with them. REMOVE from all 3 bureaus.

I ONLY knew of this issue because XXXX XXXX told me they pulled and I was sent a denial letter when I never applied."

I do not like being on the phone and having to always ask for conversation to be repeated, it makes me feel troublesome and I am always having to apologize. Also, conversation can be misunderstood. Yet Wells Fargo continues attempt calling me. I want a accurate record of all correspondence, Therefore I am requesting a CEASE and DESIST of all phone conversations. Wells Fargo may reach me at my email address, by USPS or through there messaging platform. 
There is nothing in the contract they created and asked me to agree to that states certain correspondence can only be done over the phone. 
CEASE and DESIST all phone conversations particularly from their Executive Office, immediately, Stop harassing me!"
2908,"Back in XX/XX/XXXX I was approved for Home Project Credit Card to complete a major project in my home from a lending institution. In XX/XX/XXXX I paid off the balance on the card. 

I attempted to you this card his morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ) only to discover that due to inactivity the lending institution closed the account in XX/XX/XXXX unbeknown to me. 

The same institution had some racket going on, that prompted me to give them a call back in XX/XX/XXXX I was informed at that time, that their system only showed two ( 2 ) accounts for me. 
I am disappointed that I was misinformed at the detriment of my Credit Score being affected. I strongly feel that I should have been advised at that time that the card had been closed. As a matter of fact I should have been made of the pending clousure of the account. Which could have provided me an opportunity to curtail this dilemma. 

My main concern here is my CREDIT SCORE. I should not have to suffer this setback if a lending institution decided to close its doors to me. If it was the other way around I could understand. I was at a place where I didnt need to use it so, I DIDNT ; now I need it and its not AVAILABLE!!"

Wells Fargo contacted me on XX/XX/2019 to say that medical services can not be disputed. They disconnected before I could explain that this was elective not medical and that I was disputing the fact that I did not receive the service expected. Clearly Wells Fargo did not know how to handle this type of dispute.

I used two separate accounts to pay for the service. XXXX had no issues with returning the funds due to the dispute."
2911,"I have a Wells Fargo Propel card with statements closing on the XXXX of each month. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I have noticed that my statement has closed and made required payment ( XXXX dollars with XXXX minimum due ). 
XX/XX/XXXX statement shows payment in transactions - yet still marks account with no payment received and assess XXXX late fee. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I call CS to fix the issue and told that I have made payment "" too soon '' -  even though it is clearly some sort of the system issue on WF side. 
No apology was offered and no assurance that my credit is not damaged - even though account was marked as 30 days delinquent - as my direct request to submit corrected info to credit bureau seems to be ignored."
2912,"I am very unhappy with Wells Fargo service, in ALL departments. I tried Wells Fargo a few times, but all end up badly. 

Firstly trying Wells Fargo back in XXXX with mortgage, end up with very bad experience - spent time for the mortgage, paid all the fees, and DID NOT get the house at the end.

Second time was opening a bank account with Wells just to help my bank friend to hit aggressive goal few years ago ( before it was getting to the news and being fined because of the fake-account scandal ) - again, bad experience. 

And this time, try again with Wells Fargo credit card last year. Called Wells Fargo today to get a replacement credit card, was told my credit card account was closed for no reason by Wells Fargo. 
All credit card reward associated with the credit card account are gone as well and the rep told me there is no way to retrieve without reopening the same credit card account. When I open the card, it did not state that the bank will close your card anytime without giving you a chance to redeem your point! 

Wells Fargo Internet banking is really outdated and it is super hard to rest the password without having the actual card - unable to reset password via email or text message associated with my Wells Fargo profile in XXXX. I was unable to check my statement or doing anything using internet banking and this is the only way I do my banking. 

The only thing I hope now is getting my reward back, and I hope Wells Fargo can get this right this time. Please contact me via email or call XXXX if there is any question."
2913,"I lost my physical "" XXXX  '' credit card with Wells Fargo ( WF ) in early XXXX. I rarely used the physical card because it was registered with XXXX XXXX. 

I received a notification of possible fraud from WF about {$300.00} spent at a XXXX in XXXX XXXX. I have been to XXXX  several times, but only nearby ones ( XXXX  XXXX  and XXXX XXXX )- why would I go to a XXXX  in XXXX XXXX when there is a XXXX  right next to my house? Also, I don't believe I would do big purchases at XXXX ; I use XXXX and XXXX which has rewards and better prices. 

I called WF about the fraudulent charge. I said that my card was probably lost but I wasn't exactly sure. I had just gotten back from a vacation in XXXX and was still unpacking and short on rest, so I couldn't say definitively. WF gave some unclear response about sending a new card and reversing the charge. But it didn't turn up anywhere in the weeks after that- it was lost. 

I assumed they would be sending me a new card. But for a while I didn't check my mail because I came down with XXXX, and afterwards I sort of forgot since I rarely used the physical card and assumed that the fraud charge was reversed ( it had been, temporarily, then ) I assume they didn't send me a new card because I was still using the card through XXXX  XXXX  and for rent rewards points. But I didn't have the physical card and it turned out they were not intending on sending a replacement for the lost physical card. 

Now I see the fraudulent {$300.00} has been added back to my balance. I contacted them about receiving a new physical card, and they will send one, but it seems like they will be dragging their feet in resolving this claim and having me waste my {$300.00}."
2915,I have paid off my Wells Fargo credit card over four times since XX/XX/2019. In total Ive paid them over {$66000.00} in these 8 months.

I have been talk to very rudely due to an error on my part when I made my payment in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX I made it through my app on my phone. When I went to make the payment last month it already had XXXX XXXX on my account so I chose that option to make a payment. A couple days had past after I made the payment and I was checking both of my apps to make sure the payment went through. I havent ever been late on any credit or bill my whole life and if you pull my credit or look at my card history you can see that. I notice it didnt go through and called XXXX XXXX to see why they advised me that I used my Savings account with them and thats why it didnt process but I did not know that was the type of account on the options of my Wells Fargo app I thought it was my checking but it was already there so once I realized I quickly went to my Wells Fargo app and updated XXXX XXXX to the checking account and my payment came out. I do apologize it was not done on purpose it was an honest error so I technically was not late I had the money just didnt know it was XXXX XXXX Saving account on the Wells Fargo app for the select payment because it was already there. When I made the payment on XX/XX/XXXX I was already the checking account on file on my Wells Fargo app for XXXX XXXX so it went through with no problem. I called to see why my available credit was {$0.00} because I made a payment and it should be an available credit but when I called in I was spoke to really rudely as if I was really late without them asking what really happen they advised me it was an hold on my available credit. I finally did a complaint several with the executive department because some agents did not want to help or listen state I should read my terms and conditions and things like that. One executive agent advised that she reach out to the department that releases the available credit and they told her they will email me so I can send a screenshot that my payment went through XXXX XXXX and in a 2-3 couple hours I will she my available credit I did exactly that and screenshot it and my available credit is still {$0.00}. I called in Saturday and was talk to very rudely again but than I did another complaint and talk to someone else in the executive department after I had to hang up on the previous agent for not trying to help and listen to me at all but she advised me the department that releases the funds was closed on the weekend the agent after I hung up on the other agent. Im about to pay this card completely off in 30-60 days I just needed my credit for an emergency. Im XXXX and Im XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX a year ago back to back I dont need the stress I need help and someone to listen. I made an honest error and get treated this way.

I wasn't able to refinance on time but was making maximum payments and from over {$5000.00} the balance went down to {$2700.00} and I was able to refinance, when I called to pay the remaining balance I was told that my interest just kicked in and from XXXX the balance when back up to {$4800.00}. Wellsfargo refused any negotiation to bring the balance down. 
I paid the balance down again to XXXX. and when loan closed and tittle company sent the payment Wellsfargo stated that now my balance was back up to {$4100.00} due to interest charged. Wellsfargo stated that I still owe {$130.00} after long conversation Wellsfargo agreed to bring the bill  XXXX and close the count ( that happened in XX/XX/18 ).

I called again around the end of XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX and requested that wellsfargo follow are agreement bring the count XXXX  and close it. after 1hr conversation between different people and finally a supervisor they agreed to close the count at XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I received another bill from Wellsfargo for {$100.00} to be paid. I called and asked why this count still generated fees has from my last conversation we agreed that the count was XXXX and closed. The customer service I was speaking to stated that they just credit the late fees and the balance of {$64.00} unpaid generated another fee which is why it's XXXX But the count is close. So I said "" Can I please speak to a supervisor, because I will not close the count if there was any balance that don't make sense to me. What I remember is that after we brought the count XXXX  he was supposed to be closed ''. Customer service said Ok, went and come back telling me that actually my last conversation was XX/XX/XXXX and I was still owe this balance. I told her that she just told me 5 minute ago something different that was in her computer and that she stated that the count was been closed. I was upset and asked her how she can lied like this in my face. When supervisor come I can her sarcasm in his voice. He was noshes insisting on the last statement of the customer services. I was very upset because this card was a reap-oof for me and they still trying to squeeze out me anything they can. 
I was paying the bill from my Wellsfargo online billing. their system always was confused using my joint count that doesn't have any payment set. charges my individual and joint alternatively, and always charging me late fees when I wasn't late. All wanted is to paid this balance and I did, but they won't let me be debt free from them."
2924,"In late 2018 I was traveling on holiday. My wallet was stolen and my primary Credit Cards were taken. As such I had to use my Wells Fargo Credit Card, which i rarely use due to the rate and the service. When I received my XXXX statement, i was shocked to see i was XXXX over my limit. I was also shocked to see I had missed a payment. When I called the bank, the banker informed me my statements were now being sent electronically. I did not request electronic statements and rely on the paper statement as a way to make payments. This has happened many times over the years. 

While Wells allowed me to transact - i was required to make the full payment. I am fortunate that I have the reserves to pay a huge one time payment. I know most consumer can't cover a {$400.00} unexpected expense. I asked why they continued to approve my purchases, why they never sent me text messages I had enrolled in, and why they never tried to contact me about being past due. The response was "" because you are a good customer ''. I of course immediately paid the full amount due over the phone. But when it came to helping me as a customer, the answer was basically "" no ''. 

Wells Fargo can/does send me daily emails on marketing materials, and does send me alerts of every fashion on my other accounts. I don't understand why they would allow this to occur and give no recourse to the situation. They refused to refund the late fee, ( I have never had a late payment in the last 20 years ), they reported the late payment to the credit reporting agency. I asked them politely to correct the reporting and they said no. They required I make a XXXX payment immediately or risk further damage to my credit score. This seems very deceptive and unfair. As I stated, I am lucky i can afford to resolve and that i have perfect credit - but what happens to most consumers in this situation? 

I called today to close all of my accounts. I currently have a mortgage, personal loan, personal line of credit, a credit card, two checking accounts and a savings account. I was directed to go "" talk to a branch '' and see what they could do. 

I think the practice of allowing a customer to go grossly over their limit - just to report it as a negative on their credit report and create a very large payment due is unfair. They have many ways to contact me and choose not too, and should have simply declined my card purchases. This treatment has created fee income and adversely impacted my good credit."
2925,"Wells Fargo is involved in fraudulent bank practices again. There was a misunderstanding with the city of XXXX as I opted for installment payments but a legal order was placed on my account, which I got it rectified with the city of XXXX on XX/XX/18 but Wells Fargo charged me a legal order processing fee of {$120.00}. I believe this to be a ripoff. I was never made aware of such a fee and I called to have it reversed and was told that it was in small print on page 46 of a supposed booklet or packet I received when I first signed up. I have had Wells Fargo for years and this is an outright scam. The lady on the phone said she could give me a partial refund but I want a full refund of my {$120.00}. Very dishonest banking practice. I will be closing my account and never banking with Wells Fargo again. I will also notify and warn other users on my social media and family and friends to beware of Wells Fargo."
2926,"I applied for credit card and was asked if I wished to do a promotional balance transfer prior to submitting application. I accepted and put the amount to pay off credit card balance, upon submitting application I was only approved for a lower amount in which I had no interest in accepting. I called company and stated I didn't want their offer within 24 hours. It's now 10 days or more later and I receive letter stating of a balance transfer for XXXX dollars and a fee added to it, I never authorized a balance transfer for XXXX dollars and a extra fee. The card they sent it to is now in a negative balance because I paid the card off myself. I still to this day don't have a credit card from this company and they also decided to do a balance transfer for a amount I never approved of. I called them today XX/XX/2019 and was told they're allowed to do whatever they want and charge me for it. It's also my responsibility to get them their money back according to them. Any help resolving this problem would be greatly appreciated. The letter states the last 4 digits of account is XXXX, wells fargo, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX IA, XXXX.

2929,"I claimed Fraud on My Credit Card with Wells Fargo on purchases in XX/XX/2020. 

Wells Fargo Issued a new card but never arrived to my address. 

On that new card there was a XXXX  charge for XXXX and XX/XX/2020. 

I claimed Fraud on those XXXX  charges and told wells fargo to shut down my account in XX/XX/2020. 

I have been unable to close the card and have contacted wells fargo In 3-4 times and have been promised it would be closed and the fraud balance would be taken care of. I have spoke with Disputes, Fraud, Collections and Card Services and they have all told me that they would take card of it but it still hasnt happened. 



My Credit Card is XXXX and I need support with closing my Wells Fargo Credit Card for good."
2930,"Consumer has a credit card with Wells Fargo Bank. 
Consumer used a promotional interest rate of 3.99 % which was suppose to expire in XX/XX/2019.It was solicited by Wells Fargo Bank Consumer has been making all payments on-time. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, Consumer did not receive a billing statement. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, anticipating that a payment is due, consumer still made a higher than anticipated payment which arrived at the bank just two business days late or four days if weekend is in included. 
As a result, bank charged the consumer a late payment fee of {$39.00} on XX/XX/19 statement. 
As a result, bank removed the promotional rate and started to charge a penalty rate of 12.25 %. 

Consumer monthly minimum payment went up from {$750.00} to {$1100.00}. 
Consumer is being forced to pay an interest rate charge per month of {$560.00} instead of {$180.00} thus costing almost {$380.00} additional in interest charges per month until XX/XX/2019. 

Consumer believes that Wells Fargo change in interest rate is a predatory lending practice and is in violation of consumer federal protection act and other federally granted consumer rights. This complaint is not an isolated issue. This bank has history of fraudulent business practices and has been on the news more than any other bank. 

Consumer hereby requests that 48 business hour delayed payment does not constitute a breach of contract to remove a promotional rate from the account. Hence this issues should be resolved by re-implementing the 3.99 % interest rate, returning {$39.00} late payment fee. 

Consumer also request that bank changes its promotional offers, be more transparent regarding its penalty rate. No one has an idea if they miss the payment by one hour or 96 hours are likely to incur penalty interest rate. Bank needs to define that payment needs to be missed one or two billing cycles. This period can not be in hours. This is fraud and abuse. 

Consumer intends to fight this charge through all available channels if this issue is not solved. My concern is how many others are in the same shape when as a physician and with business degrees, I am a savy borrower who has NEVER missed a payment for over two decades. 

I can be reached via XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"
2931,"I complaint is the following against Wells Fargo 's response to this federal agency and to me. 

One : In the response, Wells Fargo mentions that it waived the interest charge. This was only done because it told the supervisor on the XXXX that I believed the account to be closed. He then waived the charge and proceeded to close the account. Wells Fargo makes it look like it was a charity and good will on their part. The whole story needs to be explained. 

Two : The author of the report did not listen to the entire call. This is a very important disclosure that should have been mentioned and reported in the report. This above fact in all honesty negates the report and incomplete and in accurate. 

Three : The report states that they representative told me that their was a request on th XXXX for the closure. Again not the whole story. The fact is that I called Wells Fargo mad as XXXX that the account was still not closed several days later. I was assured by the supervisor that the account was to be closed later that day. I was mad because the two requests did not happen. This is not in the report. I brought up the fact that I made the request for this account to be closed not once but twice not the Wells Fargo employees. 

Four : The lady in the executive office told me several times that they account was not closed in fact it was still open. She then went on to ask me if I still wanted the account open. This statement would not be made if she was aware of any closure requests because that would be a red flag to do more research to make sure that account was in progress to be closed. She further went on to ask if I wanted a replacement card and a new pin number. I told her that I wanted to account to remain open, but I thought that since I made the account to be closed request that it could not be reopened per Wells Fargo 's own policy. She assured me that it was open and their was nothing there to stop me from getting a replacement card and that I should receive that replacement card later. These facts are not in the report any where. 

Five ; Why are these people making misleading statements to a federal agency still employed by Wells Fargo? 

Six : Why are their 10 different letters from Wells Fargo employees on this complaint that states 10 different opinions? 

Seven : Why is not one employee and one department working on this complaint? 

Eight : The confusion about this complaint is not mine but on the shoulders of Wells Fargo. 



Thanks XXXX XXXX"

2941,"I called Wells Fargo to dispute a charge on my credit card, but was forced to close my account and open a new card. I explained that I had already contacted the merchant XXXX times about the erroneous charge and they acknowledged and promised to refund both times ; I reached out to Wells Fargo because I still did not get the promised refund after a month. I explained that it appeared to be a bad business practice on behalf of the merchant ( XXXX ), but the Wells Fargo rep insisted that the account had to be closed due to fraud even though there were no other questionable charges and the merchant acknowledged the erroneous charge. I did not feel comfortable closing my account but the rep said that was the only way I would not be held liable for the charge. I simply wanted to file a dispute for the charge and get it reversed, since the merchant did not follow through on their promise to. 

The charge in question was submitted by XXXX and posted on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$34.00}. I contacted XXXX directly on XX/XX/XXXX ( the day I received a text notification of the pending charge ) and again on XX/XX/XXXX. Both times, XXXX claimed the refund would post to my credit card in XXXX days. That never happened, so I contacted Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX to file a dispute on the charge. I spoke to "" XXXX '' who transferred me to Claims ; then I spoke to "" XXXX '' who transferred me to the Credit Card Dept. ; then I spoke to XXXX, who closed the card due to "" fraud ''. XXXX said she was required to close the card and issue a new account- and that I would receive a new card within about 7 days. I kept informing her that I did not believe it was fraud but merely poor business practices on behalf of XXXX. I explained that I have an active XXXX account, XXXX acknowledged the erroneous charge, and that there was no other questionable activity on my account - yet XXXX advised that the only way I would not be liable for the charge was if I closed the account. This doesn't seem right. I don't understand why they couldn't accept the dispute request and investigate rather than close the account while opening a new one."

On top of that they will not give me an option to give that credit applied to my other card back to close my account. They got me in a situation THAT I CAN NOT GET OUT OF."
2962,"I would like to file an official complaint regarding Wells Fargos credit card application process. On the afternoon of XX/XX/2019, I applied for a credit card ( Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Shortly after that, I received an email that my application was pending. I thought that was strange, so I called the phone number listed in the email. I was then told that I was actually denied because there was something wrong with my credit. I knew that had to be a mistake, as I have excellent credit ( in the XXXX ). I also do not have any debt, other than my car payment, which I have actually been doubling my payments on in order to pay it off in half the time of my loan. I also knew I did not have any late payments, and I pay my credit cards off in full each month. 
I was now very worried that my identity might have been stolen, although I have taken the extra step to protect my credit by freezing it a while back and having it monitored by several sources. I only unfroze my credit from XX/XX/2019 until XX/XX/2019 specifically to apply for this credit card. I do not need this credit card, but I want to buy a new computer, and this credit card offers a sign-up bonus of {$300.00}. I have the cash to buy the computer, but I wanted to be smart and save the {$300.00}. 
After I was told that there was something wrong with my credit, I explained that there was no way that could be true and went on to tell the gentleman I spoke with how my credit rating is considered excellent and why. He even thought that it did not make sense. He said that he would have someone physically take a look at my application, and I could call back the next day to find out the status. 
I was so worried that my identity had been stolen, that I immediately checked one of the sources that monitors my credit, and there was no new credit reported, other than the credit card I had just applied for. I actually received an email from them immediately after applying for this credit card, so I knew that I was being notified of all activity on my credit, and my identity could not have been stolen. I looked at my score details, and there was nothing negative listed. They give you a breakdown of how you can improve, and I had nothing negative that I needed to improve upon. See attached score details for XXXX and XXXX. 
When I called Wells Fargo back the next day, XX/XX/2019, I was told the same thing by the woman I spoke with, that there was something negative on my credit report from XXXX. I was told to contact XXXX, that the negative report came directly from XXXX. She said that if there was a mistake, that XXXX   could send Wells Fargo a corrected report. 
I then called XXXX, and after 45 minutes on the phone, was told that there is nothing wrong with my credit. They actually said that they did not send Wells Fargo anything, and could not send them anything, that Wells Fargo only views my information reported by XXXX  online. A couple of times XXXX   mentioned that maybe Wells Fargo ran the credit check by using my middle initial and not my full middle name is the only thing that they could think of. They said that they would mail me my credit report so that I could pass it on to Wells Fargo to prove that there is nothing wrong with my credit. 
I then called Wells Fargo back and was transferred to an Underwriter. This time, she said that I did not have anything wrong with my credit, that it was because I have too many credit cards, and I have the POTENTIAL to go into debt. This makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever! I have had this many credit cards for years. It should be obvious from my credit history, that I do not accumulate debt. Why would I suddenly do that after all of these years? What is the point of Wells Fargo viewing my credit HISTORY, if they are not going to take the HISTORY into account? 
I was told that Wells Fargo does not look just at a credit score, that they look at multiple things. Okay, so if they are looking at multiple things, and they think that the number of credit cards is a negative, then all of the other things that are positive, which is EVERYTHING ELSE, should have outweighed the ONE negative. As of matter of fact, all the research I have done has shown that the number of credit cards is not a negative, it is how much you owe on those credit cards. From what I understand, if you are under the 30 % utilization rate, or balance-to-limit ratio, it is not supposed to be a negative. It actually helps your credit to have multiple credit cards. Not too long ago, when I bought a car, I was told Whatever you are doing, keep doing it!. The finance person was referring to my credit. Just recently, in XXXX, when I bought my car, I was told that I had a credit score of at least 850. It may have been a little higher, but it was at least 850. I assume that they use a different scoring system than the three major credit bureaus, since I believe that XXXX if their highest score. I actually teased my husband because my score was a few points higher than his. We have competed for a higher score than the other for years. 
At one point, the person I was talking to from Wells Fargo said sometimes it is actually better to carry a small balance to help your credit, after I was telling her how great my credit is and how I never carry a balance. I said you mean to tell me that Wells Fargo wants me to carry a balance and pay interest instead of paying my balance off in full, and then I would qualify for a credit card with them. She then said no, not Wells Fargo, that she has just been in this business for years. Now, I am beginning to think that this is the reason I was denied, that it is because I pay my balances off every month, that Wells Fargo does not stand to benefit from me because I would not being paying interest to them. It appears that Wells Fargo has gone from setting up accounts for people that were unaware an account was being set up for them, as reported in the news on multiple occasions, to now denying people with excellent credit a credit card account because Wells Fargo does not stand to gain anything from them. 
By the way, the Underwriter even told me that I might consider closing some older credit cards that I do not use anymore, which DOES hurt your credit! It seems that Wells Fargo has things backward or something. 
I am very upset because I was put through the stress of thinking my identify might have been stolen, have now been denied a credit card for no reason, have a hard inquiry on my credit for it ( which does affect your credit ), have wasted hours on the telephone, have wasted time writing this complaint, etc."
2964,"I have a credit card through Wells Fargo that I had reported for fraudulent activity. The card was closed and another account was open ( as expected. ) However, I was never notified of the new account and it did not appear on my Wells Fargo account, thereby removing the option of paying my card through my Wells Fargo account. This is a direct violation of their written contract which states, "" pay in mail or through your Wells Fargo account. '' I did not receive any mail notices until late XXXX, when my account had already been closed due to missed payments, which I again, were never notified about. I literally found out the account was closed due to my credit score dropping dramatically. I need help, as one man, to fight this giant, too big to fail corporation.

Wells Fargo again change the account to my name with out my knowledge and now expects me to pay the account off. 
I have asked for a copy of the contract showing my name on it but was told "" Because we remove banking records and history according to guidelines the application is no longer available for review ''.

However, the fraudulent charges still posted days later. 

I had to open a second fraud claim with Wells Fargo because they closed the first one without consulting with me or asking for additional information. 
I received no phone calls or emails. Only an outdated later stating they were unable to assist me in my claim."

Upon noticing the fraud, I ordered a replacement from Wells Fargo and attempted to dispute the charges. I activated the new card and found that it did not work and the account information for the card did not appear on my online banking portal.

2983,"I opened this store credit account to purchase a couch from XXXX 's XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$890.00}. I made continuous on-time payments and eventually saw that fraudulent purchases were made on my account. 

After realizing this, I took care to contact Wells Fargo in XXXX to let them know of the fraudulent charges made. I spoke with a representative who made a report and claim on my behalf, and assured me I would be contacted back about this. Fast forward 2 months, and in XXXX, I notice more purchases made on this card which I had assumed was frozen/closed. 

I contacted Wells Fargo a second time to express my distrust in their security and also made another claim to let them know I had only ever authorized XXXX purchase in my home city. Who needs to buy furniture in XXXX different cities? 

I received mail stating that on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX "" miscellaneous debit adjustments '' were made on my account after I had formally closed it in XX/XX/XXXX. This tells me that my fraud claims were denied and dismissed. 

I called Wells Fargo again on XX/XX/XXXX and asked to reopen my claim. I have no faith that Wells Fargo will honor this, and I should not be held responsible for purchases I did not make. I can only hope that by making this report, I can deter anyone from using Wells Fargo 's credit lines offered in XXXX 's XXXX XXXX. Especially due to the fact that their store credit cards do not have expiration dates, nor CVV codes on the back to verify the cardholder 's identity. Anyone could simply guess a credit card number, and it would eventually be approved with no resistance. 

As luck has it, I'm in the middle of the process of purchasing my first home, and I am dealing with fraud at the same time."
2984,"I opened a new Wells Fargo CC with promotional 0 % interest rate for 18 months. Part of the package I received was a check that could be used to do a balance transfer, which was also at the rate of 0 %, however, after using the check, Wells Fargo is charging me {$150.00} fee for making a balance transfer. While i was explained that they apparently charge a fee for balance transfers, that FEE was NOWHERE disclosed around the check that used. Had I known there was a FEE to transfer balance, I would have NEVER used that check. When I called the customer service, they told me the letters and verbiage that spells out the fee is in the same location where the check is and in the SAME letter size as the other stuff. This is a total LIE. Typical bait and switch practices. 
Please stay away from Well Fargo and watch out if you HAVE to go with them. 
Their UNFAIR business practices should be looked into."
2985,"Was rebilled for the amount of XXXX on my XXXX credit card and I accepted the delivery of the item but I return it back to XXXX and the package is taking too long to get to XXXX and I shouldnt owe this bank a dime..

2994,"When reconciling my account at Wells Fargo, I noticed that there were identical charges listed. Scanning back in time I found several duplicate entries. 

I found duplicates on XX/XX/XXXX for two locations, and then on instance on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX,  XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

I contact Wells ' customer service and was told the would be 'researching the issue '. They issued a provisional credit to my account, and some weeks late the 'provisional ' nature was removed.

I again made reference to credit scores and objective measure which is used to determine credit worthiness were 1. on application was XXXX and 2. on Wells Fargo report was XXXX.

Again I asked for other objective measures which they could have used to make these credit decisions. Nothing was provided merely being transferred from one representative to representative. Nothing was provided accept y credit score of XXXX which is excellent.

3000,"I have a personal credit card and a personal checking account with Wells Fargo Bank with automatic credit card payments deducted from the checking account. On approximately XX/XX/2019, I discovered a fraudulent balance transfer to my card from another bank, XXXX XXXX, of approximately {$4000.00} which was fraudulently transferred telephonically by an unknown third-party onto my credit card on XX/XX/2019. I confirmed with the bank that the balance transfer was not done by me, was not from any existing credit card balance that I had, and was fraudulent. Wells Fargo Bank canceled the credit card and issued me a new card, and assured me that the matter would be taken care of. Instead, Wells Fargo Bank deducted the fraudulently added credit card balance from my checking account on XX/XX/2019, in the total amount of {$4400.00}, of which approximately {$4000.00} was the amount that was fraudulently transferred onto the card. I have been trying unsuccessfully since that time to obtain a reversal of the charge and restoration of the money to my bank account. I spent approximately 10 hours on the telephone going through various departments at Wells Fargo Bank, and having been cut off, after being on hold, at least three or four times, and after spending many hours being passed from department to department. They continue to tell me is "" being investigated, '' but will not resolve it, and they appear unwilling or unable to get to the bottom of it, or to take care of the fraud problem. They promise to call me back at specific times, but never do, and every time I call, I have to deal with it from scratch with a new person. I am currently out the {$4000.00}, with no way to get it back. I have requested information on arbitration or other available consumer remedies, but they will not assist me, and just say I have to wait for their "" investigation. ''"
3004,"please reference previous complaint filed - # XXXX this is what i submitted and Wells Fargo came back with a response to a XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card ( # XXXX ) which was paid off BEFORE any interest could be charged so i need to submit my complaint again. I received a letter from Wells Fargo with a contact number and I have left 2 messages so far for XXXX XXXX at XXXX ext XXXX and have yet to hear back from him. 

I opened a credit card with WF ( # XXXX ) with a 12 month introductory rate. I recently noticed that they are charging me 28 % which is more than what they show online for "" the worse case scenario ''. My credit isn't that bad so I don't understand why I am being charged the highest rate, even more than what they advertise so I called them The guy on the phone agreed with me and said "" I don't know why you are being charged more that what we quote '' and he gave me back 2 months interest but said he couldn't adjust the interest rate. in 2017 I paid almost {$1000.00} in interest! My monthly payment is {$130.00} and {$88.00} goes to interest ... how can I ever pay this off at this rate?"
3005,"On XX/XX/XXXX I made my XXXX payment of {$170.00}. I waited approximately 8 days to make my XXXX payment, on XX/XX/XXXX. I paid {$500.00}. OnXX/XX/XXXX, I received email from Wells Fargo, stating that my XXXX payment is due, but not received. I called immediately to resolve the misapplied payment, was only given a lot of double talk and filed a dispute/complaint for the misapplied payment, case # XXXX. Confirmation of filing received in an email from Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I still made my regular XXXX payment of {$170.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, while waiting for the misapplied payment dispute to be resolved. Late fees were also added, in XXXX and XXXX, but reversed pending the resolution to my dispute, which I was informed on 2 occasions would be CORRECTED. Also, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Wells Fargo, stating that my XXXX payment is due, but not received, the next day after I made it! I called immediately, to be informed by XXXX, that my previously opened dispute was not forwarded for some reason ( despite the confirmation email I received ), but that it appeared that my XXXX payment WAS misapplied and he refiled my dispute on XX/XX/XXXX, ( new ) case # XXXX. Email confirmation of receipt from Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Both emails stating "" It is our goal to review your concerns and provide you with a response within ten business days from the date we received your request. We will contact you if we need more time to complete our research. '' On XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX I received a secure email from one XXXX XXXX, both stating "" You can expect a response from us by XX/XX/XXXX. '' In the meantime, Wells Fargo fraudulently applied another late fee, incurred a delinquency that has not happened, lowered my credit limit and determined that my balance was too high relative to credit limit AFTER lowering said limit, AND referenced cash advances over the last year, which are COMPLETELY reasonable, in the middle of a pandemic AND loss of almost 10 % wages as a State employee! I called today to dispute the late fee again, but it was not reversed. Wells Fargo is back to their old tricks of rearranging monetary amounts in order to generate late fees and misapplying payments, much like they were doing with direct deposits and rearranging ATM payments to fraudulently incur overdraft fees!!! I KNOW, I was a victim of that! I thought they had learned their lesson, clearly NOT! I followed up with a reply to the secure message email to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX as follows : "" Dear XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Attached are my monthly payments, for every month beginning XX/XX/XXXX to date. I continue to get messages that my payment is late or that I missed something. My payments are NOT late, but have been missapplied, since XX/XX/XXXX. I have patiently waited for the correction to be made to correctly apply my XXXX payment, made on XX/XX/XXXX which I was told by two of your representatives on two separate occasions over the phone, that this would be taken care of ; more specifically that the correction would be made and that the payment DID fall within some cycle, "" billing '' cycle closure. 
Since I have been a loyal customer since XXXX, and have not had any occasion to have this type of issue, regarding cycles or missapplied payments, until the disasters caused by the pandemic, I would appreciate resulotion, prior to the XXXX date provided in your secure email to me and shown below. I'm continuously reminded that my business and loyalty since XXXX is valued and appreciated. I'm not seeing that at this point. 
Please correct the application of my payment for XXXX, as it was intended and evidenced by the clearly independent payments, which I made WELL in excess of the required amount for the month of XXXX, in gratitude for the COVID assistance I received for 2 months, after I took a nearly 10 % paycut. It was not an extra payment for XXXX ; your company got my stimulus. My pay has not been restored, there's no such thing as extra money in the world of regular people. 
Secondly, your company has recently penalized me, with my credit account due to the above unresolved dispute, by reducing my credit limit by close to {$3000.00}. I would like to lodge a second complaint in regards to this adverse action. I have had NO other outstanding credit issues with any other entity, prior to this dispute with yours, in years. Please correct this misinformation and restore my good standing, as is fit and proper. I would personally like to put this to rest. 
I hope we are able to resolve these matters soon. Please help me to resolve this as soon as possible, so that we can get back to the good standing we once enjoyed. 
Thank you. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX '' To date, I have received no further communication on my dispute, yet XXXX continue to make the regular payment, even while the dispute is unresolved and while Wells Fargo is unjustly generating late fees and discrediting an account that has never been late! Please help to restore my credit payment issue, so egregiously being disregarded by Wells Fargo & Co, etal.

3006,"I thrice disputed fraudulent transactions that appeared on my card back in early XX/XX/2021. The first time I called it was business as usual, they simply removed the transactions and I thought that was the end of it. Then I received a letter stating that because I physically had the chipped card there was no possible way fraud had occurred so they re-billed me. I disputed a second time only for them to come to same conclusion within just one days worth of investigating. Now that I had to dispute a third time, Im starting to think that Wells Fargo is simply out to take peoples stimulus. Or maybe Ill simply have to pay for now and then theyll catch their mistake at a later time? No, there aint no way in XXXX am I giving them an interest free loan."
3007,I called Wells Fargo and was transferred several times. A person by the name of XXXX XXXX is using my address at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX Texas. She has her mail forwarded to another address ; however the US Postal service provides me with a scanned mail before it gets forwarded in another address.
3010,"On XX/XX/2019 I was alerted by Wells Fargo of fraud detection on my credit card. Because my credit card information has been compromised, I called their customer service line and was told that they would be cancelling my current card and sent a new one. 

They then gave me two options, receive the card in 5-7 business days free of charge or have it "" rush '' shipped into 2 business days for a {$16.00} fee. I clearly stated that I wanted the free option. 

Checking my credit card charges later, I realized that they had in fact still charged me for rush shipping. I, again, called their customer service number of XX/XX/2019 and was told they would refund the {$16.00}. 

That card, however, never arrived. Thus, in the same phone call on XX/XX/2019, they again agreed to send me a new card and presented me with the free and rush shipping options. As clearly as is possible, I stated that I wanted the free shipping option. 

The new card recently arrived, and I have been using it without issue. I checked my credit card charges on XX/XX/2019 and saw that I had been refunded the original {$16.00} as promised. However, I WAS AGAIN INAPPROPRIATELY CHARGED THE {$16.00} FOR THE SECOND CARD. 

I was happy to resolve the issue with the company the first time, but since this has now happened twice, I believe there is a pattern to Wells Fargo 's behavior. If they are fraudulently charging me, they may be doing the same to other customers hoping that they do not realize the {$16.00} charge or hoping to falsely claim that the customer requested the rush shipping. 

At this point, I am hoping for more than just a second refund. I believe the CFPB should pursue investigation into Wells Fargo 's practices of charging customers for rush shipping that they did not request. 

I can provided additional information as needed and would be happy to do so. I appreciate your work at the CFPB."
3011,"XX/XX/XXXX my problem started with Wells Fargo Bank, about a mortgage loan. Now it has started with a credit card from them that I never open.

Then I received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX at my request to close the account. I never even spoke to any one on the phone or by letter. On XX/XX/XXXX, received another letter they have my complaint. Unbelievable, I received another letter, on XX/XX/XXXX, I requested the bank to reopen my credit card at my request it has been approved.

Just the other day Wells Fargo Bk, XX/XX/XXXX was on I witness XXXX XXXX XXXX, for employees forging illegal pandemic loans, that customers never applied for.

I am a fulltime XXXX student, it was my life 's first investment and i have now been left with nothing they putting me liable for something i never received. What about visa customer rights. XXXX did not deliver what they promised. Please help me Please. 

according to visa terms and conditions, on the denial letter earlier it says, Merchant has provided the proof of delivery? the proof of delivery can not be deemed sustained because the delivery person is different including the signature obtained does not belong to me. As a customer, I informed my bank in a timely manner in every possible way. the proof of delivery provided is irrelevant.Wells fargo has put blame on XXXX and that is why I am reaching out to you as well as my bank again."

3023,I went to XXXX and my credit card information was stolen. This was not long after I have 4 issues with my debit card so I thought credit card was safer. On XX/XX/XXXX {$270.00} at XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX {$280.00} and XX/XX/XXXX {$130.00}. I was shocked that the bank wouldnt fix this since it was not me. I am guessing it has to do with my debit card getting stolen first and I had 4 fraud charges there and one in XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX I gave up on trying since I cant believe this was happening to me. I asked them what can I do and they said. I reported these charges that were not me to the bank and they said we will temporarily credit it and look into it. I just found the charges are now back on my card and I guess they denied my claim. I have not clue what to do next since it wasnt me and my information was obviously stolen. Wells Fargo claimed to be helpful but I am looking into changing banks now. Just hate feeling like I have to monitor my account daily for new fraud charges and this sucks I am afraid to use both my atm and credit card because of all this in fear I will just get more and more charges racked up and they will blame me.
3025,"I made on XXXX.18 two transactions at XXXX XXXX and was supposed to earn an additional bonus of 30 % cash rewards for the first purchase up to a maximum of XXXX cash back. I signed up for the offer XX/XX/2018 at XXXX XXXX. The first purchase was in the amount of {$180.00} ( Men 's Department ). The second purchase was in the amount of {$30.00} ( Women 's Beauty department ). The Wells Fargo system defaulted the bonus to the second purchase which was only {$30.00} - I earned XXXX instead of the 30 % of the larger transaction of {$180.00} which should have equated to XXXX . I am due a total of XXXX- XXXX=XXXX. I feel particularly misled because i had the option to use my XXXX XXXX  card for a total of 25 % of my transactions but chose the 30 % the Wells Fargo Cash Wise card promised. 
I called the Wells Fargo rewards department which repeatedly asked me for my receipt which i did not keep as the purchase was a gift for my dad and had no intention returning.They seem to refuse to request the receipt from XXXX XXXX to check the time stamp on the receipt and validate the larger purchase was in fact made first. If I were to dispute the transaction they could easily obtain that receipt from the store.Not sure whether the two transactions made the same date were posted as a batch and the system defaulted to what was convenient for the bank and at the cost of the customer, but this could be a larger systematic issue WF should fix."

I know I am a few years too late but I have my reasons why. 
Back in XXXX I was going through family issues and was homeless. I was living in hotel by hotel every day for months. I had left my credit card in one of the drawers, when I came back to grab it was gone. Tons of purchases has been made on that card that wasnt mine. I had went to Wells Fargo about it twice in that year. First time the guy that helped me was telling me that I HAVE to pay it no matter what. I asked him to help me with options and he said that since the amount was too much, I was basically forced too pay ALL it. At the time I didnt have money to pay it all at once and the way he told me made me feel uncomfortable, so i walked out. Second time I went to Wells Fargo, was in XXXX. During the pandemic I had called Wells Fargo and told them about my situation, the guy told me that I had enough money to pay it off from my checking account. HOW DOES HE KNOW? I have other bills to pay for and I didnt want to pay for anything I didnt purchase. 
I pay my bills on time and Ive never thought I would have to go this route.

I was approved for the credit card, began doing the {$5000.00} spend and met about {$3000.00} of that and then out of the blue my card was frozen and can not be used. This was about a month ago. After countless investigations and requests from Wells FArgo to send this to the backend team nothing has come across. 

The issue is Wells Fargo is stating that I need to provide my business through filing a business license. This is a Sole Proprietor business where I am using my first and last name as my business name and my social security number as my tax ID. 

The Kansas laws specifically says on the Kansas Secretary of State website on http : XXXX - Q : Are all companies doing business in Kansas required to file with the Secretary of State? 
A : No. Sole proprietorships do not file with the Secretary of State. 

Also - DBAs, Fictitious Names, Sole Proprietorships, Etc. 

Q : Do you register DBAs ( doing business as ) or fictitious names? 
A : We do not list or register DBAs in the State of Kansas. Kansas does not have statutes requiring or permitting the registration or filing of DBAs or fictitious names. 


This could not be any more clear. I do not and should not file a Sole proprietor business in Kansas and don't require permitting registration or fictious names. 

My account should be restored immediately and Wells Fargo should still allow me time to complete the bonus requirements. I have a large transaction coming up so the timing should be an issue assuming Wells Fargo unsuspends this card immediately. 

This isn't the first time I have been accused of something from Wells Fargo, earlier this year for my checking account it was frozen and I was forced to come in to prove my identity. This took hours out of my day and I was late to my grandchildren 's soccer game. If you guys want a chance at a relationship with me or my family, please do the right thing."
3033,I reserved a hotel and when I arrived the room was dirty. I did not stay and my credit card was billed. I immediately disputed with my credit card XXXX  and recover credit from them XX/XX/XXXX. I never heard anything more. On XX/XX/XXXX the credit was reversed. I have not received any reason for the reversal it just showed up in my account. I contacted the bank and they said it was in prearbitration and visa sided with the merchant. I was not given a chance to respond the merchant. I never stayed at the hotel. I told the bank it was not authorized and they said their was nothing they can do about it. I would like to receive my credit back. It was just rebilled to my account and no I explanation just out of no where. The rebill put my account in the negative. They also rebilled my account more than 90 days after the investigation began.
3034,"On XX/XX/2020, I attempted to purchase a Diamond ring from XXXX and was under the impression that if I applied for a Wells Fargo jewelry credit card that I would be able to make the purchase immediately. Once I applied for the credit card, I realized that I wasn't able to use the credit card for two weeks which was extremely misleading. The available {$6200.00} credit line with Wells Fargo was practically useless given the purchase price was {$18000.00}, my credit history is stellar, as well as my current income is extremely high with very low debt to income ratios. 

Once I realized that I wouldn't be able to use the credit for several weeks, I purchased the ring cash from the website XXXX XXXX A few day 's later, it appears as though I was bait and switched as XXXX XXXX  called me and said the diamond ring that I had purchased was not available. They attempted to sell me a lesser diamond at a higher sale price and I eventually had XXXX XXXX issue a refund. 

I was mislead by XXXX XXXX with a product that wasn't actually for sale and the terms with the Wells Fargo card was extremely misleading granted I was under the impression I would be able to utilize it immediately."

3042,I attempted to make a credit card payment of {$1500.00} on XX/XX/2020 to Wells Fargo. I was under the impression that the payment had gone through. I never received a confirmation because I thought it would take a few days for Wells Fargo to receive the money from my credit union checking. I checked on XX/XX/2020 and it showed that the payment did not go through. I was charged a {$25.00} late fee and {$20.00} of interest. I was also under the impression that I had an automatic payment set up to pay the minimum balance on the card each month in case I forgot/ a payment did not go through.

3054,"I have a Wells Fargo credit card. They have my address and telephone number. Unknown to me, the USPS was rejecting my mail. Wells Fargo openly admits they knew the statements were being rejected. They could have called me, but claims they did not have permission to do so, same with texting. Or even send something via XXXX or XXXX. In that time, I had a payment that was 3 days late and now my credit score has dropped 130-150 points on all three of the major credit reporting agencies. 

I want Wells Fargo to remove this 30 day late because they did not make any attempt to reach out to me like any other card company would do. I mistakenly made a day late payment and XXXX was on the phone the next day asking me if everything was ok. 

There is nothing that says the only way to communicate to me is via the USPS and had they just taken a small step to contact by any other means, I wouldn't have the horrible score I have now. Please help me get my life together again. It is now ruined.

On XX/XX/XXXX I tried again and got the same error, and after calling to Wells Fargo got the same response that this has been reported to "" TECH '' and will be worked out soon.

Today XX/XX/XXXX I tried again and got the same error "" account already exist '' and due to this I can not make payment and Wells Fargo is not allowing me to make a payment and seems will put charges on my account due to non-payment.

I request CFPB to write and instruct Wells Fargo to provide a resolution and also not applying the non-payment charges to my account."

I have NEVER made a late payment and most of the time pay over the minimum amount. The card was used regularly. 

The past few months I did made large purchases ( remodeling a home ) and paid much more than the minimum payments. 

How are they going to advertise rewards programs and them penalize me for utilizing the card? 

The blow to my credit score, losing $ XXXX in available credit hurts in a lot of ways financially. This may be legal, but seems highly unethical as far as business practices go."

The law says if a person reports identity theft which I stated in that first conversation they are not responsible for the charges. Visa also says if the account is in good standing and reported as fraud then there is zero liability. Not only has this company broken the law they have reported it to the credit bureaus with a false statement saying this was resolved. I had checking and savings accounts with them that they chose to close because of the identity theft and they stated it was a security risk keeping them open but they refuse to provide me with clear, definitive proof that these charges belonged to me.

I explained that I never received a bill or e-mail or phone call related to it. 

Why would they not contact me for 2 months? 

The representative told me I had switched to e-statements only. I told him I would never do that. I also informed him that if I were receiving e-statements then why did I not receive a notice via e-mail of a payment due. He had no answer. He also did not verify my e-mail address. 

Wells Fargo just took {$610.00} from my Debit Card as payoff. Resolved? after I threatened to sue which would become a class-action lawsuit eventually. Wells Fargo obviously does not want any more negative publicity."

Wells Fargo should allow auto payment to be setup at whether the account is past due..in order to prevent it from becoming past due.

A-part one of this new Complaint : It is my right to respond to the above Wells Fargo bank unfounded claims.

1-I never complained to the CFPB about any account ending in XXXX  that Wells Fargo claimed to be an account opened on my name and social security. If it existed then Wells Fargo bank just committed fraud against me and it should be severe more legal consequences to be assumed by this bank.

2- I never made any fraud claim with Wells Fargo for the amounts claimed by this bank as they stated above.

3- without my consent, Wells Fargo bank closed my personal credit account in retaliation and violation of the consumer Protection Act and in violation of OSHA Act Section 11 ( c ) the full account number of my impacted account is XXXX.

thus if Wells Fargo can not prove by clear convincing evidences the opposite of each of all my above response statements then Wells Fargo contend to the violations it committed.

B- Second part of this new complaint : Wells Fargo bank in its Retaliatory new inventions had repeatedly mailing letters from its consumer collection department.

On Friday XX/XX/2019 I called Wells Fargo collection departments and they confirmed to me that I do not owe Wells Fargo anything to be collected from those above collection department at Wells Fargo bank. Therefore, Wells Fargo bank is harassing me, embarrassing me, invading my privacy, forcing me into a state of constant fear. All that I believed Wells Fargo is doing against me to silence me from speaking up about its violations against me or consumers rights.

Wells Fargo deprived me from a source I use to buy vital necessities, Wells Fargo blacklisted against me, now Wells Fargo closing my personal account and sending me letters from collections. If I loose the place I am renting now. Wells Fargo then forcing me to hanger strike and Wells Fargo bank decision makers should be fully criminally legally responsible for that and/or for any harm of any kind to my well being or safety or life.

Wells Fargo assume full legal consequences for its retaliatory actions against me.Wells Fargo assumes full legal and/or criminal liabilities for anything negative that happened or to happen to the complainant. Wells Fargo bank assumes all the legal consequences for its continuous retaliatory adverse actions it committed against XXXX XXXX. This complaint is in defense and response to new alleged claims by Wells Fargo against the rights of XXXX XXXX as cited. All stated herein is to the complainant current states belief, knowledge and understanding and it is all subject to any change or correction of any kind by him only at any time without any notice and without waiving his rights. Thank you, The complainant.

I will not upload the letters from collection herein but they will be added to my complaint to OSHA."
3082,"I was reviewing my finances with my friend who pointed out this discrepancy with my account. I was not aware that my account was set up in this manner as I never authorized such. We initially contacted the Wells Fargo customer service line on XX/XX/2019, and made a complaint via the phone. After a long hold, we were advised by the customer service representative that they had wrongly attached the Wells Fargo Visa to my personal account to cover overdrafts. I advised that I wanted all the funds reimbursed over the amount of the actual overdrafts and any interest to be placed a 0 % until we had an opportunity to fully resolve the matter and all costs. A few days later, I noticed that a partial reimbursement of the most recent overdraft charges had been credited to my account in the amount of approximately {$510.00}. Still pending are numerous overdraft charges applied in previous years as stated above for the same identical fees in the amount of {$300.00} per occurrence, although the overdraft could have been for a few dollars. As such, on XX/XX/2019, I visited the local Wells Fargo branch and met with XXXX XXXX, Personal Banker, XXXX, XXXX. I filed a grievance with Mr. XXXX at that time. The Wells Fargo reference number for this research is XXXX."

However, on XX/XX/22 l made a payment of {$270.00} to my Wellsfargo credit account from my regular account to cover the reversed amount. It reflected on the account for a few days, that a payment was made to my credit card account, but on XX/XX/22 the amount of {$270.00} was back on my credit card account and the amount {$270.00} did not count toward paying the amount owned to the credit card account."
3084,"I have been trying to contact for payment and settlement of balance for a reported tradeline by Wells Fargo Home XXXX since the start of XXXX.

'' To meet this criteria, I understand there is minimal burden of XXXX XXXX XXXX compliance standards, whereby Wells Fargo effectively utilized an auto-dispatch response without addressing the merits of my concerns. As recently as today, XXXX, I called them again and asked to remit payment to closet this account. I was told that they could not help me. They would not provide me with a phone number to the office for Debt Settlements and Collection. When I asked if they had an address to mail another letter, the customer service representative advised they did not have this information. I asked if I could have a copy of the phone call we just had in transcript or audio format, and they responded with "" No, I'm sorry we can not help you ''. I am being denied my right to validate the debt. I am being the right to remit payment against the debt. I am being denied my right to seek origin of the debt. The debt itself is fraudulent in nature and dates back to XXXX of XXXX. I can not address anymore due to state Statute of Limitations and Wells Fargo had no interest in pursuing the company that defrauded me in XXXX - Storm Tight Windows. I provided strict evidence of all elements within this tradeline to justify, at minimum, a response to my dispute with some opportunity to seek reimbursement. I am being ignored while Wells Fargo continues to tarnish my credit with recurring monthly "" Charge-Off '' derogatory status updates over and over again. As a professional, global banking institution, this is not an above board practice and undermines the reputation of Wells Fargo and their consumer practices. This Wells Fargo Home XXXX tradeline ( 1 ) was never used ; ( 2 ) is now 7 years and 2 months old since date of approval and inception when I was a first time homebuyer in XXXX ; ( 3 ) is currently reporting derogatory as recently as XX/XX/XXXX as a "" Charge-off '', and has been each preceding month against my quantifiable, aggregate number of derogatory accounts ; ( 4 ) has never taken interest in resolving my original claim of fraudulent activity against Storm Tight Windows, with whom their recovery efforts should rightfully be sought ; and ( 5 ) has demonstrated an utter negligent degree of consumer interest, one of such an extent it is my belief this particular institution should be investigated and considered for debarment from direct consumer retail credit card issuance and banking altogether."
3085,"On XX/XX/2019, attempted to pay Wells Fargo an annual fee of {$30.00} due on a secured credit card I have but the teller refused to accept the payment stating that the fees due were in the amount of {$60.00}.

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX I explained that I did not use my card so how could I be charged interest. The representative then told me I was charged a {$5.00} late fee. I have had several other issues with this company charging late fees and over billing before but eventually the charges were dismissed. 

On the third of XXXX I spoke with the Credit Card department and they refused to correct this error. i was transferred to Customer Service where i lodged a complaint regarding this issue. The representative said it was the Banks fault and told me he would remove the fees including the annual fee. I've had problems with this company before therefore I always check back a couple days later making sure charges have been removed but as usual the {$60.00} charge is still on my card.There are XXXX different card number that stemmed from a chard that I denied, not only did Wells Fargo not take off the card number they add the charges back to my card like I never called here r the numbers { XXXX"

Not only did they do this but when I called to inquire how in the heck this could happen the account representative told me about charges from XXXX and XXXX 's that were flagged as fraud. They were in fact fraud but I didn't get a notification or anything and even though they were flagged and we discussed this on the call they STILL allowed these charges to be put on my card! 

So, I had to call again and again and they closed that card and moved the balances over to a new card INCLUDING the fraud charges! I had spent hours trying to reconcile what they had done to no avail but they finally got the balance somewhere close to the actual amount owed. Although they made absolutely no concession for the hours and hours of my time that they wasted for their fraud. The circumstances of the situation are such that Wells Fargo is complicit by their gross negligence if not directly but I believe it had to be more direct, insider fraud. 

So, the account was closed a new onXXXX opened but I kept the new card off and did not activate it. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I awoke to another e-mail from Wells Fargo telling me that despite all of this activity identifying fraud on my card and all of my pleas for their help in preventing further damage they had shipped my card AGAIN to Texas : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX This could not have been done by someone calling in AGAIN after all the activity on my account and just saying send the card and an actual person at Wells Fargo so XXXX that they just did this. There must be more complexity to this fraud that is system related and that Wells Fargo is refusing to disclose. A colleague of mind XXXX found out her credit card was shipped to New York without her permission or knowledge after she heard my story and checked her account. 

I closed the account but I have no faith that XXXX can keep it closed and free from fraud so someone needs to step in and hold them accountable."
3087,"On XX/XX/XXXX i received an email from wells Fargo that I had been approved for a credit card. I called the number in the email and told them that i did not apply for the credit, do not send the balance transfers that were associated with the application. The lady said not worry that it will be taken care of. On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a bill from wells Fargo showing that the transfers were made when we told them not to do it. 
So we asked them how to correct it and we were told that XXXX would have to send the money back to Wells Fargo. XXXX has tried more than once to do this. Finally in XX/XX/XXXX, according to the statement from XXXX, the larger payment of {$7500.00} was returned to Wells Fargo. But Wells Fargo keeps saying that they never received the money back nor will they tell me the account information to send the money to. The one thing that they do was close the account and most people agree that you can not send money to a closed account, but again, wells Fargo will not say where to send the money. So in the meantime, my XXXXredit score has dropped over 100 points and wells Fargo refuses to provide a possible solution for the issue. All you have to do is look at the statements from the XXXX accounts and you can see that the money was never used, that it sat there and in the case of the smaller amount, {$1000.00}, is still there. There has been no benefit from these transfers."
3090,"I have been a with WF CRD SVC customer since XXXX and during that time, I have enjoyed my experience greatly. I am writing to see if you would be willing to make a "" goodwill '' adjustment to your reporting to the three credit agencies. I have late payment on the above referenced account ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Since that time I have been an exceptional customer paying every month on time. Because of my exceptional payment history over the last years, I would like you to consider removing the negative payment from my credit report. At the time of the late payment, I was in the process of changing jobs. I say that not to justify why the payment were late, but rather to show that the late payment are not a good indicator of my actual credit worthiness."
3091,"I applied for a credit card with Wells Fargo to take advantage of a balance transfer with 0 APR for 18 months. 
I applied for a {$8000.00} credit line for a balance transfer. They only would give me {$4000.00} so I didnt want the card if I couldnt get the full amount. But Wells Fargo went ahead a gave the {$4000.00} and when I complained they stated they couldnt delete the credit app. But could cancel the credit card but it would show on my credit report. So in the meantime they sent me the card and went ahead and applied electronically {$3700.00} towards my XXXX XXXX credit card without my consent. This clearly is a scam by this company. I feel if they cant give you the amount your applying for they should give a chance to decline their offer and not automatically give it to you."
3093,"Wells Fargo was helping me refinance my home. I wanted to take out some of the equity out of my home to pay off two credit cards, purchase a new roof and a new HVAC system for my house. 

This and lowering my interest rate was the reason for the refinance. The loan officer, XXXX XXXX and the underwriters knew my intention was just to pay off these two cards. 

I was told I had to close both of my credit cards in order to refinance my home by XXXX who said the underwriters were requiring that. 

I was concerned about closing both cards, having had one of my cards for 35 years and the other one for 8 years. I believed XXXX when I asked if it would effect my credit score and was told it would not. 

My interest rate went up rather than down. 

I am a widow and believed what I was told. My mistake was in believing them. Thinking that a bank as big as Wells Fargo would not lie to their customers. 

I had never been late on a payment on either card or missed a payment. Since I have learned my credit score took a huge hit when losing so much credit history. I have contacted the bank to make a formal compliant."
3095,"XX/XX/XXXX ( 1 Day ) car rental from XXXX for {$110.00} but I was billed for a week @ {$1300.00}. I put the keys to the vehicle in the after hours drop box, documented on my business card the stall/car location, mileage, gas tank full, and time on the card for myself and attached one to the keys. 

I filed a complaint with XXXX the week after on XX/XX/2019 when I received the bill, called XXXX to inform them of the fraudulent and false billing practices but they would not resolve. I provided them a witness statement of the person traveling in the car with me, receipts for fuel at airport, and my parking receipt when I left with my personal car after returning their rental car. 

Information sent to XXXX : The flight was canceled hence renting the car from XXXX to XXXX airport @ XXXX, I have attached a PDF showing what flight I should have been on for reference and XXXX can confirm the cancellation with XXXX XXXX . Please inform XXXX that your system has no return slips if the keys are placed in the drop box after hours ; As previously stated to your colleague and provided I wrote down the return stall location, noted mileage, and full tank of gas information on the XXXX airport business card and made two copies, one for XXXX and one for myself and attached it and my business card to the keys and placed them in the drop box. I informed that last XXXX representative that there was no one around @ XXXX other than the airport janitor, I also had two people traveling with me that were on the canceled flight in the car. I have attached additional documentation of my fuel receipt filling up the car with gas at XXXX in XXXX at the XXXX XXXX next to the airport and my parking receipt when I left the airport @ XXXX. 

I have alerted my credit card company of XXXX 's poor processing practices and false billing. 

I filed a case with my credit card Wells Fargo Visa but they have done nothing other than request invoice from XXXX. The are stating now after months I am responsible for a fraudulent charge that I did not approve or agree to. Wells fargo keeps passing me onto other people and I can not get anywhere with them as their tactic is to keep delaying and moving me to other individuals. I have emailed and called about every week and they will NOT return my calls or do anything to resolve the correct way."
3096,"To whom this may concern. 

I have opened an account by Wells Fargo, and I am very unhappy. Please see below for the issues that I am having with them : When I applied for a business secured credit card, I was told that it has an automatic system that will upgrade to a unsecured credit card after 6 months, by making a review on my account. I have my secured credit card for almost a year, and I was never upgraded. In the meantime I was approved for a other business credit card. When I was researching how there policy works I found on XXXX XXXX that almost no-one was upgraded from a secured to an unsecured credit card. I know that I have a good score, I was approved for several unsecured credit cards without any issues, and I pay my bills in time, therefore I cant see any reason why I shouldn't get my unsecured credit card by Wells Fargo. The only reason why I didn't get upgraded to an unsecured credit card is because this whole thing is a scam, it doesn't begin to be true. 

My wife by mistake made a purchase by XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I did not give permission, or even know about the purchase. XXXX XXXX XXXX does not have a return policy, so I went and disputed the charge by Wells Fargo, since I know that they are supposedly responsible for any charge that was done without any permission from the card holder, part of their policy is : "" I have zero liability protection= that you are not responsible for any unauthorized transaction when you report them promptly ''. After a month of going back and forth with them with no customer service at all, they sent me a letter that it was declined, since the merchant showed that I did not follow the merchant cancellation policy, and I received the tickets. Yes i did receive the tickets, but it was never used since we couldn't even get any use out of those tickets, because it was ordered in error. I called them again and they told me that the only thing they can do is that I need to fill out a letter for declaration of claimant for fraud, but this was a purchase made in error, and it was a miss understanding, so claiming a letter about fraud won't help me because this wasn't a fraudulent charge. 

When I reviewed all the complaints on CFBP I saw that most complaints are on Wells Fargo, and there is a reason for that. They abuse, lie, and fool their customers in a way that all we can do is surrender. I am asking you to please look out, and see how many people are complaining about this bank. You are the only ones that can help us at this point."
3097,"This is now the second time I am trying to resolve my issue with Wells Fargo. I have been disputing a fraud case for over a month in a half which is getting me nowhere no matter how many times I call. They give me denials continually based on the facts that they believe I had the card when the charges where made or that I authorized said charges which I had not. So according to their factsI am still responsible for all the charges that were made on my credit card. Meanwhile some of these charges were cash advances to both the fraudulent checking account and savings account. Those accounts previously mentioned were closed down as fraudulent/unauthorized accounts by Wells Fargo XXXX They closed both accounts marked them as fraud and removed them from my account dashboard. So that leaves me with the question of how am I responsible for the {$550.00} ( plus interest fees ) in cash advances for money that I never recieved but rather was sent to a fraud account? On top of that I reviewed the account credit card rewards and {$370.00} in cash rewards was sent to the this fraudulent savings account for cash back rewards. If I am responsible for all these "" alleged '' credit card charges and they are forcing me to pay for these charges why did I not recieve the {$370.00} in cash back rewards? Its not fair that they are charging me for charges I truly did not make nor did I allow anyone else or authorize any other charges. I am tired of trying to dispute with them because they still won't fix this issue after a month of going back and forth they still have done nothing but tell me to wait 30-45 days for a response!"
3101,"On XX/XX/2020, Wells Fargo all of sudden closed my two personal credit cards ( ending with XXXX and XXXX ) and forfeited all reward cash and points I have earned for last 6 years. The total amount of cash back and points were worth about {$2000.00}. 
I have contacted their customer service several times and they had no clue what happened and didn't provide any helpful solution."
3104,"In XX/XX/XXXX I had my air conditioning ducts replaced and financed the project with Wells Fargo. There was a promotional financing promotion, no interest if balance paid before expiration of special financing term. I had a second project with the same vendor for the installation of a faulty thermostat - also with the promotional financing. 

I made timely payments every month and was set to pay the entire balance prior to the special financing expiration date, which I believed to be XX/XX/XXXX. 

When making my payment this month, I noticed the balance had increased by about {$950.00} dollars. I looked at my statement and saw a charge for interest. I looked again at my statement and it looks like both special terms where set to end in XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. The print is so small and unclear, that apparently the XX/XX/XXXX due date was actually XX/XX/XXXX. 

I contacted the bank and advised that I was planning on paying the entire balance, requesting they reverse the {$950.00} in interest in light of the fact the it had not even been 30 days since the promotional financing expired. 

They refused. The font on the statement is so small and the numbers and dates look exactly the same. 

Considering I made all my payments timely and paid more than the minimum due, and was offering to pay the entire balance immediately, to charge {$950.00} dollars in interest is outrageous."
3106,"I do not understand the CFPB 's process. I have explained in great detail what transpired, and have supporting monthly credit card statements that prove that Wells Fargo is fraudulently charging interest to my visa card each and every month. I have previously responded to your agency regarding the Wells Fargo statement that they deny my allegation. I believe this may be the third time that I have submitted a response indicating that they continue to deceive your agency and for some reason you appear to believe them. It is my understanding that the sole function of CFPB is to protect us consumers against the illegal predatory practices of mega corporations '. Congressman XXXX 's office told me that your agency has little to no desire to go after the mega banks. Maybe the CFPB lacks the authority and resources to do so. If this is true, then your agency should refer this matter to the FBI or Secret Service. I am continuing to accumulate Well Fargo monthly statements that will vividly support my allegations. It's your move ; please do something to help me prove that what Wells Fargo is doing to me and maybe millions of their other customers is fraud and illegal. Thank-you, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Veteran and Senior Citizen"
3108,"Recent app with Wells Fargo- I have been with XXXX/Wells Fargo since 1987, checking, savings, and in the past CD 's and securities. When I got sick and had to close all of these except for checking, they will no longer approve any kind of credit card because I have no current credit..I have insurance taken out for last ten years never had overdraft, only when I went on SS did they say I no longer guailify for credit"
3110,"On XX/XX/XXXX I made a {$2800.00} payment to Wells Fargo for a promotional balance in the amount of {$2700.00} that was to expire on XX/XX/XXXX. I also had another promotional balance of approximately $ XXXX that I had just gotten and expired in XX/XX/XXXX. Most of my payment was applied to the promotion that I had just gotten and had longer before it expired. Now I am stuck paying interest and do not have {$1800.00} to pay off the balance so that I can stop paying interest. 
The bank said I made the payment too soon and that I needed to pay it off after it expired. That makes it very difficult to avoid paying interest and provides a very small time frame to make a payment. This may be legal but is not ethical and seems very tricky. I am sure other people get stuck in a vicious debt cycle because they are not allowed to allocate their payments to the balance that they need to pay off. I do not understand why this is not allowed by banks."
3111,"I have got a new active cash card from Wells Fargo. I called a customer service representative to inquire if I had spent enough to get the opening bonus andand was told that I had completed the {$1000.00} spend for the {$200.00} bonus and I just had to wait. At this point I had more time to finish the spending but I stopped because they confirmed. 

However now I call back and was super rudely told that I only spent {$980.00} and was not eligible. Even though customer service told me that I was, they are now refusing to give me the bonus. This is the most horrific customer service experience I have ever had. I spent more money keeping in mind that I would get the rebate and they are refusing now."
3113,I was behind on payments being made to a Wells Fargo credit card account. I set up some type of payment arrangement with them but I could never see if I was caught up on making these payments as the new payment arrangement never showed up in the account and still told me I was past due. Furthermore they continued to report the amount as being past due the same amount even though I had been making payments. I had letters sent to me in the mean time saying I could not receive any more relief at the same time furthering my confusion on what was actually happening with this account.
3115,"We have an account with Wells Fargo from the company that installed our new air conditioning system. It has set equal payments and no interest. Back in XXXX my payment was five days late because of the way our checks fell, and I completely forgot about it. When I logged in to pay the bill I was told that I had to pay a double payment. One for XXXX and one for XXXX plus a {$27.00} late fee. Not a big deal, I was late. I get that, it happens. Keep in mind I was FIVE days late. Two weeks after the double payment I get a notice that I havent paid my bill for the month of XXXX. Another late fee has been posted to the account. When I call customer service they tell me it is because I paid early and the double payment applied to XXXX billing cycle. I was told that they had to put in a request to split the payment to cover both XXXX and XXXX, and to wait till the normal due date to pay XXXX bill. XXXX due date rolls around, I pay what I was told when I was told just like normal. By now Ive got multiple late fees and interest is not being added to my interest free account. I called again last week, I was sent straight to collections, and was told that they would put in ANOTHER request to have the double payment split. Earlier this week everything on the account was put back to normal. But they have reported my account as 30 days late twice to the credit bureau, causing my score to drop significantly"
3117,Wells Fargo participated in age discrimination as well as financial discrimination against my family due to it originating from unemployment-and attempted to abuse our personal reports
3118,"I have a $ XXXX promotional balance ( started on XX/XX/XXXX ) which was good through XX/XX/XXXX. As I was making payments to this card, over {$4600.00} of the promotional balance was paid off instead of Wells Fargo applying the payment to the interest bearing account balance. I have called Wells Fargo and they confirmed that after the minimum payment is made, remaining payment amounts are applied to merchandise purchases and cash advance first, then promotional balances. However, since I made 2 payment on XX/XX/XXXX ( $ XXXX and {$9900.00} ), they applied approximately {$4600.00} to the promotional balance at 0 % instead of applying it to the interest bearing merchandise balance. 

You can see from previous statements, payments were applied to merchandise balances first with a minimum amount being applied to the promotional balance. However, my XX/XX/XXXX payment was not applied in the same manner."
3126,"Opened Wells Fargo rewards credit card in XXXX to use primarily for online purchases. Intentionally kept credit limit low due to high probability of card theft/fraud due to online use. Asked Wells Fargo not to automatically increase credit limit for this reason. 

In XXXX, needed an RV loan. At that time, credit score was negatively impacted by ratio of outstanding credit card debt to available balances. Contacted issuer of a different credit card and requested a credit line increase on that card to $ XXXX. It was granted around XXXX of XXXX. 

In XXXX, needed a car loan. At this time, credit score is again negatively impacted by same issue. Contacted Wells Fargo this time to request an increase to the credit card limit. They said they could grant an increase to {$11000.00} without needing to run my credit. I asked them to run credit and provide the maximum available credit limit. They said that they can't request "" max, '' but rather need a dollar amount. I said, let 's just try $ XXXX then ( assuming that would be well above their max and the increase would then default to the max. ) Wells Fargo returns that they can only increase the credit limit to {$11000.00}, basically the same as if they had not run my credit. My credit score was XXXX at the time. My monthly income is {$12000.00}. They can only give me a credit limit that is less than my monthly income with that credit score??? I questioned them for the reason. They said I had no experience with a $ XXXX credit card. OK, that is true. I do have over a year experience with a $ XXXX limit credit card, so how about we meet there and you increase my limit to $ XXXX? In looking at my $ XXXX credit card, I don't use it. So, they can not increase my credit limit at all above what they would issue to me without underwriting. 

I need to increase my available credit to improve my credit score and at the same time, I need to keep my balances low so my ratio of debt to credit don't negatively impact my credit score. These 2 goals appear to be diametrically opposed. 

Wells Fargo needs to explain in a very detailed manner how to resolve their internal conflict because they are in my opinion intentionally not allowing consumers to improve their credit scores so that they, Wells Fargo, can charge us higher interest rates. Wells Fargo has a poor track record and here is yet another example of their really bad behavior. 

If they can sufficiently explain themselves, this complaint will be resolved. Until then, I think they need to be penalized for intentionally causing consumers to have artificially low credit scores. Sadly, we are at their mercy."

3131,"Wells Fargo apparently puts a limit on the number of payments I can make from my non-Wells Fargo account. They tell me I must open a Wells Fargo checking account or call in to make my payment. This is discrimination based on where I make my payments from. I make my payments on time, so why should I be limited in what account I use to pay the card with?

3140,"In XXXX, Wells Fargo sent us balance transfer checks be used before XX/XX/XXXX on our card which balance had been paid in full in early XX/XX/XXXX ; however we continued to get XXXX balance statements through XX/XX/XXXX. Upon attempting to take advantage of the offer on XX/XX/XXXX, we were informed that our credit card was closed. No reason was given over the phone ; we were told a letter would be sent within a week. On XX/XX/XXXX we received the letter dated XX/XX/XXXX which stated that our account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX ( the day we called ) listing 3 reasons, 2 of which were completely erroneous. They claimed amounts owed on credit cards were near or at limit ( we had no credit card balances ; all had been paid in XX/XX/XXXX ), and that there were late payments on our credit report ( had none of these either except for the hardship WF had suggested and granted to us on our mortgage for storm damage in XXXX that many people had experience and which arrearage we paid in full in XX/XX/XXXX ). We pulled our credit report which confirmed our position. On XX/XX/XXXX we again contacted them to file a complaint and state that our credit report was totally contrary to their reasons. We were told via email on XX/XX/XXXX they would "" research '' it by XX/XX/XXXX. Instead on XX/XX/XXXX ( one day of "" research ''? ), they sent the identical letter to us again and further stated that they had a right to cancel a card "" at any time and for any reason ''. Had they "" researched '' it and looked at our credit report, they would have seen that their reasons were erroneous. 
The third reason they gave was that we had no checking or savings with WF ; this was/is true. We had a mortgage with WF since XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX we reached out to WF to refinance at a lower interest rate. They could not meet competitive rates and we began inquiries with other lending institutions. In XXXX, they ( WF ) reached out to us to refinance but again they did not want to reduce the interest rate, only to extend the term, so we refinanced elsewhere in XX/XX/XXXX at a much lower rate. 
As previously stated, up through XX/XX/XXXX we continued to received XXXX balance credit card statements from WF showing a full credit limit available. Up to that date, we were never told the card had been closed, and, if so, why send us the checks. We believe the real reason that WF closed our card was that we refinanced elsewhere, yet they negatively and erroneously reported false information as to why our card was closed. The joke is on them as they have lost all the mortgage interest they would have continued to receive on our refinanced 30 year mortgage. We agree that they have a right to cancel a card at any time and for any reason. We do NOT believe they have the right, however, to fraudulently report false and erroneous reasons and to negatively impact our credit score. We completely understand why they have so many complaints against them."
3141,"Two unauthorized transactions in the amount of {$1400.00} and {$1500.00} were charged on my card XX/XX/XXXX. Before that date I was on vacation in XXXX Washington with my family, we stayed at XXXX XXXX. During that vacation I lost my card. So I reported the charges to my bank. I filed a claim with Wells Fargo and they credited my account in the amount of {$3000.00}. Later in XXXX I get a later stating they will reverse the credit on XX/XX/XXXX because the merchant responded and they have compelling evidence that I made the purchase or someone authorized did. I tried to appeal the decision but claims department refused and told me to work with the merchant. So I made a complaint with the cpfb and Wells Fargo executive office escalated the claim. They investigated for 10 days and they stuck with the claims departments decision. The merchants compelling evidence are proof of delivery and signed packages. My proof is that my card was lost, I reported the charges as fraud. My family nor I were home when the packages were delivered. The packages were delivered the XXXX and XXXX of XXXX. I was not home XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, which I was only home for a brief moment to pack and head out to the airport for another trip.

Although we have been making payments, we are robbing from our cashflow to make the payments : we are paying the credit card debt and having to spend it, again, to stay afloat. I attempted to negotiate with Wells Fargo ( regarding my credit card ) to lower my interest rate and mandatory minimum payments ( currently $ XXXX XXXX for a period of six to twelve months, so we can get our financial situation in order.

Because of my occupation, I can not have a closed credit account upon which I am also making payments. 

Wells Fargo is obstructing my financial wellbeing, even as I attempt to negotiate in good faith.

We went into the bank and they sat down with us and had us highlight all the charges we felt were not ours. This was the checking account and someone had been taking money out of her account out of New York. We have never been to New York. XXXX said we had to give the person permission to use the card, although my daughter had her card, but he was also using a card in New York, which is very baffling. Then the next day we realized they had also done a cash advance of XXXX from her credit card. The bank said they invested and there were charges months back from the same individual and said we never reported it so we had to have given permission for this. We were not aware of any charges previously and told them if there were charges we did not authorize them either. After much back and forth they said we needed to file a police report, which we did. They have footage of the person which we do not know at the atm in New York withdrawing money. They still are saying there is nothing they can do. There were also XXXX from our checking account taken. I am so frustrated with this. I have been with them since about 2012. Our accounts are not overdrawn and things of the nature.

3149,"I have targeted offers about this wells fargo Propel Card in XXXX XXXX. My credit score is more than 800 and never had a default. 
But still i am being denied the credit card. There were no errors or false data in my application. When i called the toll free # - i was told that i have too much credit already for me. it's a weird reason. 

why wells fargo is targeting me by showing these kind of offers ( with very high odds of approval ) and then denying me?"
3151,"Company claims my account had never been under a % 0 apr for purchases. However, please find attached the email which states otherwise"
3152,"I paid down my account and was in a good credit standing, then they added over 2600.00 in interest which put me at a negative credit rating and increased my payment. I asked to be removed and was unaware of such a policy. The company gave me 2 weeks to pay the balance which I was unable so now I am trying to pay down again, but it has negatively affected my credit. WElls fargo does this type of accounts with hemisphere and I will not be shopping with them anymore due to this practice of low interest and deceptive practice."
3156,"My Wells Fargo Credit Card is being declined for the past two months for at least 8 times. I have called various department of Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo is not doing anything to fix the problem. 
I am embarrassed every time my card is declined. This decline waste my time and seller 's time. And also waste my time again when I call wells Fargo Bank. 

Their customer service department is not friendly and even rude as if I am calling to pay debt to them."
3159,"Wells Fargo violted CARES Act by reporting late payment despite me setting up a payment plan while current. I contacted Wells Fargo to discuss payment options as I was needing Covid assistance. Wells Fargo customer service set me up on a payment plan. The account. Was current at the start of the payment plan. According to the CARES Act, if a consumer notifes the lender while still current and makes arrangements, subsequent payments can't be marked as late. This is strictly required as part of the CARES Act. Additionally, not pandemic or natural disaster notation was reported. This failure to follow CARES Act procedures, or add a natural disaster note has caused me irreversible damage to my credit report by causing me to be denied for additional credit.

3161,I applied for a credit card with Wells Fargo to go on vacation. I was never told I would charged fees for using my new credit card outside of the country. I could have used my XXXX card instead. I tried to resolved issue with WF but they never took my complaint seriously. I have been dealing with this issue for a month already.
3163,"Once a month I have received three blank "" Superchecks '' from Wells Fargo ( my primary checking/credit card company. Because I do not with to receive blank checks in the mail that are attached to my credit card, I have reached out to the bank to have them stop mailing me these. Each time the bank has acknowledged the request to stop marketing materials, and stated that it will cease next billing cycle. 

But each month since XXXX, I have continued to receive the unwanted checks. I live in an area where my neighbors and I continually receive each others mail, and as such I have no desire to have Wells Fargo making it easy for someone to commit fraud against my account. 

As my repeated attempt to have this resolved have gone no-where, can you please engage with them to ensure they are following the law/procedure regarding financial marketing. 

Best, XXXX"
3165,"I signed up for this card in late XXXX. The offer was for {$500.00} bonus cashback after spending {$5000.00} in the first three months. I completed these requirements in XXXX. 
I was told to wait another month. Then I was told to wait 60 days after the 90 days were up. It's the end of XXXX, I've received nothing."
3168,"In XXXX, unbeknownst to me, I was fraudulently signed up, by Wells Fargo ( hereafter WF ), for a credit card, the Credit Defense Platinum service, and the Overdraft Protection service. While signed up for said credit card, at that time I never received one in the mail. Therefore, I had no idea. 

In XXXX, I received a credit card in the mail from WF and this was when I started using it. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I complained to XXXX XXXX, a Personal Banker/Lending Officer at the WF Bank in XXXX PA XXXX about an unrecognizable charge I noticed on my credit card statement for something called, Credit Defense Platinum XXXX hereafter, CDP ). A few days later, I received a signed letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX, from XXXX XXXX, Senior Vice President, Consumer Financial Services, stating that the CDP service was being cancelled. 

In XXXX, while complaining to the branch manager at my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX, about a problem with my brokerage account, I mentioned to him what happened to me with the CDP service years before. He asked if I wanted to file a complaint with WF. So, I did. I asked XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, when I first complained to XXXX XXXX about the unrecognizable CDP charge, why didnt he offer to file a complaint? XXXX XXXX said he did not know. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX XXXX, a research and remediation analyst with WF, about my complaint regarding the unrecognizable CDP service charge on my credit card statement. He reminded me that I received a benefit from the CDP service and then said he was willing to reimburse me {$68.00} for the months I unknowingly paid for the CDP program. He asked if its okay. Unsure how to answer I responded along the lines of, What if I say no? He then offered me {$190.00}. He asked again if this was okay. I answered the same way. He then said, Since WF has no documents to prove that you signed up for the CDP program, as a customer courtesy WF will give you {$310.00} The check will be cut after XXXX. 

This marked the first time anyone from WF told me that I had never signed up for the CDP service. To say the least it was unsettling. Even more disturbing was that if I had taken the {$68.00} or {$190.00}, XXXX XXXX would not have told me WF has no documents to prove that you signed up for the CDP program and the deceit would have continued/went unnoticed. WF wanted to save money, while keeping me blind to the truth. 

Confused, I told XXXX XXXX I needed time to think about his settlement offer. After which he began to bully me to get me to say that I agreed to his offer. He was literally like an angry used car salesman who wouldnt take no for an answer, desperate to get me to say yes. When he saw that I would not cave to his aggressive behavior, XXXX XXXX then gave me an ultimatum that I had until the end of the day, XXXX time, Friday to decide. He said this translated to Monday morning, because he wouldnt get to my case until then and if he did not hear from me that I will be receiving the settlement money no matter what, meaning I agreed to his terms. So, I had until XX/XX/XXXX to decide, which I found out later was a blatant lie. It was the phone call with XXXX XXXX that made me start to investigate. 

To make a long and horrendous story short, in XXXX thru XXXX, after filing XXXX complaints I discovered that in XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, Senior Vice President, Consumer Financial Services, strategically and deceitfully withheld evidence that would have proven that I was fraudulently signed up for not only the Credit Defense Platinum service, but also for my credit card and overdraft protection service. Instead of being transparent ( as ordered by the OCC ), through a series of manipulative letters she led me to believe that I qualified for only one benefit in the CDP service, when in fact I qualified for several more. So, WF not only withheld the CDP service application that proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was fraudulently signed up for said service, but also manipulated me to believe I only qualified for one event/benefit by strategically hiding the benefits from me. Absolutely devious. 

And then in XXXX, XXXX XXXX and two other research and remediation analysts, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX also withheld this piece of vital evidence from me during my complaints because they too did not want to make me aware of the scam that WF perpetrated against me. In other words, WF continued to bank on my blindness. It was only during my third complaint, filed with XXXX, when WF understood I was on to their scheme that they gave me as evidence the CDP service application that I was fraudulently signed up for. Most likely they were concerned I would take them to court and WF did not want to be accused of withholding evidence. 

For sake of clarity, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, three WF research and remediation analysts, were obviously picking up where XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX left off. They were all continuing to perpetrate the scam by withholding vital evidence. 

WF beyond a shadow of a doubt did not want me to see the CDP service application because it would have made me realize I was fraudulently signed up for said service. NOT TO MENTION that written on the CDP service application were all the events/benefits that XXXX XXXX. XXXX strategically kept hidden from me in XXXX. 

It took me YEARS to learn the truth about what WF did to me and what I went through was absolutely insane. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I attended a mediation session run by XXXX. At the beginning of the session, I asked the mediator if he read the documents that I sent to WF and that I was told they forwarded to you titled My Wells Fargo Fiasco and the Wells Fargo Evidence Book. As he began to search for said documents it became evident, he did not read them. And then when he found said documents it became clear that WF tampered with the evidence I sent them. How? They pasted the PDFs all into one document along with other material. This changed the page numbering of both documents which would have made it extremely difficult/frustrating for the mediator to follow. Also, within the pasted together document WF placed the evidence book first, which would have made it even more confusing for the mediator to follow/search through. Whether or not this was done with bad intention, who knows? However, WF should have given to the mediator the evidence EXACTLY how I submitted it to them. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received the results from mediation. XXXX XXXX, the WF rep, stated WF was willing to reimburse me for XXXX accounts and services. Until I received the reply from the mediator, I was only aware of one account ( credit card ) and two services ( CDP and Overdraft protection ). What are the other two? Also, after reading my documents, the mediator wrote that the parameters of this dispute resolution program can not encompass much of ( my ) complaints. 

The mediator, XXXX XXXX, offered me {$4000.00} for some of the time I spent on this fiasco and explained that I maintained all legal rights to XXXX WF for compensation more in line with my demand. He also recommended that I file a complaint with the CFPB, so here I am. 

On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter in the mail from WF stating that they accepted the mediators proposal. I signed the document and sent it back to WF on XX/XX/XXXX."
3171,"I have applied for wells fargo credit card and I was approved. I needed to do a balance transfer. According to Wells Fargo a credit card ending on XXXX was sent on XX/XX/XXXX but the card never arrived to my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX. I waited for the card for almost a month. I called three times to their customer service representative phone number. Later, after more than 15 days waiting for the card I contacted Wells Fargo again and I was told if I do not receive the card until Tuesday, I should call them again to reissue another card. 
Following their suggestion, I requested a new card. However, what I received was a postal card about updated address but the card was never sent. According to a customer service representative from Wells Fargo. Cards were never sent, The supposedly new card that was never sent ended with XXXX. Card never arrived. 
I contacted Wells Fargo and I asked them to issue a new card and to be sent via XXXX to my home address instead of XXXX XXXX XXXX since I never received the other cards. The new card ended on XXXX. Wells Fargo customer service agreed to rushed the card via XXXX next day. On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX I was at my home waiting for the card but the card never arrived. At around XXXX XXXX, I received a call from a Wells Fargo fraud department customer service. His name is XXXX and asked me if I had activated the card and used it or a family member did it for me. I was upset by the inquiry because I had been waiting for the card the whole morning and the card never arrived. Beside no member of my family used or activated the card. We are only 3 people living in the house and one of them left early in the morning. Nobody open a door to pick up a package from XXXX because package never arrived. I told Wells Fargo I have XXXX XXXX cameras on the back and front of the house and dvr cameras around the house. Nobody from XXXX has dropped the card. I started yelling and become frighten because I lost my card with my information in it and used it. Someone had the card. How is possible that Wells Fargo did not observed that whoever activated the card was not me. 
XXXX from Wells Fargo did not cancelled the card but called me unprofessional because I was upset due to the fraudulent act that pertains my personal information. XXXX expecting me to be calm with the news that someone stole my card. Same day I contacted Wells Fargo and asked to cancelled the card because XXXX never did it but treated me ruthless. I am astonished by the lack of professionalism and deceive behavior from Wells Fargo. I am wondering if they truly intended to provide a credit card to begin with, I contacted Wells Fargo fraud department in regards of my stolen card and they told me that I will not be charged for the charges made by the person that stole my card and they will issue me a new card to the XXXX XXXX had on file. They told me they can not sent me the card via XXXX. Few days later I asked them for the whereabouts of the new card. XXXX, from the fraud department told me they had not create a new card but she will request a new card and that I will receive it in 7 business day and I will not be charge for the purchase made by the thief. I finally received the card and I contacted Wells Fargo to do the balance transfer but the customer service representative told me I only can make {$1000.00} balance transfer because I had used the card. I asked her if she saw any notes that I was not responsible for those charges since XXXX and other staff from fraud department from Wells Fargo told me so. I was told I was not going to be responsible for the stolen and usage of the card. I was transferred to XXXX from the fraud department and she told me I can use {$2000.00} and that she was going to transfer me to Customer advocacy complaint group. I asked her why I was never transferred to this department since the first time the incident occurred and through the many calls I have made. I received today XX/XX/XXXX a letter from Wells Fargo that says that Wells Fargo has added the charges into my new card ending in XXXX. 
It had been a back and forth from Wells Fargo with no clear answers of why they did not send the two first cards to begin with but a post card. It got me wonder if they really want to provide a card to me and which was the address provided to XXXX. Recently I have received XXXX, XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  credit cards with no problem. The only credit cards I have an issue of receiving are Wells. Fargo credit cards. 
I also contacted XXXX to file a complaint because the envelop was never dropped at my home. I went to the police department. The officer told me I need a letter from Wells Fargo 's investigation which I received today. I feel XXXX, mistreated, emotional distress by Wells Fargo for the back and forth with no results. It took so many cards to ended with the lost of the card and providing one with no enough money available to do the needed balance transfer. I have supportive documents added to the complaint."
3172,"I applied for a wells fargo secured credit card to build credit without reading all the horrible reviews on this card. 
The address in which i applied as follows : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NV XXXX on XX/XX/2017 The clerk told me if I made on time payments and paid more than my minimum I should be approved within a year or less. 
I've called for an upgrade to a credit line a few times & I am given 3 reasons which I dont agree with, 1 being other deliquent accounts which was never explained to me. My credit wasnt good to begin with which is why I went with a secured card to Build my credit. 
Ive never received any paperworks proving that there has been a deny on a credit line or reason why. 
I now have 3 other credit cards which are not secure and I dont understand why my card can not be upgraded. 
I was given false information from this branch, made on time payments, always paid more than my minimum havent went over my limit which was told I would need to do to upgrade. And now i cant upgrade because i have deliquent accounts which are unrelated to Well Fargo overall. 
This is my oldest account and it will hurt my credit to close. 
This is not right and they lied to take a deposit for an account that will stay secured forever and may never be upgraded according to the bank now."
3175,"On XX/XX/XXXX I applied for the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX card. 
After submitting my information, i received a message informing me that my application was pending. 
on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Wells Fargo. This letter stated that my application was declined. 
the reasons were : Too little time has passed since cards were opened. 
I have an account which was opened in XX/XX/XXXX, and an account which was opened in XX/XX/XXXX. Why is that not considered enough time? 
Percent of credit cards opened in the last six months : I opened an account in late XX/XX/XXXX, and one in early XX/XX/XXXX. Why is that a problem? 
Not enough credit cards, retail cards, or credit lines paid as agreed on your credit file. Since opening my first account in XX/XX/XXXX, I have a 100 % on-time payment history. I can not see any way to improve this percentage."
3181,"I have a Wells Fargo "" Cash Wise '' credit card with 4 promotional balances ( 0 % interest ) right now expiring in different dates : On  XXXX 's statement the balances were as follow : - Balance of {$1000.00} expires on XX/XX/XXXX - Balance of {$720.00} expires on XX/XX/XXXX - Balance of {$900.00} expires on XX/XX/XXXX - Balance of {$4300.00} expires on XX/XX/XXXX The due date for this account is on the XXXX of each month and I have never missed a payment on the account. I made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I am making payments above the minimum focused on paying off the balances that expire the soonest which would be XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. 

I received the next statement on XX/XX/XXXX and these are the balances after the {$500.00} payment was applied : - Balance of {$1000.00} expires on XX/XX/XXXX - Balance of {$670.00} expires on XX/XX/XXXX - Balance of {$840.00} expires on XX/XX/XXXX - Balance of {$4000.00} expires on XX/XX/XXXX So if you notice, the two balances that expire in XX/XX/XXXX received only {$77.00} and {$51.00} respectively and the largest percentage of the payment was applied to the balance that expires on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called customer service on XX/XX/XXXX and I asked them : How am I supposed to pay off those balances that expire in XX/XX/XXXX, when most of my payment is being applied to the balance that expires in XXXX? 
The guy couldn't give me an answer. He just told me that they split the payments among all the balances. 
He then passed me to a "" supervisor '' that couldn't give me an answer either, she repeated what the first person told me, and she told me that someone from the corporate office will contact me soon. 
I asked her if their expectation was for the customer to pay interest even though the customer is making over payments to try to avoid paying interest and her answer was that it wasn't intentional. 
I have other credit cards that offer promotional balances and the great portion of the payments if not all it's applied to the balances that expire the soonest. But with this company the customer would never win, the way they apply the payments is designed to affect the customer even though the customer is responsibly making payments. 

I think that this is another example of the cultural rot inside this company."
3182,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I used my XXXX card to book a hotel room at the XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX. I was excited because I had finally earned enough points to get a free room night. I prepaid the amount of {$200.00} when booking this with XXXX using the Wells Fargo card. When I checked in on XX/XX/XXXX, I used the same credit card to secure the room. However, when I checked out on XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that the hotel charged me all over again for both nights. They refused to credit the amount of {$260.00} stating that XXXX never paid them. Therefore, I called Wells Fargo ( bank issuer ) to have this charge disputed. They refused and stated they could only dispute the original amount that I paid in XXXX since I had stayed at the hotel. This is completely unfair. I realize I stayed at the Hotel because I was supposed to stay on a prepaid visit. The free room night was not worth this trouble and now I'm not even getting a free room as I had to pay the entire amount for both rooms. Neither the hotel or the credit card are taking responsibility for the additional balance due of {$63.00} after I did everything I was supposed to do from the beginning. Wells Fargo needs to take responsibility and credit my account back for their vendor 's mistake. This is definitely their issue."

3186,"I had signed up for a business credit card by Wells Fargo. At the time that I applied it was the XXXX, NJ branch back in XX/XX/XXXX. According to the customer service representative we were told that there was a promotion on the credit card regarding sign on bonus of {$500.00} cash back or XXXX reward points if we spend {$3000.00} or more on the account. The requirements were to make charges on the credit card within 90 days of account opening. We did fulfill this requirement apparently upon contacting customer service from Wells Fargo they told us that in actuality they never heard of the promotion. 
However we spoke with XXXX from customer service on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX p.m. and she had promised us that she would extend the promotion charge period from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Basically we had to make upto {$5000.00} in new charges so far at the time we had incurred about {$3000.00}. So we did make an additional {$2000.00} of business purchases on that credit card which brought our total charges made on the credit card to {$5000.00}. XXXX from Wells Fargo customer service told us that the sign on bonus would be reflected on our statement within 1-2 credit billing cycles which would bring it to XX/XX/XXXX. We again contacted customer service on XX/XX/XXXX via message center online through the Wells Fargo login to inquire about the sign on bonus and to confirm that we would receive the bonus by the XX/XX/XXXX statement. We spoke with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX p.m. who clearly said we would be paid out the {$500.00} or XXXX reward points by the XXXX statement. XXXX XXXX from Wells Fargo customer service gave us a case number to followup in the future in case we should call the customer service phone number ( XXXX ) and that case number is XXXX. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX we contacted customer service from Wells Fargo again and this time I spoke with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX p.m. who stated that the credit should be reflected when our XX/XX/XXXX statement is released. Fast forward to present the XXXX statement was released two days ago and we have yet to receive the bonus. I feel like we are being jerked around by Wells Fargo. Hence I am forced to address my grievance here. 

Please advise further.

3189,"I had a Wells Fargo Secured Visa credit card, it was secured with {$300.00} dollars cash, I called to close the account after having it for a few years, and the balance was right at {$300.00} the customer service agent I spoke with stated that he would apply the {$300.00} dollar security to the card and it would be closed. 

About a month later I received a bill that had a fee charge of {$29.00} dollars and some interest charges attached. 

I called the company and was informed that the fee was charged 1 day after I closed the account. I stated that I was not going to pay for a fee after my account was closed. I currently have a {$41.00} dollar bill on an account that should be closed. I have now been escalated to the "" Executive office '' for my account to be reviewed, but only after I had called in twice and spent about a half an hour on the phone each time, and then never got a call back. I called again and told them I would be filling a formal complaint. They have applied the {$300.00} to the bill, but I am still receiving the bills for the fees. 

I was told that a claims agent would get back to me within a week. That was over two weeks ago. I called again today and was told the agent was unavailable at that moment, but that they would send a message to call me back. I never received a phone call back. So I called again and was told the agent had left for the day. They left another message for the agent to call me back. This has been going on since start for about two and a half months now."
3190,"XX/XX/22 A few weeks ago I received a credit card in the mail which I did not request. I ignored it and have not used it. Today, I received a bill from from that credit card ( balance {$0.00} ).

3191,"In XX/XX/2015 I opened up a secured credit card ( XXXX limit ) with Wells Fargo. I had to sign at least 10 documents to open up this card and give them my XXXX dollar deposit. After sometime and with my account in good standing Wells Fargo decided to "" upgrade '' my account to be unsecured without my permission or my knowledge. They said that they sent a letter notifying me of this upgrade and since I didn't respond within 60 days to decline this they then deposited my XXXX back into my account making my credit card unsecured. 

Around the same time as the incident mentioned above my life was altered by a car wreck and I had many unforeseen expenses. Of course I maxed my "" secured '' card out during this time and when I went to Wells Fargo to close out my account they told me "" Your account was upgraded months ago. '' Needless to say I was speechless and at a loss for what to do. I still can't understand how I had to sign 10 documents to open the account but not ONE to upgrade to an unsecured account! My whole point is that if I had known that my card was unsecured then I would have definitely refrained from spending the money. I asked Wells Fargo for an explanation and they said that since I did not decline the offer within 60 days that it is just like accepting it."

3200,"Dear Madam or Sir, I write out of concern for two incorrect fees assessed to my credit card account. I have called the bank twice and was told both times the fees would be corrected, but instead I was charged an additional fee. This is also the second time I have had a similar experience in the past three months, raising the concern that this is an endemic problem within the Wells Fargo system that others may be experiencing and/or overlooking. 

On XXXX XX/XX/2020, I was issued two statement credits for refunds. Two concerts to which I had tickets this summer were cancelled and the tickets refunded in the amounts of {$960.00} and {$980.00} for a total of {$1900.00}. As I had no other expenses on this card, I showed a statement balance of - {$1900.00}. 

On XXXX XX/XX/2020, I called and requested a credit refund. I spoke to a young man who told me it was his first day and that his manager was processing the refund by controlling his screen. I asked multiple times to confirm that this would not be processed as a cash advance, based upon a prior experience I will summarize below. He repeatedly assured me there would be no associated fees because it was a credit refund and not a cash advance. 

When I later checked my accounts, I saw I had a CASH ADVANCE TRANSACTION*FINANCE CHARGE* of {$78.00} from XXXX XXXX. 

I wrote to Wells Fargo customer service through the app and received a response on XXXX XXXX stating, I understand that you are requesting the {$78.00} cash advance fee to be waived that was assessed to your account on XX/XX/2020. With regret, your request for honored at this time. 

On XXXX XXXX, when I saw this message, I called Wells Fargo and asked for the fee to be reversed and to close the credit account. I was told the fee would be reversed and that the account was closed. 

On XXXX XXXX, I logged onto my Wells Fargo account and saw that rather than the fee being reversed, I was assessed a SECOND fee of {$78.00}, labeled, BANK ADJUSTMENT XXXX XXXX XXXX. Rather than reverse the fee, Wells Fargo assessed me a second fee. 

You are hopefully wondering why I was emphatic in the first call that I not be charged a cash advance fee on a credit refund. I have had tickets purchased with credit cards from other banks to other events cancelled, and those banks have processed credit refunds without any issue. But at the start of summer, I had another event cancelled on this same card, I requested a credit refund, and was assessed a cash advance fee of {$58.00}. Similarly, I called and was told the fee would be corrected, only to be charged a second fee of {$58.00}. By the time I had the fees reversed I had placed four calls averaging 30 minutes each ( including extended hold times ) to have this problem sorted out.

Now, I have placed two phone calls and written a message, and I am not giving Wells Fargo any more of my time to resolve incorrect fees. This appears to be a systemic issue and is likely being experienced by other customers. It needs to be resolved, and so I am appealing to the CFPB to aid not only in my resolution, but in ensuring that Wells Fargo is not, again, corruptly assessing fees from customers. 

I am attaching statements from XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX showing the previous fees as well as the refunded amount of - {$1900.00}. I am attaching screenshots to show the recently assessed fees, as that statement has not yet closed."

XXXX told me it was a Wells Fargo benefit and transferred me back, Wells Fargo CSR than said it was a rewards thing, transferred me to GoFar rewards and they said they've never heard of it and transferred me back again. 

I again went through the whole process of explaining everything and asked to close the card since again I was told they never heard of it and the moment I mentioned closing a card the CSR started saying they couldn't hear me.

3223,"This will be my fourth complaint with Wells Fargo. I appreciate your efforts in getting the checking and savings accounts removed that were unauthorized. I reviewed your response about the secured credit card and would like to follow up. First I tried contacting Wells Fargo credit card customer service today, since in your last response you advised me that the secured card is mine and that you denied your claim. So when I called in to ask where the card is they say I activated since I never actually received one. In fact my mail was actually being forwarded and I just recently fixed this with the USPS. So when I asked the agent if she knows where the card is or if I can be sent one since I explained about the identity theft and how I actually never received a card, nor bill, nor even a call for that matter. She demanded I pay the past due balance immediately being as I never even received any bills or card. I asked when I would receive a card since I was told by Wells Fargo that this is my account. The supervisor told me they cant send a card until I pay the past due. Further explaining to her that I never received a card in the first place nor even a bill I asked if she could wave the late fee since I had no idea it was late in the first place. She said they cant waive it, nor can send me a card. So I paid the past due after she kept demanding it. What I am wondering now though, where is the card? You say that I received it and activated it, yet truly I did not? I would like the card, and to be able to pay online if this is actually my account? How can I go about this? Im truly upset that I am trying my very best not to hurt my credit. I didnt even know that a card was sent in the first place. Secondly I do eventually want to bank with Wells Fargo since I havent ever in the past. Going forward when will I be able to do so? When will I receive a card for the secured account you say that is mine? I never received a card to begin with. Wheres the bills going for the account? How do I obtain access to pay online? These are all unanswered questions."

( I live pay check to pay check, and this unauthorized payment taken from my account was now jeopardizing my timeliness of other payments due to Vendors/institutions/ loan holders for amounts due.

-I tried to deposit the check using my XX/XX/XXXX bank online App, but the check was unable to be deposited. I then tried to get to the local Wells Fargo branch, but every time I drove by there after work, they were closed. I believe the local branch opens at XXXX, closes at XXXX and XXXX on Saturdays. I am XXXX of a machine/ fabrication shop, and XXXX cars/trucks at home as a hobby. Work requires me to be there any time we are open XXXX-XXXX, and some Saturdays as well. This has been very discouraging. 

-After 90 days of not being able to deposit the check I contacted Wells Fargo Credit to let them know I had not been able to get to a branch to deposit the check, the representative told me the check was not any good anymore. The representative told me they would have to send a Affidavit for me to sign and return to receive a new check. 
- Two ( 2 ) more months went by, and Another phone call to WF requesting an Affidavit be sent. The representative this time told me my local branch should have an Affidavit and could let me fill it out, fax it in, and I could possibly recieve the new check quickly this way. This was promising news, and since I hadn't received either of the two said previous Affidavits sent to my home, I decided it would be a good next step. 

- XX/XX/18 I went to the local WF branch to try to fill out the Affidavit to fax in. The manager XXXX was not aware of any Affidavit which I could fill out and fax in to the credit center, however She was certain that the check could still be deposited at this time. I made a XXXX XXXX dollar deposit at this time, however the check for {$1500.00} was unpaid. 

-Made it back to the branchXX/XX/XXXX spoke to another Manager, he proceeded to call the Credit center while I was there, but we were not able to get an answer about which Affidavit to fill out and fax over at that time, and this was a saturday right before they were about to close. The manager told me he would take on my case, and work on it Tuesday, ( XXXX Closed bank on monday ) and get back to me. He was not able to get an answer on Tuesday and offering no further assistance told me I had to call the WF credit center again. 

-I have now contacted Wells Fargo Credit Four ( 4 ) Times since, to request a new check to be issued, and have been told every time that they are going to mail an Affidavit to my home, which I have to sign and send back for them to issue a new check. I have not received a single Affidavit over this whole course of time. I have even asked for the Affidavit to be sent Certified mail, but my request was denied. I have asked to speak with managers of the Credit center, and every time I am assured the representative can handle the issue. 

- I really need my money back. I have ruined my credit with a vendor that has been waiting for me to pay a {$2200.00} core fee, which was what this money was intended for originally before it was stolen. I am now debating just using the platinum card to pay the outstanding bills, and then going after Wells Fargo credit to issue a credit to the card for the amount owed {$1500.00}. 
I am so Fed up with Wells Fargo at this point and ready to take legal action, move my mortgage out of wells fargo, and any other banking that I currently do with them. 
I am also ready to post my negative experiences all over social media for others to see how Wells Fargo is treating their platinum card/ mortgage customers. 
It would be nice to hold these representatives accountable for blowing me off without sending said affidavits. I know they are taking notes on my account every time I call and none of them are doing a thing to actually help me."

There was no communication even after the payment but email was stating The following payment will be effective as of XXXXXXXX  but stating anything regarding hold on funds, which is misleading and unfair practice, it causes me not to able to make the payments using this credit card, the payments I planned and promised to made in next couple of days."

3237,"Wells Fargos actions, reputation and explanation re : this case give the appearance of consumer fraud on a vast scale. 

Airline tickets are promised for credit card point redemptions, most to be used for vacations with friends and family members. What was actually delivered are tickets that dont allow seat selections to be confirmed until flight check-in, usually resulting in friends and family members sitting in different parts of an airplane, or maybe getting no seats at all if theres an overbooked flight. 
Ticket assistance and purchases are made by XXXX XXXX, hired by Wells Fargo as their Corporate Travel Management Company, and also to act as a Travel Agent for credit card redemption customers. XXXX XXXX has the ability to negotiate discounts and rebates from airlines through Volume Purchase Agreements. 
Wells Fargo explained their process by quoting vague waivers buried within on-line Terms and Conditions that allow, among other things of questionable legality, for earned credit card points to simply be erased or not honored. 

There may be another explanation for Wells Fargos and XXXX XXXX actions that is more direct and easier to explain, but either Wells Fargo and/or XXXX XXXX do not understand this issue or do not want to disclose it. I have already reached out to them for an explanation but have not heard back. This continues to be a serious issue for consumers, but may involve negligence instead of fraud. 

Possible Explanation : Theres a new class of airline ticket still in the process of being introduced and structured by airlines called a basic economy ticket. Originally it was introduced by XXXX, XXXX and XXXX to compete with ultra-low-cost airlines such as XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. Its main feature is the inability to choose seating until check-in, and the airlines who use this new class of airline ticket continue to evolve special baggage rules, and also seating confirmation and upgrade rules. XXXX 's, XXXX 's and XXXX decision was originally not matched by other U.S. and foreign-based airlines, but that may be changing or maybe has already changed. 
XXXX, XXXX and XXXX originally referred to this type of ticket class by its original name : basic economy although at least XXXX XXXX now calls these tickets main cabin tickets, probably for public relations and sales concerns. 
These tickets may be appropriate for some business travelers who dont care and maybe dont even want to sit with co-workers, and also for short flights for friends and family members where sitting together isnt that important and saving even a few dollars is a critical issue. 
However, these new types of tickets are being referred to as third class or steerage tickets by many who have experienced them, as they almost always result in seating, if available, being in middle seats probably in the back of the plane. There is also a minimal price differential from standard tickets, which makes their value even more questionable. 
As for longer flights, especially for overnight trans-pacific, trans-atlantic and trans-continental flights, they would seem to be totally inappropriate for family members or friends traveling together who would end up sitting alone in different parts of an airplane. 
Wells Fargo indicates that the airline tickets I requested were N-Class tickets. However, XXXX XXXX does not indicate in their website that an N-Class ticket even exists as one of the options. What they do currently indicate on their website is that preferred seating may be selected at the time of booking, and that choosing your seat is free for all classes of tickets. 
However, XXXX XXXX website does offer the choice of Economy Special tickets, Economy Standard tickets, Economy Flex tickets and Premium Economy Standard tickets. Its possible that the Economy Standard tickets we chose were actually basic economy type tickets - but based on the information currently available to potential customers, this would not be clear. However, XXXX XXXX should know and understand this information, and if true that should have been clearly explained in their Response to my Complaint. 
Also, although Wells Fargos customers make a preliminary choice of airlines, destination and tickets when they first contact Wells Fargo to redeem earned credit card points, Wells Fargo hired XXXX XXXX to act as the Travel Agent for their customers to handle final travel arrangements. This is a system that Wells Fargo created, and they should retain some oversight responsibility to ensure it works appropriately. At a minimum, it would also seem that XXXX XXXX has a professional responsibility to understand and explain what type of tickets customers are requesting, and also to understand and explain that basic economy tickets are probably inappropriate for friends or family members traveling together on overnight trans-pacific flights or other similar longer flights. Similarly, if customers requested airline tickets to restricted or dangerous areas, XXXX XXXX should be able to understand and explain that. What XXXX XXXX does know is that most of their credit card redemption customers are doing so for vacation travel. They are not a mere conduit pushing buttons. 
Whether or not Wells Fargo and/or XXXX XXXX are saving money through discount bulk ticket purchases by having customers redeem credit card points through the system they have created, as professionals with access to much more information and having more knowledge than their customers, it would seem they owe a minimum duty of care to their customers. 
Im not sure if my possible explanation for Wells Fargos and XXXX XXXX actions is in fact what happened. However, if XXXX XXXX was actually selling basic economy tickets without explaining what they were, Wells Fargo should have clearly explained this. Their customers should not be required to investigate or guess about what Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX did after the fact. 
More importantly for the future, because the same thing has probably already happened to many Wells Fargo customers and will continue to happen to many others, Wells Fargo should ensure that XXXX XXXX discloses to customers when airline tickets initially requested are probably inappropriate. If XXXX XXXX employees do not fully understand the details of the airline travel arrangements they are making for Wells Fargo customers, their employees should be provided with additional training."
3238,"Ordered a drone through XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for {$2600.00} and when the package arrived, the box was empty. I promptly notified XXXX and was instructed to return the empty boxes, which I did.

3241,"Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to dispute a billing error on my account. The amount is inaccurate because following charges were not authorized or made by me. I believe there has been misunderstanding and i would like to clarify that the XXXX credit card was not in my possession and that it was stolen. The following are the fraudulent charges.. 
XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  {$120.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$49.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX {$340.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX {$340.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX {$370.00} You have sent a letter saying that there is no new information for my claim and it has been closed. I am led to believe that Wells fargo is being unethical towards me, a client who has been loyal and paid payments on time. I did not have the credit card in my position on those dates.

It is clear that all of the charges were made on the same day, in addition I notified you that the charges were fraudulent before they were even posted. I believe they were pending. I notified you in a timely matter.

I am a XXXX  in the city of XXXX XXXX, and i was only using my card for recurring transactions such as XXXX XXXX and XXXX. I did not use my card for a very long time as I was taking advantage of my low interest promotion. The above charges actually went above my limit and I was not notified nor was my card declined. I have attached my flight receipt where it shows that i was not in Texas until the XX/XX/XXXX.

When I talked to the fraud department on XX/XX/XXXX. They claim that my claim was denied because they still believe that the card was on me. They claim that I was able to provide them the cvv and expiration number on the call. However I made made It very clear multiple times that I did not have the card with me and there has been a big mis understanding on the call. Also the only reason I was able to provide such information is because I had a picture of the card on my cell phone, I did not have the physical card.

The fraud department also claims that my claim is denied because "" I travel A lot. '' Which I believe is no real reason to deny my claim. I have made it very clear that I was not in the state where the fraudulent transactions were made.

The department also say that they denied the claim because the transactions history was consistent with spending areas. However that does not mean I made the transactions. Anyone in XXXX could have stole it and used the card, it Is a big city and many people visit similar areas. In addition, I have not even made previous business with most of the companies that I was fraudulently charged for.

I am led to believe that Wells Fargo is being unfair to me. They are not taking my claim seriously. Which is leading me consider closing my card with them. I need CFPB help on this because I have made numerous trips to Wells Fargo on California branches, I have sent them numerous faxes and documents, and made a lot of calls and they just keep sending me letters saying no new information was found to support your claim. They have no information that I made these charges, they refuse to believe me, the customer I think its very unethical and I am very upset about this after months of patience."

On the first call I mentioned all the above and I also informed that this credit card was approved for my friend who is the same XXXX category ( he is also a XXXX US citizen ) and they did said they will get back to me on validating this. On the second call, they again said they were not able to validate the permanent US residency of mine which is not a relevant document as per the selection I chose on the online application. 

Note : I can share my friend credit card account details with his consent I feel am not treated fairly by the bank ( Approving a credit card for a non-citizen with same visa status as mine and denying my application stating that they are not able to verify my permanent U.S. Residency when there is no clause mentioning the same ) Am seeking your help in further investigation on this matters as you have mentioned on your website that as a "" Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a U.S. government agency dedicated to making sure you are treated fairly by banks, lenders and other financial institutions '' Kindly investigate and provide a fair Judgement."
3263,"After paying {$9200.00} to pay down my credit account, my account was closed. This action by Wells Fargo is an unfair business practice and should be stopped. Had I known my account would be closed the very next day my decision to pay a significant amount of money would have been different. I am told the decision to close my account was made the very same day I rendered payment. This action taken by Wells Fargo to close my account is both reported inaccurately on my credit report and puts me in an economically and fiscally vulnerable position at the time when I find myself impacted financially by the COVID-19 pandemic. I had asked to be placed on payment assistance and for my current employment status to be taken into consideration. I am now without a job, {$9200.00} dollars, a bad credit report that is false and inaccurate during a time when the uncertainty and I find myself unemployed with no saving and unable to financially sustain. If I had known my account would be closed, I would have not made the full payment of {$9200.00} dollars given my unfortunate circumstances."
3265,"Wells fargo called me and told me i needed to make a payment on my account or they would close the account. I made a payment to prevent this from happening with the lady who called. I paid XXXX $ to keep my account from being closed. I received emails and my bank statement showing that my payment went through. I called multiple times to ensure the payment was successful and was confirmed that my account will not be closing and it would not affect my credit. About two weeks go by and I get another phone call stating my payment was declined ( Although it shows on my bill that it was paid ) and that my account has been closed. I now have to work with a debt collector instead of the bank and they will not reopen my account stating I need to make the full payment to now remove this from my credit. I have tried working with Wells Fargo multiple times to get this issue resolved and they are XXXX help. I made my payment on time and they still closed my account and wont resolve it. I am extremely disappointed in this company and need this removed from my credit. 

Thanks, XXXX XXXX"

3267,"A couple of months ago I went in to pay my bills I saw a credit card that was not mine. It had a XXXX balance, but it even had a payment history! 

I called Wells Fargo which is the bank I do business with and they said this was a mistake, but that there had been a cash advance and it has been paid back. 

I dont know if this cash advance was taken from my funds. 

Anyway, Wells Fargo sent me XXXX letters issued on the same day. XXXX said that the outcome of their investigation concluded that I had been responsible for opening that account. ( What? ) And the XXXX  letter what is a personal identity fraud kit."
3274,In month of XXXX of 2018 there was two charges totaling {$12000.00} on my visa signature credit card with WELLS FARGO bank also there was a few personal loans that was opened up under my name without my authorization. I immediately disputed these charges and also i filled an FTC report and a police report. Unfortunately i been having a tough time to resolve this issue with WELLS FARGO and they are telling me they finished their investigation and their result find out these are my transactions. I NEED YOUR HELP TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE.
3276,"I opened a credit card with Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX in order to make two large purchases- to have carpet installed in my home by XXXX XXXX XXXX  and to buy a new sectional couch from XXXX XXXX because they were offering 0 % APR for 12 months. I subsequently made those two purchases and set up automatic payments, often paying more than the monthly minimum in hopes of paying off as much as possible before the 12 month promotional period ended and interest would kick in, and I did not use the card once more in 11 months. In XXXX, XXXX I was notified via text of suspicious activity on my account so I called into Wells Fargo and they confirmed that the FOUR charges of {$300.00} at a XXXX gas station were not authorized and I was told they'd be reversed from my account. I confirmed a day or two later that they were no longer there, and a few weeks later when I received my annual bonus I decided to use a good portion of it, approximately {$3000.00}, to pay off the majority of my remaining balance. I then noticed a few days later that Wells Fargo deemed the charges not to be fraudulent and the charges were placed back onto my account. I disputed once again and was told to wait 12-20 business days for a resolution. 20 business days later I once again was notified that the charges were placed back on my account, so I once again called to dispute and was told it would be another 12-20 business days. I have since called a handful of times to get a better understanding of why these charges are not being reversed, but every time I call I'm told there is another "" Account Manager '' handling my claim and every single time I call they are always on lunch and unavailable - I've called at XXXX, XXXX and XXXX and I get the same answer every time - "" they're on lunch but they will call you back today '' - I have not received a single call from anyone, ever. I've asked for their direct line several times but they are unable to give it to me and they also refuse to give me more than their first name, last initial. I can not wrap my head around how anyone could look at an account that has 0 charges over 11 months and authorize FOUR IDENTICAL CHARGES of {$300.00} at a gas station that is over 40 minutes away from my place of work, the place I can prove I was at from XXXX - XXXX EST the day the charges took place, and unfortunately the XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo refuses to help me to understand or to put me in contact with anyone that handles these claims - every time I've called I get an operator, when I ask to speak with management I'm given the run around, and I have never once spoken to an actual account manager. I have explained several times over that I am in the process of selling my home and will be moving to a different city on XX/XX/XXXX, and that my wife and I are 5 months pregnant through IVF and all this was also happening on XX/XX/XXXX, so there is a possibility someone could have obtained my card from the ample amount of people coming in and out of my place to look it over as we've had it on the market, but every attempt to talk to someone has fallen on deaf ears. I have an XXXX XXXX XXXX and a perfect payment history across several credit cards ( including Wells Fargo ) with several different banks and credit unions, a 6 year mortgage, an auto loan and a personal loan we took out in XXXX for our wedding. I have attempted to explain that I can provide ample proof of all this several times over to at least 10 different people, but nobody will listen and I am at my wits end. This is negatively effecting my credit score and nobody from Wells Fargo seems to care to listen or help me resolve this issue, and my last resort is submitting this claim in hopes that there is a resolution. I've done a lot of research and it seems Wells Fargo is infamous for denying fraud claims and I also know from new stories in the past that they are overall a very unethical company to do business with. It's my hope that along with getting this resolved, at least one other person will read this complaint and decide against doing any sort of business with them."
3285,"In XX/XX/XXXX I was approached by a Wells Fargo worker at a county fair who started to talk to me about college and credit and such. When talking to her, she advised that Wells Fargo offers a college credit card that accrues no interest while I am in college. I was excited because that would help me with my financials and my credit score. When I went into the branch, I was verifying what she told me and she said that I would not accrue interest on the credit card while in college again. In XX/XX/XXXX, I found out I was lied too and that interest started to accrue after 6 months. I went into the branch near me and called multiple times. They only reimbursed about {$100.00} and stated nothing else could be done. I believed them. I just found out on XX/XX/XXXX that it is against the law to lie about terms to get people to sign up for bank products and that I was lied to again. I want true repercussions regarding this issue and the lying"
3287,"In XX/XX/2019 I closed my Wells Fargo credit card account because they had, multiple times, committed clerical errors without notification that have actively damaged my credit score. I paid the balance in full when I closed the account and moved on with my life. 

In XX/XX/2019 a charge of {$7.00} posted to that closed account from a subscription whose card info I had not yet changed. Instead of rejecting the payment ( because the card was cancelled ), Wells Fargo added a balance of {$7.00} to my CLOSED ACCOUNT. 

They did not alert me. I had no way of knowing they had done this. They charged me {$1.00} interest for XXXX and {$1.00} for XXXX. This brought the total charges on my CLOSED ACCOUNT to {$9.00}. 

In XX/XX/2019 I received a Credit Alert from XXXX that Wells Fargo had posted derogatory feedback on my credit report, dropping my credit score over 100 points. 

I contacted Wells Fargo and XXXX. Wells Fargo agreed to remove the negative feedback from my credit report and it appears they did. 

My credit returned to over 800. 

A week later, Wells Fargo posted more negative feedback to XXXX   ABOUT THE SAME {$9.00} THEY ALLOWED TO BE CHARGED ON A CLOSED ACCOUNT, dropping my credit score more than 60 points again. 

I have called the Wells Fargo Credit Bureau Dispute Resolution number multiple times and left multiple voicemails with no action thus far.

3288,"I applied for and received a Wells Fargo credit card earlier this year. The credit card and statements have been coming to my correct address. 

Today I wanted to cash in the XXXX bonus and about 21.00 in cash back so I called the number on the back of the card. I was hung up on 4 times at various times after being on hold, while speaking with a rep. I finally got somebody who didn't hang up, and the rep confirmed my identity by asking several questions including my address. 

The rep transferred me to the rewards department. The rep in the rewards department asked me questions to verify my identity, including my address. But, she said she had a different out-of-state address, so she transferred me to 'banking ' which again had me on hold for a while before a rep answered. 

The banking rep also asked me for my address, and she had my correct address. She said she didn't know why the rewards dept had another address, but assured me that she had fixed the problem, and transferred me back to rewards again- so I was on hold for a while yet again. 

The new rewards rep asked me to confirm my address - but he still had the same wrong address."
3293,I contacted wells Fargo via in reference to a charge in the amount of XXXX made on XX/XX/2018 at XXXX XXXX. I advised them that I was at the store on XX/XX/XXXX and made a charge in the amount of XXXX. I also contacted the store and they advised me it's a mistake. Wells Fargo cancelled my card and issued me a new card. However they did not issue me a temporary credit while attempting to retrieve a sales receipt. Yesterday I received a call stating that my case is closed since I had possession of my credit card. I advised them I do have posession however I was not at the store on XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted the store manager XXXX XXXX and he advised that it may be employee fraud. He reffered my cases to his loss prevention dept. I am at a loss now. Wells Fargo is refusing to help me.
3294,"Completed the product change process with Wells Fargo to change current credit card (XXXX XXXX Visa) to a different credit card (XXXX XXXX XXXX) offered. Spoke with agent about doing product change versus applying new and based on the discussion thought that because Wells Fargo chooses to do a hard pull against credit bureaus along with closing down your current account to establish a brand new card account with no history or carryover, that it would result in brand new promotions being applied. It’s the equivalent of applying as a new application and yet does not appear to come with any of the new account perks and only negatives.I asked the representative during the product change if the bonus points would apply and based on the textbook response thought that it was implied that they would. There may have been a breakdown in communication between us."

3307,"In XXXX, 2018, I agreed for Wells Fargo Bank to close my debit visa card due to a fradulent transaction. I was issued a new debt visa card 1 week later. I did not give any companies my new debit visa card information. On XX/XX/2018, XXXX charged the old card for a reoccuring payment and the charge went through on my account although I did not supply the new card information. When I went to the XXXX account as well as the Wells Fargo account, they both reflected the number of the old debt visa card that was closed. When I called Wells Fargo, they said it was a XXXX issue due to it being an agreement with XXXX and the XXXX. When I called XXXX, they said that I needed to contact Wells Fargo because they were the ones who allowed the old card number to be charged to prevent an interruption in my XXXX service. In the past, if a debt visa card was cancelled/closed, the merchant would be unable to charge my account and I would have to update and give the new card information if I wanted to continue the service. I am gravely concerned about my protection against fraud if merchants can still receive payment on my checking account with use of a closed/cancelled debt XXXX card. Wells Fargo nor XXXX would give me an option to prevent this from happening. I have therefore cancelled my new debit XXXX card out of concern."
3308,"On   XXXX   XXXX   , 2017 I went   to my local Wells Fargo Bank in  XXXX ,  XXXX , where I have a couple of accounts under th e name of  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX .   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX ,    XXXX  ,   XXXX  to transfer funds from the   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    (   XXXX  ) in    XXXX    to my account at  Wells Fargo in    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX ,  where I now live. I encountered a few challenges in making this transfer and it appeared that a wire transfer was the only method available to transfer the funds.     I was in a bit of a hurry so I decided skip the path or wiring funds and just u se my Wells Fargo  Credit card to get the {$6000.00} into my  Wells Fargo  Bank Account.     A few days later I realized I was charged {$300.00} transfer fee for this transaction when I looked at my credit card statement, this was on Friday    XXXX   XXXX  , 2017. I  was shocked when I discovered this {$300.00} charge, I was not gi ven a percentage or dollar amount at the time the Wells Fargo Bank Teller assisted me with the credit card transf er of funds. Had I known the amount upfront, I would have elected to take a few more moments and arrange the wire transfer from the  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  at a fee of only {$30.00}.     I called th e   XXXX   Wells Fargo C ustomer service number and they indicated I needed to go into the  XXXX  branch office to see about a credit or refund of this fee, which I did on Saturday,    XXXX   XXXX  , 2017. I was told by the custo mer service representative,  XXXX , after she spoke with the  manager, tha t there was nothing that could be done since it was not a teller mistake. I told the customer service representative that I would like to pay off the {$6000.00} advance and have the {$300.00} fee removed. She said that was not an option, a payoff would not warrant removal of the fee.     I beli eve Wells Fargo had an obligation to tell me the exact percentage an d the exact dollar amount associated with there credit card  cash advance before this transaction occurred so I, as a consu mer, could make the appropriate financial decision. I honestly assumed that since it was  a Wells Fargo Credit Card and I was a Wells Fargo Customer t he fee would be nominal, a few dollars.     I have paid off this credit card and plan to close my account with  Wells Fargo over this misunderstanding. I 've writte n the Vice President of Consumer Services,  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  XXXX  XXXX , and cc 'd the  Governance Board of Wells Fargo,    XXXX  XXXX  XXXX , and have not even received a acknowledgement e-mail in return.     Large bureaucracies like  Wells Fargo loos e touch with what good customer service means - it means being proactive, and having a desire to help your customers make the right financial decisions, even ones as simple as "" giving the customer a heads up that  the Wells Fargo credit card cash advance f ee might be significant and a wire transfer might be much less. '' In my mind, this was a teller error because there was no pro-activeness to provide me with sufficient information so I could make the right decision. But I 'm not holding the teller at fault, this is a reflection on management not adequately training employees to be 100 % helpful and for the  XXXX ,    XXXX    branch management not putting the customer first when there was an obvious misunderstanding."

3313,"This is a two-fold complaint. First, With Wells Fargo. On XX/XX/XXXX I started working for a new company called XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was to XXXX XXXX  with my Credit Card and get re-imbursed through a WF account that I would have the routing and account number too. I never received a statement so could never verify the actual account. After making my first submission for repayment of {$2300.00} on XXXX my Bank, XXXX, within one day XXXX would tell me the funds were "" RECEIVED AND CREDITED '' to my account and the new balance was XXXX. I was then free to go buy more goods as I was supposedly "" paid in full. '' On approximately XX/XX/XXXX this was returned. On approximately XX/XX/XXXX I charged {$9000.00} on my VISA ending in XXXX and on the XX/XX/XXXX the check was returned UNPAID. I resubmitted it to the Wells account and it was returned again. This has happened six times now and all the money is on my CC one card for {$20000.00} and another for {$28000.00}. BOA says it a fraudulent account and that the account info was not the company I worked for but rather a stolen account of a wealthy individual who may not notice this charges until an auditor finds them and reverses them EVEN IF THAT IS 4 MONTHS AFTER. How can a bank, WF, allow anyone to withdrawal money on an account that is not there's? How can XXXX tell me my account is credited and then return the funds weeks later?"
3315,"{$5200.00} in excess of my Wells Fargo Visa credit card balance was paid to XXXX. This transaction brought my balance to {$5200.00} more than what was owed. I attempted to transfer this balance to my Wells Fargo savings account and can not do so without incurring a cash advance fee and interest charges. Immediately called Wells Fargo Visa and my request was transferred to XXXX different representatives. The last agent was XXXX # XXXX, her position is Credit Card Customer Service Advocate. She indicated that it takes 30 days to transfer my money to another account without incurring additional fees and interest. I indicated that this was unacceptable because the money was mine and not the property of Wells Fargo. My money is in fact being held XXXX and will not be immediately transferred to my savings account. XXXX said that there is no further recourse except for her to open a complaint and provided case # XXXX. She said that this also could take up to 30 days disposition. It is my money and I can not immediately get it back without penalty or 30 day delay."
3317,"Wells Fargo bank charged me in XXXX XXXX a late fee. The explanation being that I paid my monthly payment late. This is not true. They have since reversed the fee but as a "" courtesy '' and have not corrected their records to show an on time payment. 

The minimum payment for this installment credit is {$220.00}. I have Wells on auto pay from my bank since XXXX XXXX. I send XXXX each time. Each month the check was cashed on time except for XXXX. Wells had my money on time in XXXX ( remember auto pay ) but did not cash it until late XXXX and claimed I sent it late. 

I have written to Senior Management and the BoD asking for an explanation and correction of the records. They have not replied. 

My guess is that they have operational difficulties or trying to extract additional fees from customers."
3318,"According to their policy they will withhold the money until the dispute is closed but they did not. Every month for past 3 months ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) I have paid the full balance. I waited for 3 months for the credit to show back on my balance statement, but it still has not been credited. They told me it would take up to 60 days for the credit. Then they told me that the merchant was only going to credit back a partial amount but the never credited my account. I still do not see any kind of credit on my account. They asked me why I don't try to get the money back from the merchant and I told them that I have already tried but merchant failed to answer me to give them a solution. I have been trying to get this issue resolved for a while now. Yesterday, after 3 hours of being on the phone with them they transferred me to a supervisor and the supervisor then hung up on me. I called back and got another supervisor and they told me they would call be back and they never did. I was on the phone with them for 4 hours in the morning and 3 hours in the afternoon, but the issue still has not been resolved. I have spoken to the following employee at Wells Fargo : XXXX XXXX XXXX ext. XXXX when I call that number no one picks up the phone, she was supposed to explain why I was only going to get partial amount from the merchant. I told her that I wanted the full amount and to explain to me why. The person who filed the dispute was named XXXX XXXX XXXX. I disputed this on XX/XX/2020 and the amount was for {$55.00} they said that they would give me a temporary credit, but one was never given. The claim number they gave me was : XXXX. They told me that they would give me a solution on XXXX XXXX and they never contacted me with a resolution. I am have been disputing the following transactions : approximately, {$54.00} and {$16.00}. 
The 2 amount refunds of {$14.00} and {$25.00} being made by XXXX XXXX by XXXX on XX/XX/2020 for those drug purchased on XXXX and XX/XX/2020 where XXXX XXXX failed to process my prescription through the appeals for denial of medical necessity that is cover by my XXXX  Medicare and Medicaid plans. These issues were either the negligence or concealment of Wellfargo agents XXXX and XXXX where I claimed the full amount of my benefit starting on XX/XX/2020 with XXXX XXXX for those new claims in contrast to the mismatching payments by Well Fargo agents. On XX/XX/2020, I disputed 2 claims with XXXX as : XXXX # XXXX purchase date XX/XX/2020 amount {$16.00} and claim # XXXX purchase date XX/XX/2020 amount {$55.00}. XXXX agents promised to dispute the full amounts and hold the payments without paying to merchant, but they collected my full payments and never credited back to my account without proper response either the reason of XXXX  for short refund or denial my appeal for refunds. By XXXX  regulations they had to response within 3 for refund ; however, XXXX  failed to implement their policy and XXXX XXXX was no longer with XXXX  and no-one to follow up. Therefore, I had to go through my XXXX credit card to get my money back, but I received the unprofessional, unethical, disrespectful of XXXX agents as my written complaints to explain the harassment and irresponsible of their agents. I have never received the official resolution of Wellfargo as XXXX XXXX mis-statement on her solution letter. So far, I attach the 10 page of XXXX  complaints to XXXX XXXX for disputing when they denied to dispute my claims because I had to deal with XXXX  for my refund not Wellfargo."
3321,"I have a loan with WELLS FARGO late payment on my credit report. As you can see, I have always had a stellar payment record with this company. I tried contacting both XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and WELLS FARGO with no successful resolution. XXXX, XXXX and XXXX were reporting me late. There was definitely an error on their part. I was never 30 days late XXXX - XX/XX/2018."
3322,"I have opened my Wells Fargo Cash Wise VISA credit card approximately 2.5 years ago after receiving a promotional solicitation offer. As part of that offer, the foreign transaction fees would be waived. I haven't had a chance to use this particular credit card overseas until recently, during my trip abroad ( mid-XX/XX/2019 ). Upon my return and double checking my charges, I noticed that Wells Fargo applied 3 % foreign transaction fees to every purchase i made during my XX/XX/2019 trip abroad. Again, I am very adamant that the promotional offer materials under which i opened this credit card clearly specified no foreign transaction fees."
3323,This account that is being reported 30 days late on my credit report on XX/XX/2018 does not seem to be reporting accurately and legally per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ). I would like for you to investigate the late payment history and prove to me that in fact was delinquent on the date reported. It is the responsibility of the furnisher to report accurate information per Section 623 of the FCRA and it is the responsibility fo the Credit Bureau to hold them to those standards.
3328,"I logged into my account on XX/XX/2018, and received a notification that my account was closed.

After carefully reviewing the risk related to your account, we must advise you that your account is being closed immediately and no additional transactions will be permitted.

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

-- - With all accounts being paid in full each month and only utilizing one percent or less of my total credit card limit, this risk evaluation does not make sense.

Every month I'm told they will reverse the late charge they try to charge me and fix my account. They have done this since XX/XX/XXXX and every month I receive a statement where they reverse the late fees and attempt to charge them again. I have been transferred to their "" corporate response team '' since this affects my credit as well and again have been told twice verbally and in writing that they have corrected the problem. Yet still I continue to received statements trying to collect a late fee. I feel harassed and don't know what to do to get this resolved.

3332,"When I began with my credit card. I made normal payments like usual on them for a consecutive amount of months no problem.however around XXXX the card went missing so I was checking to see if the card was closed. They let me know it should be done and I waited awhile for everything to go back to normal. More payments soon appeared onto the card and I asked the bank if the card was really closed, but instead they closed down the account And didnt allowed me to no longer access my account directly. Soon after even when the account kept being messed with after this event I still wasnt let on what was happening. They finally lmk that I owe them over XXXX dollars worth from what was built up on my credit card from this fraud but had no idea why they couldn't just prevent any use of the card.my only concern then was to find a answer to which they told me they came to the conclusion it was me or someone I willing let do this. I dont know how it makes sense to let someone use up your credit card when I clearly said close it but they didnt want to listen. This needs to be fixed"

Today I saw, the charge reappeared on my statement for my new card on XX/XX/2022. I called Wells Fargo and they told me the claim was denied because the card was always in my possession. I was given no notice or explanation of this decision. They opened a new claim, but I find this to be unacceptable that I need to spend money and have this charge on my account.

Less than a week later, I received in the mail from Wells Fargo a XXXX XXXX  credit card with a $ XXXX line of credit and account agreement.

I was charged this amount on XX/XX/18 for a card being renewed on XX/XX/18 A Wells Fargo Banker mentioned that if I switched to their new Propel card within three months of the expiration of the card, the annual card fee would be refunded in full. 

I called on XX/XX/18 to make this switch, and was told that the switch could not be made on that day, but I should call back in 2 days. The agent I spoke to explicitly confirmed that the card fee would still be refunded with the product switch. 

I called back and switched to the new card, and again confirmed that the card fee from the old card would be refunded. 

After a few weeks I hadn't received a new refund, although the account had been cancelled and a new account opened with a different card. I called Wells Fargo, and they said that I was still owed a refund, but that it sometimes takes a few billing cycles to process. 

In XXXX I still hadn't received a refund, and I emailed Wells Fargo. At this time I was told that I was only charged {$25.00} and this had happened in XXXX, and no refund was owed. I asked for a fuller explanation and was told that the first response was completely wrong, and that I had in fact been charged {$170.00}, but that I wasn't eligible for a refund. 
I asked them to investigate and explained the conversations that I had on the phone in XXXX, and that the agent had noted that a refund was due. 

Wells Fargo promised to investigate and have the 'Executive ' team contact me within 2 business days. Wells Fargo failed to contact me in the meantime, and has ignored all written questions since then as well."

When I expressed my dissatisfaction of how I cant even use my credit card and maybe the news can help me to expose their unbelievable practices she even responded I was overreacting seriously! I feel that they are profiling me as to how I can pay my card off! Just like that. Discrimination is the word. Well this to me is unheard of and instead of treating me like a great customer Im getting treated like a criminal unworthy of credit after my payment. I paid off the account because Id rather pay with a credit card for security purposes and insurance. 

I think I shouldve gotten someone immediately to handle my situation and not be put through this aggravation."
3352,"Wells Fargo repairing my credit history and coming with a far better compensation than the {$50.00} shady check, that if we were to cash it, would immediately mean we have agreed that this issue was resolved to our satisfaction, when in reality, is the exact opposite."
3354,"I have 6 Promotional balances ( 0 % ) with Wells Fargo. The balances are due at varying times starting XX/XX/2020. 
I am paying large payments to pay off each separate balance before it is due, but they are spreading out the payment a little to each balance. 
I called them and spoke to 3 people. They said the payment first covers the minimum due and then is applied equally to all balances, not the one that is due earliest. One rep told me that they apply the payment to the balance with the most risk, which would be the one due the soonest, right? 
The only thing stated in the offer close to regarding this is this : Your minimum payments will be applied first to lower APR balances before higher ones. ( mine are all 0 % ) Payments in excess of the minimum payment will generally be applied to balances with higher APR 's first. 
This must be illegal, to not pay off my balance that is due the soonest."
3356,"I have a visa card w/wells fargo that I have been intently trying to pay down. I have been making automatic payments of {$140.00} every 2 weeks to them. I have 2 promotional zero percent balances with them. Presently, as of my XXXX statement it is as follows : {$2300.00} 0 % till XX/XX/20 {$8200.00} 0 % till XX/XX/20 When I make payments, Wells Fargo, unfairly credits more towards one balance then the other -- making it essentially impossible to pay off the 1st promotional balance before the expiration date. For example, I was told when they receive the first {$140.00} payment they distribute as follows : {$32.00} goes towards the {$2300.00} {$110.00} goes towards the {$8200.00} Why aren't they distributing the {$140.00} ( x2 ) evenly to each balance? I feel that puts me at a disadvantage, afterall it is the same interest rate for each balance. 

I called wells fargo, explained that my goal was to target & paydown these debts & I wanted to make a {$1000.00} payment to go solely to the {$2300.00} balance & they said that I couldn't. I spoke w/3 people & the last person said he would file a complaint & someone from Case Mgt would get back w/me. I did this just today, so I expect they will be following up w/me, but based on the fact that I had to talk to 3 different people and file a complaint, it appears this is their practice and I feel a complaint is warranted regardless, even if my issue with them directly is handled satisfactorily. 

I feel this is unfair credit/banking practices because I have been paying more than the minimum owed, I don't understand why I can't direct my payments where I want them to go ( I can do this on my mortgage for example, and make extra payments & direct them to my principal ). 

The only resolution I was provided was that I would have to wait till the 1st promotion ended and then I would have a window where I could pay that balance in full w/in the billing cycle before the higher interest rate started accruing, but that doesn't seem fair. I want to make a payment today of $ XXXX, and next month of $ XXXX, to target that balance and attempt to zero it out before XX/XX/20 and I feel I have the right to do that but wells fargo says that I can not."

I called them and spoke to several different people escalated all the way up to the Fraud Department, who would not reopen my account.

Before they changed it, it would have been MUCH more efficient for notification that this new limit would bring me so close to the new limit so that they could change a OVER CHARGE LIMIT CHARGE PRIOR to the subsequent and forthcoming statement date.

Since the bank was able to pay for the Cashier 's Check, it did not occur to me to question the validity of the Cashier 's Checks and assumed those were legitimate transactions. I emailed the scanned copies of the gift cards to the fraudulent party. 

After few days, the bank email alerts me with a negative balance in my checking account for the return of the Cashier 's Checks with notation 'ALTER/FICT '. I visited the bank and explained them the situation and questioned why did they gave me the cash if those were fictitious cashier 's checks. This fraud was avoidable if the bank would have taken the correct step in time. I requested for bank 's insurance to cover this loss which was in part aided by the lapse of verification steps while disbursing money against cashiers ' check. The bank did not consider my request and they asked me to deposit money into the account to avoid further penalties and adverse reporting to credit rating agencies due to the negative balance. 

Generally cashier 's check is issued by bank to a legitimate party only after receiving an equivalent cash amount. Hence it should be within the procedure of the bank to validate the legitimacy of the cashier 's check before disbursing money against that. This understanding of the process caught me off guard and exposed me to this loss. That lapse on the part of the bank has an indirect role to play in my loss.

Typical scenario is balance is paid in full. Days later transactions from previous month are added to a carryover balance no interest is charged and dates indicate their posting before the balance is paid in full on due date.

3375,"Indiscriminate Closure of Wellsfargo Accounts I will like to bring the Bureau attention to the unfair practice of wellsfargo Bank closing my accounts on the presumption that I was a victim of fraud. I am a recent XXXX still searching for a reasonable job. 
The incident happened on XX/XX/XXXX When I was expecting some funds to cover for living expenses from a friend while in a transition period of switching jobs, she was supposed to call me before the making the deposit but Unfortunately I was in an Interview when she went to the bank The expected amount was {$1200.00} but she raised a cashier check of {$3500.00}. The difference in the anticipated and the actual amount made the bank to reject then deposit and proceed with a harsh decision to restrict my deposit accounts ( saving and checking ) from any further deposit and be scheduled for closure on XX/XX/2018. The reason was disguised as a business decision. 
Moreover, Wellsfargo decided to take their decision a step further to schedule the closure of my credit card account which had nothing to do with the deposit accounts. I have been a customer for almost eight years and never had I for once had a late payment or any other penalties on the credit card account. It is pretty disheartening that bank like wellsfargo will still repeat a decision for which a former employee exposed the bank to the media for unfair practices in XX/XX/2018 ( https : XXXX ) Lastly, Looking back at the incessant amount of scandals that wellsfargo bank has been involved over the past 18-24 Months.

This month ( end of XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX ) my business credit card was unceremoniously canceled with no notice to me, no phone call, text or email, no opportunity to object. I only know because my online account shows it was closed. 
When I contacted Wells Fargo, they said it was closed because Risk Management decided to do it because of my credit score. This is ridiculous for several reasons : My long history of good credit with Wells Fargo. 
My XXXX score on the Wells Fargo website is XXXX. 
My credit score with XXXX went down recently because an account I co-signed for had been paid late the account was opened before COVID, the person lost her job because of COVID, she has tried to start her own business and it is difficult because of COVID, her former XXXX husband is not paying court-ordered child support and the state is not helping her to garnish it, and now she has XXXX XXXX. 
They did not cancel my regular credit card which I pay off every month on time. 
My business account with Wells Fargo had more than {$1000.00} in it at the time. 
My business credit card ( the one they cancelled ) typically only has a monthly charge of {$19.00} which is paid every since month on time. 
To make matters worse, yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) they added a charge of {$.00} to the card they canceled that had a XXXX balance at the time. 
I put in a complaint with Wells Fargo which they are supposedly investigating. And I was not able to state my case, they just took an abbreviated version and created a case, but I dont know what it says. But even if they find that they were wrong, they can not restore that card."

The second time a late fee of {$37.00} was assessed on XX/XX/2018 by Wells Fargo and despite admitting that error is on their part, still refuses to reverse the charge.

At that time, I have had no history and as a international student who knows just one bank, Wells Fargo, which is located at my university I heard what they told me and open the secured credit card in XX/XX/2014 with Wells Fargo. 

Now, after almost 4 years of having this secured credit card and pay more than {$100.00} of fees to obtain the card each year my credit card has not been upgraded yet. My credit score is excellent now, I have had no late payment and I always use less than 10-30 % of  my credit line. I have credit cards from XXXX and XXXX XXXX and have more than {$15000.00} of credit line in total. I receive offers from different credit cards each week as well. I called Wells Fargo many times and went to their different branches to request for upgrading but they just decline and the only reason they sometimes provide is that I am not Citizen neither Permanent resident in US which is not supposed to be a problem since I have Social Security card and I have different credit cards from different credit card issuer. I even asked to at least pay me back the entire fees that I have paid since XX/XX/2014 which is {$120.00} and wave the fees for the future to worth for me to obtain the credit card but they did not do that as well.

I understood and do not want any additional hard checks on my account as I am trying to repair the damage due to the XX/XX/XXXX incident. I instead inquired how I could put my revised salary information on my account, given this card was initially opened in XX/XX/XXXX, likely the salary information is from that time frame. I was told there was no way to update my salary information on the account without a hard credit check, which surprises me. I tried multiple chat and phone representatives and even spoke to a Wells Fargo branch manager who actually recommended I submit this complaint since she in the past had similar issues.

He also sold me XXXXXX/XX/XXXXHeadphones which he also told me were worth {$790.00} a piece and I ended up buying two of them from him, even though the fraudulent receipt he sent in as proof of my purchase to Mastercard said that I bought 9 pairs of headphones and nothing else when that was clearly not true from my original complaint to the credit card company but this did not seem to matter to Mastercard and they have sided with the merchant. I also bought a phone case + power bank that was supposed to fit my son 's XXXX XX/XX/XXXXXXXX but the unit he sold me was for an XXXX XXXX so there was no way they could be compatible. Even this mistake was not corrected. Along with this, one of the two sets of headphones I bought ( I bought a white pair and a black pair ) the white pairs charging port was broken when it was taken out of the box which was also immediately reported to the seller and they told us that we would have now go through the manufacturer instead even though it was well within the 14 day return period on the receipt.

This transaction was done over 2 credit cards so there are technically 2 complaints, one for Wells Fargo/Visa and one for XXXX XXXXMastercard. The mini projector was put on the XXXX card so the dispute was handled by Mastercard. The XXXX XX/XX/XXXX dispute/case number is XXXX for {$1000.00}. 

The case for Wells Fargo/Visa was initially given the dispute number XXXX but on internal documents, it was referenced as XXXX so I am not sure which is the proper one to reference is by going forward. This was a dispute for everything that wasnt the XXXXXX/XX/XXXXMini Projector so that was for the 2 pairs of headphones, 2 Bluetooth speakers, 2 solar power banks, 1 pair of VR Goggles ( even though they really arent, if you go into the attachment Wells Fargo Response to itemized receipt letter.pdf you will see that these are little more than the XXXX cardboard VR goggles that require you to place your phone into the front of them and the only interactivity is to turn your head and have the poorly made games auto-fire until you hit something, not worth {$1500.00} it claimed, let alone the {$500.00} I paid. 

The reason I have not filed this before now is that I never got the original paperwork from XXXXXX/XX/XXXX and Wells Fargo as to why they made the determinations that they did until just recently. For the XXXX XX/XX/XXXX case I received paperwork dated back to XX/XX/XXXX but I only received it within the last 30 days. It claims that no credit was given because the merchant claims that I never requested credit and that I did not contact them within 14 business days which you can see is completely false. I provided all the record of my text message interactions with the salesperson ( First name XXXX, cell phone number XXXX ) asking for a way to return the items to them within days of me arriving home ( on the XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX ). 

As far as Wells Fargo goes their dispute is very similar but has some strange quirks to it as well. The story is about the same for them except that the itemized receipt that was sent to them claimed that I purchased 1 x XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the headphones ) then 4 x XXXX XXXX XXXX, then 4 more XXXX XXXX XXXX then 1 waterproof XXXX speaker ( the Bluetooth speaker I spoke of above ) and 2x Power case for XXXX XXXX when I bought 1 of these cases and it was for a XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, and I only bought 2 pairs of headphones, not 9 of them. I brought this to Wells Fargo/Visas attention, but they claim that since the merchant could produce the signed receipt then I had to pay no matter what. This time the total amount sold matches but once again the time of day, the transaction number, and authorization codes do not match so they can not possibly be the same receipt yet this was upheld in the arbitration process that Mastercard forces you to use. 

I received the last letter from Wells Fargo confirming this decision on XX/XX/XXXX, which is again why it has taken me so long to get this turn over to any law enforcement agencies, during this whole time I only ever received 2 or 3 letters from Wells Fargo, most of the contact was over the phone and recorded by them so you shouldnt have a problem getting access to it. 

I had to call Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX to find out what had happened because it had been several months, and I had not heard anything from them. I was then contacted by XXXX XXXX. ( She was not willing to provide her last name, which I find absurd but ok ), she is in the executive office of Wells Fargo, her direct line is XXXX ext XXXX she explained to us that yes, she does see the discrepancy and agrees that we should get credit but that we had already used both attempts at arbitration so we had no recourse and should have filed the disputes properly, to begin with. Since we had no control over the way the customer service associates started any of my disputes how could I possibly have done that? I explained it to her like this Say I went into a jewelry store and they sold me a diamond ring that they certified was worth {$10000.00} but then I bring it to a third-party appraisal group and they tell me I was scammed and it was worth only {$10.00} this would most definitely be considered fraud by the local law enforcement but this is not considered fraud by the credit card agencies? and she agreed that yes the situation is exactly the same and that no, we should have gotten a refund but that there is nothing that she can do for us now and she urged us to pass this along to consumer protection agencies. 

As you can see from the document entitled XXXX Chat Transcript.pdf my son went to XXXX chat and asked them about the {$5000.00} XXXX XXXX Mini Projector and whether XXXX actually backed up those prices or of if the price could be set by the third party seller to whatever they wanted. According to the representative as long as the items were not deemed essential items such as hand sanitizer then there was no price checking ongoing. It was up to the consumer to evaluated whether the item was actually worth {$5000.00} or not. I then sent this transcript to the XXXX and never heard anything back from them at all but they did shut down the XXXX XXXX store that was selling the {$5000.00} item and started a brand new store called XXXX XXXX with the same pricing scheme as before but it was obviously the same people running it. 

All of this information I would have thought would be more than enough to get the credit card companies to reverse the transactions and that would be that ; I even offered to send all the stuff back to them to try to resell to some other people but that was never good enough. So now I am passing all of this off to as many consumer protection agencies and law enforcement agencies that I can think of and that will listen to my complaint. This will at least be sent to the Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, FTC, SEC, and XXXX  if I can not find anymore. I expect that these agencies will actually do their job and look over the evidence and not just side with the merchant because they have a signed slip of paper. I didnt agree to be defrauded, so that slip of paper should be meaningless after all of the evidence I have provided. 

The letters attached as Wells Fargo Final Response And XXXX XX/XX/XXXXFinal Response are the last letters that I got in the mail from them but they may not be the last time I had contact with them over the phone, however, as things stand now, there is no active investigation on either account and according to them, I owe all the money that was charged. Please help me fight this as I do not have the money to hire a lawyer and fight it directly myself. 

Thank you, XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX"
3398,"I had filed a dispute for a transaction that merchant did not provide services as agreed. I tried to work with merchant but was unsucessful. When WellsFargo revuewed the clsim they provided me with temp credit as my dispute was making sense. When the case went to XXXX  abritation, XXXX declined saying there is no breakdown for price. Wells Fargo also reversed the credit on my account. WellsFargo is not willing to appeal the case saying its costly affair. My question is if the merchant never provided breakdown on actual invoice, how I as a consumer can provide that. The breakdown of charge allocation should be from merchant not consumer"

Not Fair!!!"
3401,"In XX/XX/2010, my MC was charged {$2000.00} to a company called XXXX XXXX. I had never heard of this company or done business with them. I called Wells Fargo Credit Card Services and reported this fraud. They told me that I had done business with them and received services. I tried to contact such company but no such company existed. I asked them if they had a contact number and/or what services had I received. They couldn't tell me. At that time I was naive and believed what a big company told me even though I knew it wasn't true. 

Now that I know my rights I have tried to contact them again, including reporting them to CFPB in the past. ( Case numbers : XXXX and XXXX. ) I believe they think I am right, but are using the expired time limit as an excuse. I didn't expire the time. 
In fact, I reported the fraud the first time it appeared on my statement back in XX/XX/2010. 
This is their problem and they need to solve the problem without giving me excuses. I'm sorry it has taken so long but I shouldn't be punished for it. I won't even charge them interest on my money. 

I have been a long time member of this bank ( XXXX 's ) since I moved to XXXX. They need to find a way to resolve this. I won't give up and will go further down the line."
3407,I contacted Wells Fargo by phone and by email and provided them documents and pictures and notes from other businesses so they could at least apply a temp credit its been 4 months and they are still working on it and have failed to give me a provisional creditDispute Number : XXXX Date Posted : XX/XX/2022 Merchant Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Amount of Transaction : XXXX Card Number : XXXX Status : Information Received Since then I had to have the whole engine removed and much more because of the original merchant not doing the correct repairs or repairs that were needed he was guessing
3411,"In XXXX XXXX, I received a call from Wells Fargo claiming that I had an overdue credit card charge for {$77.00} to XXXX XXXX, that had accrued approximately {$80.00} in late fees and interest. I told them I had not received any statement to that effect, and in fact had not received any statement at all from them for many months ( I never use that card except at locations that do not accept my XXXX card, which are very rare ... here once in 9 months ) After checking they told me that the mailing address on my account had been changed for XX/XX/XXXX, to a XXXX XXXX address ( I'm in Hawaii ), and all billing and notifications had been going to that address. I asked them how they could change the account billing address without confirming that change with me, the account owner. They said they couldn't tell me, because they couldn't confirm my identity. Talk about absurd hypocrisy! They could change it for a fraudulent impostor, but couldn't tell the authentic owner how or why. 

That person on the phone said they would wave the fees and interest and send me all the statements since last XXXX when they had started sending the statements to the fraud initiator. 

Two weeks later I had not received those statements, when I got another call from Wells Fargo telling me that I owed the the service charge PLUS the fees and interest. I said the last guy said the fees and interest would be deleted because fraud blah blah blah and he said, okay, we'll send the statements again. A week later i got the statements, mailing date XX/XX/XXXX, three weeks after the first guy said they'd mail them to me. 

Of course, as now expected, this final statement said I owed the {$77.00} dollar charge PLUS INTEREST AND FEES! You can't make this XXXX  up! So I gave up. I'm not paying for costs incurred by them for fraudulently changing the address on the account without my approval. 

Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I got another call from Wells Fargo. Same XXXX. I owe them the {$77.00} plus the late fees and interest. Ridiculous. I doubt anyone can straighten this out with these totally incompetent XXXX, but what else can I do? Talking to them makes no difference at all, as they never do what they say they are going to do."
3412,"Wells Fargo is not applying credit card payments to the highest rate balance. Even after the minimum payment is covered for the lowest interest rate balance, they are first paying off 0 % interest rate balance transfer offers first and leaving higher rate purchases and cash advance balance to be paid off last. This leads to making it nearly impossible to pay off any purchases or cash advances until the promotional balance transfer offer is paid off, thereby locking the consumer into paying interest if they use the card after the balance transfer offer."
3419,I was supposed to get {$1000.00} dollars by wells fegro and I didnt receive anything I was scammed and Im struggling through this pandemic please I need it Im in debt
3420,In XX/XX/2021 I applied for a credit card and subsequent balance transfer with Wells Fargo. The card was approved but the available credit was not what I requested. I subsequent contacted Wells Fargo immediately and spoke to a representative in new applications and requested to have the credit cards closed and the balance transfer rescinded. Two different Wells Fargo representatives assured me that this would be done. Wells Fargo sent me an unwanted credit card and completed a balance transfer that I did not request and charged me {$100.00} in fees. I have spent over XXXX hours attempting to give this issue resolved. I spoke to a Representative named XXXX in customer advocacy who hung up the phone on me twice on XX/XX/2021 after i simply asked to speak to speak with a manager or another associate because he was extremely rude and unhelpful. Wells Fargo needs to closed this account and undo an unrequested balance transfer and return my {$100.00} in fees that they charged me for a service that i did not request.
3421,"My name is XXXX XXXX and I have received a letter stating that my claim has been denied because there was a similar claim last year. I do not agree with the decision as I am a victim of identity theft and two of my credit card lost/stolen within past 6 months. I know I had lost my card last year but this isn't the strong base to deny my claim. As you can see that I didn't even use this card as much throughout the year and all of a sudden there are hundreds of transactions charges in only one moth. 

Any and all of the transactions that were made from XX/XX/2018 thru XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/2018 are fraud and were not authorized by me. I would like to request the proof or documents of the investigations. Also, I would like to request to re-open and reinvestigate this claim as this is not fair with me to be reliable of paying for such a big amount which I never made transactions of. ( Totaling {$8800.00} ) I am not willing to pay a penny towards these fraud charges as I never authorized those transactions. 

Wells Fargo already have cases against them for not being reliable and I am so disappoint on both incidents. I never received a call or text when all of these fraud charges were made. 

Please contact me for any concern/questions at ( XXXX ) XXXX or via e-mail at XXXX.

3434,"On XX/XX/2018 I reported my account ending in XXXX close due to suspicious fraud on my account wells Fargo gladly assisted me with closing the account and opened up a new account for me In XX/XX/2018 I made a complaint that I think my account information has been stolen again and that someone has been using my identify as fraud there was a investigation made ( # XXXX ) for account ending in XXXX Wells Fargo notified me via email XX/XX/2018 that the investigation has been completed and that They couldn't find any valid identify theft, the credit that was applied to my account was reversed, shortly after I was emailed on XX/XX/2018 that my account was closed due to prolonged overdraft. In mid XXXX I contacted wells fargo regarding my closed checking account and also my closed credit card account, my credit card account was closed due to checking account being close ( as wells fargo says ) when I called I was told that if I want to repopen my checking account I will have to go inside of a branch and reapply for a checking account, and my credit card account can should be able to be reopen because it was closed due to checking and NOT for non payments being made. I was told I was going to receive a call back from the CCS executive office and was never notified anything I have to continuously call wells fargo for an update and every time I call they give me a run around, my recent call I spoke to another division of the CCS executive office that is open on Saturdays and was told There was a decision made on XX/XX/18 about my account not being able to reopen and the person on the phone says "" the CCS department probably didn't feel like notifying you yet '' wells fargo has bad a known history of data breach and should not be treating or blaming customers for identify theft or data breaches I am extremely upset and dissatisfied with the services wells fargo has provided"
3438,"Today ( XX/XX/22 ) my husband and I tried to buy a ring at XXXX. Wells Fargo declined the transaction 4 times even though our account is in good standing. The system texted us letting us know of the suspicious activity, we called the number they included in the text, they called us back and verified that we were the ones making the purchase. After this, Wells Fargo STILL wouldn't approve the purchase another 2 attempts. 
We were completely mortified. 
We went to the bank closest to figure out what's going on and the personal banker we spoke to said that the bank declines certain retailers because of high instances of fraud. 
It doesn't matter. All that should have been cleared up after we verified our identity TWICE at the store. 
We pay this bank between 18-25 % interest and pay our bill on time every month, they have no right to decline ANY transactions."
3441,"After not being able to locate my Wells Fargo Credit card and noticing charges on my electronic credit card statement that I did not initiate, I reported a stolen credit card to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX according to their records. I detailed the charges that I was disputing and was told by the Wells Fargo Service agent that adjustments would be made to my account but not finalized until their "" fraud claims '' department had the opportunity to investigate. I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that stated "" our research shows that you made a transaction after you reported that your card was lost or stolen and used without your authorization. Because of this we can not accept your claim. '' The letter also stated that "" If you have any questions or you would like to request copies of supporting documentation used in our research, please call us at XXXX, Monday-Friday, XXXX XXXX   to XXXX Central Time. '' It was signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX, Senior Vice President Claims Assistance Center Credit Card Fraud Claims. 

My complaint with Wells Fargo contains three major components : 1 )  The disputed charges are not mine. XXXX  ( XXXX ) - {$620.00} XXXX  ( XXXX ) - {$620.00} XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) - {$36.00} 2 ) On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted the Claims Assistance Center twice at the above listed phone number. The first time was at XXXX PST.  The second time was at XXXXPST. I requested time stamps associated with the actual times the disputed charges occurred. On the first phone call a supervisor was not available to access that information because the supervisors do not work the same hours as listed on the letter mentioned above. On the second call I spoke with a representative ( XXXX ) who gave me a set of time stamps ( with the assistance from a supervisor ) that seemed very inaccurate. The times that she provided were times when the merchants where these disputed charges took place are not even open for business. I requested a to speak with supervisor and was told that the supervisor was not available and that I would be contacted by one in the next 24-48 hours. I received a call from a supervisor ( XXXX ) at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked him to confirm the time stamps that I had received from XXXX earlier that morning. He provided me with time stamps that were completely different from the ones XXXX claimed. Again, some of which were when the merchants were not even open for business. Even more concerning were the times that the Wells Fargo Claims Assistance Center claimed the disputed charges were initiated, were times that I was either at my work or at my kid 's school for parent teacher conferences. Both which are verifiable by the Operation 's Chief of my Fire Department or the Principal of my children 's school respectively. 

Chief XXXX XXXX - ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Department City of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX- XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX , CA XXXX Principal XXXX XXXX - ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , CA XXXX When I asked for documentation of the time stamps they provided, they denied my request. XXXX said that they were "" proprietary documents '' and were not available in written to the customer. Since their reasoning for denying my claim relies completely on the sequence of purchases, I need accurate and detailed information in order to respond to the denial letter. I was not able to obtain either. PLEASE LISTEN TO THE PHONE CALLS - THEY ARE RECORDED AND WILL FURTHER SUPPORT THE BASIS OF MY COMPLAINT 3 )  The process to communicate and gather information to intelligently respond to this denied claim with the Claims Assistance Center is extremely difficult and severely lacked consistency in the information they did provide me. 



Having been I credit card customer with Wells Fargo since XXXX and standing by them through all of the bad press regarding questionable business practices, I am completely disappointed with their support. Not only was my claim denied based upon information that, as a consumer, I am not able to access, but also the fact that the resolution process for a denied claim with the Claims Assistance Center is about as user-unfriendly of a process I have experienced. On the advice of the Claims Assistant Center representative who I spoke with the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, I went to a local branch and sat down with a banker later that afternoon ( XXXX ) to request the "" supporting documentation '' mentioned in the claim denial letter, through that banker with a phone call to the Claims Assistance center. According to that Claims Assistant Center representative that I spoke with earlier that day, I could receive the supporting documentation immediately once the banker at the local branch was verified and made the request on my behalf. Otherwise, I would have to wait 7-10 business days to receive the "" supporting documentation '' by mail. The banker at the local branch located at XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX was very accomodating and called the number listed on the denial letter from the Claims Assistance Center. He was told that Wells Fargo Claims Assistance Center policy prohibits them from fulfilling the request. I was told the case was "" reopened '' but they could not provide any additional information. 

Just another example of how frustrating and labor intensive the pursuit of accurate information and procedure are regarding procedure and data relating to the disputed charges. The inconsistency of the information and procedures have resulted in a significant amount of hours of my personal time spent trying to sort through the details from the time my card was stolen until the card was frozen. I am not even able to discuss these details with anyone directly involved in resolving this issue ... ie the investigation team that denied the disputed charge claim. Wells Fargo has been consistently inconsistent with the handling of this case and as mentioned earlier I could not be more disappointed with Wells Fargo 's approach to working with me to resolve. 

The disputed charges are not mine. PLEASE LISTEN TO THE RECORDED PHONE CALLS. THE PROCEDURAL INCONSISTENCIES ARE PRONOUNCED AND THE TIME STAMPS NOT ACCURATE"
3442,I attempted to open up a credit card with Wells Fargo in XXXX XXXX  2017 and was denied due to my XXXX status.
3443,Since XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX my account has been withdrawn of - {$400.00}. I have never authorized them to let payments go through when there isnt any monies in the account. I have complained and I am willing to make arrangements if need be. But I have accessed overdraft fees and Im not willing to pay that.

3449,I was listed as an Authorized user on a my mothers Wells Fargo Credit card. I have asked several time to me removed form this account with no help from Wells Fargo and them also telling me it was to bad your on and can't be removed. My Mother has since claimed Bankruptcy and that card was filed in it and has been closed. I have ask since then also to have the information removed with not help what so ever.
3450,"We were purchasing carpet from XXXX and they use credit from Wells Fargo Bank. I gave my information to the sales associate who in turn gave my information to Wells Fargo. Shortly afterwards, a Wells Fargo associate called and spoke with me. I was denied credit for the carpet purchase according to the Wells Fargo associate due to the inability of Wells Fargo to authenticate my identity. This interaction happened on XX/XX/18. In the mail, I received a denial letter stating the inability to authenticate my identity ( the applicant ) and instructed to contact XXXX XXXX. My complaint is with Wells Fargo ; specifically, why did I take a credit hit, if in fact Wells Fargo could not authenticate my identity? It doesn't make sense for any business who claims an inability to authenticate a potential customer 's id to then be able to run a credit check and then the customer takes a hit to their credit score."
3451,"THIS IS NOT A DUPLICATE COMPLAINT This is a follow up to complaint XXXX Wells Fargo responded to my initial complaint but it did not address my main concern. A balance transfer was completed without my permission, without me requesting it and they are claiming that when I requested a balance increase that I did and that is incorrect. 

I replied to the their response with this : Hi, Wells Fargo response has incorrect information. When I requested a credit limit increase to {$13000.00}, I never asked for the balance transfer to be automatically done. I never gave the representative information on my XXXX or XXXX account for Wells Fargo to one, know the balances ; two, know my account numbers ; three, know which companies I had credit cards with. I understand that balances and company names are available on my credit report but where did you get my account numbers? Why was there a balance transfer that I never requested? 

MY ISSUE IS NOT RESOLVED. THEY ARE DENYING XXXX  OUT MY BALANCE. I want them to be held responsible for continuing to do things for customer that their customer did not request. They continue to do this and have recently gotten out of a huge scandal but they are not stopping."
3453,"I have a credit card XXXX  issued through Wells Fargo Bank with a credit balance of {$12000.00}. I had recently issued a payment to the card on XX/XX/XXXX to which totaled {$8000.00}. This was reflected and shown on the account transaction list through my online banking account, the following business day. About a month later, I attempted to charge the card again with a smaller transaction amount to find that the place of business I was attempting to charge with, noted the card was declined. To what was my knowledge, credit was more than available due to keeping up on payments and seeing them apply on my online account. The balance on the card at the time said of transaction, was close to only {$2500.00} - XXXX, leaving much left on the credit line issued to the card. The transaction attempted to be charged only totaled {$1400.00}. The declined message continued to be received and thus led to calling Wells Fargo directly to check and see if there was a transaction limit newly placed or what the issue might be. My wife and I were transferred between multiple people and departments and became extremely frustrated when we were told that the payment made on XX/XX/XXXX in the total of {$8000.00} was NOT applied to the account and was being held for 30 days. Asking for reasons as to why this was being held and reasons why I was not notified of this hold in funds issued by the bank, prior to me having to call almost a month later, was left unanswered. The representatives could not provide an answer as to where the money was or why it was being held and noted they could not release it until the 30 day mark hit, which was noted to be on XX/XX/XXXX. They advised they typically have a button to click in order to request a release sooner then noted and that this was not available at the time of our call as well. Further, more transfers took place and I finally reached a case manager who was still unable to assist in providing any information whatsoever other than that the RISK department placed the hold on the payment issued to my account and the only way to get a resolution was to open a case claim and we would then have to wait another 7-10 business days for a response at minimum. The funds were finally released as noted on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I find this being a poor way of doing any kind of business given that there was absolutely no notification on this hold of payment and no reasons as to why it was being held. The payment was made online through the Wells Fargo online banking account and was issued through my personal bank account, to which was previously verified by Wells Fargo, for processing etc. per their regulations and protocols. The verification was done through their trial deposit and credit system. These test transactions they issued were reported as requested by Wells Fargo and thus having our account being verified for ease of online payment ability PRIOR to the payments being issued and withheld. Given no notice on the hold for payment, this could have caused many issues in expecting funds to be available and not having them truly be without any knowledge of such. I believe each consumer should be notified if a payment they willingly issue on time or prior to dates due is being withheld and not applied to the account as shown directly on the consumer end. When I see the payment reflected on my account, this shows me it has been applied to the account balance. Why it was not notified of being held and why it's been reflected on the client end while still being held against the account, I believe is wrongful practice. I am reporting this issue and experience as I find this to be a huge issue that may affect others as well. I have been advised by an alternate banking institution that this practice is not fully legal and that the consumer must be notified upon a hold of any payment or debit from an account through a banking institution and that partial funds should have been released if anything prompted a hold for risk factors up to a certain amount. The funds were being held directly by Wells Fargo and not third parties. I have yet to receive an answer as to why the funds were held or any light shed to the situation and having to wait yet another so many business days to obtain any answers. Further disclosure was received that we should have some sort of update by XX/XX/XXXX as per attachment."
3457,I believe Wells Fargo makes the payment process very difficult and tedious in order to generate late fees. I don't think their process is intuitive and their technology is outdated. Setting up recurring payments is notoriously difficult.
3462,"I had an XXXX System installed by an authorized Carrier installer that offered 36 Months zero percent financing through Wells Fargo. When I enrolled I was told that if I pay down my balance the monthly amount would change based on the balance and remainder of time. about my 3rd payment I payed down more that half my balance but the monthly charge stayed the same. I contacted Wells Fargo and they stated the they do not change the monthly payment. They stated this is NOT a credit card but my statement says the credit card. And they sent me an actual credit card. This is deceptive and wrong! 

I would like to get a copy of my recorded phone conversation and the inception of this account."
3464,"I had a Wells Fargo Secured Credit Card that was secured by funds provided by me. About 5 months ago I started going through a financial hardship and Wells Fargo closed my account, added excessive fees, and now they've sent the account into collections for over {$150.00} -- of which are all fees. This had adversely affected my credit profile and I was never offered the opportunity to make a payment arrangement or restructure that debt."
3466,"Applied to Wells Fargo for a active cash card which has a cash refund plus has a cash back for charges. Was approved immediately. When I received the card it was a reflect card which has no benefits. Called Wells Fargo many times but was always transferred with no results. This is a bait and switch scam. I do not want anything further from Wells Fargo, I am now only reporting this scam."
3467,"I got a text on my phone this morning that my bank WF -- -- -informed me of unauthorized charges from XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/20. There were two charges on {$100.00} and the other $ XXXX {$200.00}.

3469,It was during 2020 during the COVID 19 pandemic I hadn't used the card in a few months but had always paid in full on time when I had used it. in XXXX of they decided that I was a credit risk ( my husband had carried a balance on one of his non wells Fargo credit cards while making the minimum payments ) and shut down my credit card and stole hundreds of dollars of rewards that I had earned to that point

3471,"I applied for a Wells Fargo credit card on line for a balance transfer from my XXXX account. When I applied on line the response I received stated my application was under review and someone would contact me shortly. I never heard back and contacted Wells Fargo at XXXX to find out the status of my application as well as the terms and conditions of a potential credit card, on XX/XX/XXXX and again on XX/XX/XXXX. Another week went by and went I went to my online banking, a credit card account had been opened with a balance transfer of {$5000.00} and a fee of {$140.00} on XX/XX/XXXX! I called Wells extremely upset and advise I never authorized this credit card as I had called to obtain the terms and conditions of the card and they had violated regulation B as no notice of approval had been issued to me. They said someone from the complaint department would be in touch. Still hearing nothing I received an email on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX at XXXX stating she was from the executive office and was working on my complaint and I would hear something by XX/XX/XXXX. Still hearing nothing by that date I had contacted her on XX/XX/XXXX and she indicated because Wells Fargo sent me a notice that I had been approved they would not refund the balance transfer fee. I urged her that I was dissatisfied and had never received a letter, and why hadnt they called me back, I would be paying off the card and closing it out in the next 3 weeks and I had moved residences and I had been a long time customer of Wells, as a courtesy I want the {$140.00} fee refunded. XXXX stated that because a letter was mailed, there was nothing further. I am appalled at the compliance violation and lack of professionalism with Wells Fargo thinking they can just issue credit without confirmation from the customer. Please try to recoup this balance transfer fee for me. Thank you."
3475,I had {$59000.00} of fraudulent charges charged to my Wells Fargo Visa debit card and I disputed the transactions. Wells Fargo just let me know they denied the dispute. I will not let this go because I did not make these transactions and its my life savings.
3476,"Well Fargo Bank, N.A. is violating my right as consumer this a fraudulent account # XXXX i provided Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. with a FTC identity theft report also a Police report they ignored my dispute.. Wells Fargo also violated my rights Per the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( a ), it is mandatory by federal law to verify through physical verification of the original documents, contracts, arrangement, obligation, pledge or promises written or, sign by the consumer all accounts you post on a credit report. Otherwise, any and everyone paying for your reporting services, business or work that could fax, mail or e-mail in a fraudulent or deceitful account or report this account was electronically created.."
3480,"I would like to reopen the case # XXXX because Wells Fargo bank is NOT investigating and looking to see if the charge on my credit card is valid. I had a service that was paid but I did not get the service, I raised the issue multiple times with WF and every time they come up with a different reason not to investigate the case. Every time they assign a person to the case and they disappear for a week and then comes with different answer. First they said I received the service and the clinic sent them agreement with the procedure crossed out so WF will not see it, they never investigated why the clinic crossed out the service instead they deny the dispute. I explained to them that the clinic crossed out because they denied my treatment and they called the police to me so I did NOT get correction or followup on the procedure which they crossed out. After informing Wells Fargo and wake them up about the clinic behavior they disappears for a few days and then another person came from WF saying because it is medical treatment then we are not investigating it, so why then they allow people to use credit card for medical treatment, doe not make sense at all. In another response from WF they said we will give you {$300.00} so they can avoid the dispute and avoid spending the time and effort to investigate but I paid {$1200.00} not {$300.00}. There is customer rights under credit act and if the service is bad or not done then a refund must be issued but WF does not follow the credit card customer rights, I need my money back, I have police report, I have proofs or service that was not done and also I have proofs of WF not doing his job in looking after people who charge credit cards without doing the service. 
I attached the police report shows that the clinic stopped me from going to the clinic to correct and followup on my bad XXXX. I also attached two certified XXXX  stating that the procedure has to be redone."
3482,"On XX/XX/18 while on vacation, Wells Fargo closed our current account without notifying us and "" upgraded '' our credit card without our notification or request."
3486,"Wells Fargo has charged me {$88.00} for "" INTEREST CHARGE ON PURCHASES '' on my credit card balance that has a promotional balance transfer APR of 0 % until XX/XX/2023. However, I never made any purchases with this credit card. So why is Wells Fargo charging me purchase interest when I never made any purchases since the opening of this credit card? 

This is unnecessary fee interest and I was wrongly charged for it as I do have a promotional balance APR of 0 % until XX/XX/2023. 

The latest statement has been attached to this case for reference and evidence."
3487,"On XXXX/XXXX/2022, I filed a dispute over the phone with Wells Fargo Bank in the amount of {$440.00}. The XXXX & XXXX XXXX is defective from a 3rd party ( XXXX ), but I had to deal with the manufacturer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). XXXX told me I had to call XXXX & XXXX, not them. I purchased it with my XXXX debit card. I also filed a XXXX complaint against XXXX & XXXX about this, but because XXXX got the money, they're who XXXX went after. I told XXXX to contact XXXX and XXXX, not XXXX. XXXX doesn't deal with defective firearm warranty issues ; the manufacturer ( XXXX & XXXX ) does. XXXX only has a 24-hr policy about returns and told me to call XXXX & XXXX when I told them I had a problem using this weapon for the first time on XXXX/XXXX/2022. Today, Wells Fargo Bank called XXXX and they should've told my bank to contact XXXX & XXXX, not them. Everybody is sticking me with a defective weapon that could injure me ( perhaps fatally ) if that slide sticks open during discharge. 

Not only did XXXX & XXXX fail to acknowledge I sent them a defective weapon, they merely closed the stuck slide without telling me anything. Ran it through some imaginary tests and wanted me to send it back again to reproduce the problem when you can't force that slide to stick at-will. I told them it had never been discharged by me, everybody attending that class saw it, and XXXX & XXXX sent it back to me after closing the stuck slide ... w/o saying what they did. I asked for replacement, not a quick fix. I don't trust they had a test for why the slide was stuck, because of their refusal to say what was wrong in the first place. My last point of defense was Wells Fargo Bank, because XXXX XXXX XXXX doesn't have a registered agent in my State ( GA ), and I would have to travel to XXXX, MA for a small claims lawsuit. I'd have to sue for air-travel, hotel, and car rental as well as the {$440.00} + court costs. 

Wells Fargo Bank gave me some nonsense and denied my claim, because they didn't follow all the way through to the manufacturer of the firearm. I don't care who got the money, XXXX doesn't deal with purchases beyond me picking it up from the XXXX and Wells Fargo Bank has very lousy research methods. I told them over the phone that XXXX knew nothing about the XXXX complaint I filed against XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I did provide correspondence going back and forth between myself and XXXX & XXXX, not XXXX. XXXX was quick to deny my claim, just because they could. Even if I find another bank, this transaction happened with them, so I'm filing this complaint against XXXX who has a very bad habit of doing lousy research and poor resolutions that always benefits the business, not their customers. This is not the 1st time they've done this, including a claim against a local branch that didn't know what they were doing. 

I asked XXXX to refund the {$440.00} so I can replace this firearm since XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are being completely uncooperative, lack integrity, and are dumping me with a firearm I'm afraid to use. Before I found out the firearm was defective, I purchased a couple of holsters and ammunition. These guns manufacturers get away with selling defective weapons because everybody in this country allows them to do so. I'm hoping CFPB doesn't send me into the jaws of XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and Wells Fargo Bank. PLEASE FORCE XXXX TO DO THE RIGHT THING and don't pass the buck. If you can get the others to do the same, I'm fine with that as well. I just want this to stop going in circles and my bank to do the right thing ; not the quickest thing. 

If you send this to XXXX or XXXX & XXXX, they will play the same games all over again, so please don't do that. "" Policy '' isn't warranty or safety, and none of those companies want to make sure I'm safe. 

I don't want to attach my debit card number on this website. They should be able to get to case # XXXX without it."
3489,"Wells Fargo provide the checking and savings accounts to XXXX and encourage people to set up a direct deposit. But no XXXX neither Wells Fargo allow any other bank to use my money for free as they do, neither they allow me to use my money that should be available to me immediately and it is not. I struggled to add XXXX account as external account to XXXX XXXX, instead XXXX keeps my money with Wells Fargo. 

On the other hand Wells Fargo denied my application for a credit card. 

I already lost up to {$1000.00} with XXXX resistance to transfer my money virtually at my request. They will keep my money on hold for a week instead of transferring immediately. Sometimes my threats to complain to CFPB helps to speed it up for next day, but not always."
3491,My Wells Fargo credit card account was closed withouht any warning. The car was was an always had been in good standing with the bank. I had ALWAYS made payments on time. I spoke to 6 WF reps on XX/XX/12 regarding this matter. Wells Fargo credit card services even verified that my account was in good status. I was told that my card was closed because I had another account that was closed years ago by Wells Fargo was not in good standing. ALL of my credit card rewards were erased. I was never warned that his may happen. I have been robbed of all of my rewards.I feel that Wells Fargo has tricked me and closed my account simply so they can continue to add illegal interest on my account. I was deceived and prayed upon.
3493,"Had a card with Wells Fargo. They placed me on Covid-19 payment assistance. But never sent me any information about the duration of the assistance or when I would be coming off the assistance. But to make sure a payment was posted, I mailed them a {$30.00} check even during my period of payment assistance. Howeve, this payment was never applied. Instead, they removed me from covid assistance without notice, causing a late payment on my credit report. I closed my account to get away from this shady company."
3494,"My father, XXXX XXXX XXXX and I have an account together. XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX broke into our home, stealing the keys, checkbooks, banking statements and other personal information.

Wells Fargo bank has allowed XXXX XXXX, whom is not a legal guardian, who does nothing for My father, who is not his daughter, to access personal banking information. These people are not even his children and they are not included on birth cerificates. Wells Fargo was supposed to wait until my father got home from rehabilitation to receive a new card. Wells Fargo also changed an account number that they were not supposed to. my father was shocked when he heard that the XXXX number was changed. My father and I are on several accounts together. You can call to certify that at this time. We need to sign, additional, documents."

Wells Fargo opened my card in XXXX I was not notified and incurred fees on the account. card reckoned again in a XXXX and now Wells Fargo is stating I owe a XXXX balance but reported to my report different amounts and is not trying to resolve my issue.
3498,"I submitted a dispute to my credit card company for a charge from a moving broker : XXXX XXXX XXXX. The disputed transaction ID is XXXX with a post date of XX/XX/XXXX. The amount of the dispute is {$720.00} I disputed this charge because the company the broker hired to complete the move never transported my belongings to the requested destination. The broker did not take responsibility for this this. My belongings were taken to a different state entirely, a few thousands miles from their intended destination. In short, it turned out to be a scam. 
My credit card company opened the dispute but never contacted me to submit proof of non-delivery, evidence, etc. They dispute department then closed the dispute in the merchant 's favor. I contacted my credit card to find out why this had happened and was told that they, my credit card 's dispute department, lost many disputes to this company as this merchant was experienced at dodging chargebacks. My credit card company sent me the rebuttal statement from the merchant, but it was not even from the same merchant from where the charge originated. The moving broker charged my card but the statement was not from this company at all, but from the moving company. Additionally, the statement contained false information, including stating that I picked up my belongings on XX/XX/XXXX without providing proof of this. I do have proof of the date I picked them up, which was two months later than what the merchant had stated. I sent this to my credit card company. Additionally, I have receipts ( with same credit card ) placing me at a different location on XX/XX/XXXX, making it impossible for the merchant 's statement to be true. I submitted all of this plus the evidence showing that the service I had paid for was not completed and that the merchant 's statement had false information, but this was disregarded. Numerous people that I spoke to at Wells Fargo told me that, due to the manner in which this case was originally handled and subsequently closed, there no chance that the dispute department would win the case. I spent several hours speaking to 11 different employees in the dispute department, but ultimately while they admitted that the validity of the dispute was not in question, they had already lost and therefore the case would not be ruled in my favor. Their mishandling of the case should not fall upon me, the customer, but they have rebilled me for this charge. 
I am including the dispute history provided by Wells Fargo which includes a statement that the merchant 's response is invalid as they failed to provide proof that the service was provided. The merchant 's response is also included, which includes numerous false statements in regards to the moving contract, a credit being issued ( no credit was issued ) and that I simply did not want to wait to have the items delivered. The moving contract actually states that delivery was to take place within 30 days. In an attempt to resolve the issue with the merchant first, I actually waited two months to pick up the items. I have included this part of the contract as well as receipts of when I actually picked up my belongings."

I initially chose XXXX XXXX for {$83.00} and provided my credit card, he looked again and found another date on the XXXX for {$140.00}. I accepted the XXXX for {$140.00}. 

When I use my credit card on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a decline on my card. I contacted the credit card company on the XXXX, they explained there were charges of {$83.00}, {$140.00}, and pending charge of {$220.00} from the Airline company. I explain the {$220.00} appeared to be a duplication of the {$83.00} and {$140.00}. I told them the {$140.00} I don't dispute so they would remove the {$83.00} charge and contact the Airline about the {$220.00} charge to close out the process within 24hrs. On XX/XX/XXXX, my card was declined again. Call the credit card department and they transferred me to the resolution department. I talked to a representative named ( XXXX ) and asked her to assist in resolving this pending charge of {$220.00} which she agree appeared to be a mistake. She stated she could not call the merchant but I could call myself if they don't take it off I had to wait 15 days before action could be taken and I might be charged an overcharge. Because of the lack of assistance I received I requested her supervisor ( XXXX ), he was professional and called the merchant and after 15 minutes came back and said they never answered his call. They told me there was nothing they could do until the Airline company release the pending charge although the pending charge was 5 days holding on my account."

Neither the account terms and conditions provided when i opened the account, nor the periodic billing statement, indicates any restriction on the number of times a customer is permitted to make an electronic payment from a non Wells Fargo depository account. 

I find this practice to be deceptive and seems to be a means to compel customers to open Wells Fargo depository accounts. 

I have attached a screen shot of the message that appeared in Wells Fargo online banking that prohibited me from making a payment and a copy of a recent account statement that does not disclose any restrictions on making payments."

3517,"The facts show the following violations occurred : 1. The Merchant was trading regulated financial products without the required license ; they employed persons that were providing financial services without required license. There is the possibility that in this case, your firm had joint knowledge ( is an accessory ) in trading regulated financial products without required license. 
2. There is the possible neglect of your duty to actively prevent fraud and to identify abnormal payment patterns.

3. There is the possible neglect by your firm of the legal provisions for measures against money laundering.

4. There is the possible involvement of your firm to the theft/fraud that has been committed. 

1. Facts of the Case I was solicited by a merchant, XXXX XXXX XXXX, operating under the web address XXXX XXXX  to wire funds to a false and fictitious trading account. The merchant is part of a global network of Cybercrime known as the binary option and falsified trading scam. I have accessed the Internet-based platform of the Merchant available under XXXX XXXX To the best of our knowledge, the Merchant did not provide a contract ; however, the terms and conditions contained on the site are intended to govern the relationship and responsibilities of the parties. Therefore, all information on the website is relevant for determination of the services and the rights and obligations of the parties. The Merchant claimed to be a financial services provider dealing with regulated financial products, such as CFDs, indices, binary options, commodities etc. In addition, the officers and employees of the Merchant are also presented as experienced brokers ( a designation that requires licensing ). Evidently, it is advertising and promoting itself as a provider of financial services and is trying to influence third parties decisions to undertake financial commitments and to invest in the offered financial products based upon the information provided by the Merchant on its website. All those activities require the Merchant to possess the required licensing. The website of the Merchant contains clear statements that its team consists of professional brokers. Persons claiming to be such licensed brokers apparently contacted third parties and communicated with them the possibility of making an investment, which is strictly prohibited by the law if there is a lack of the respective license. Only a licensed broker can contact persons with the intention to assist them regarding where and how to invest their money. To be able to act as an investment intermediary, or broker, or similar i.e., to have the capacity to offer financial advice and to provide access to regulated financial products to third parties one must be registered with the relevant supervisory authorities. It is the common rule that financial products such as CFDs, indices, binary options, stocks and commodities exists, are regulated, not only in the XXXX, in which the Merchant claims to be located, but also in most of the rest of the world, including in United States ( where our client resides and where your money services business is registered ). However, the Merchant is NOT licensed to offer regulated financial products nor to provide financial advice to third parties such as our client. There are warnings from Government Regulatory Authorities for operating and providing financial services without having the proper required licensing. The Merchant claimed to have the ability to trade regulated financial products. In truth, the merchant provides a fictitious and malicious software which does not execute any trades and is not connected to any recognized exchanges. It is manipulated by the merchant to exhibit its own desired figures. The merchant has left a trail of victims who have fallen for a sophisticated and well-crafted scam and that have lost their entire life savings. The offering of financial services without the mandatory required licensing is considered illegal and fraudulent. Acting in good faith and in full reliance on the website information, our client was instructed in writing by the merchant to wire funds to your firm, XXXX XXXX XXXX to an account at XXXX XXXX."

My personal accounts, IRA, vehicles and credit cards are all with Wells Fargo and have never had any problems in which risk management would become involved. I am also a former employee that left the company in good standing. I called credit card services to resolve the matter and after 4 different team members in different departments deflecting my concerns and passing me around, the supervisor left the conversation before explaining it to the next person and that 's when I officially gave up on Wells Fargo. They essentially punished me for using The credit I have earned over the years and their associated balances, yet they closed my account for the exact opposite reasons.A customer of 20 years. here is no logical explanation for this decision and none of the employees could explain anything other than what my letter stated. I explained to each associate that I have been a very loyal customer for over 15 years, maintain an excellent relationship and keep the card for emergencies. I feel that am being cheated for no reason since there is no negative history on my tiny credit card account. Of course every representative said they would be more than happy to submit my application for a new credit account that would negatively impact my credit report, but give the company another sale. This is when I became concerned and decided to report WF. They are abusing their customer 's loyalty as well as their financial states once again.

One manager told me that I can have excess payments ( once the minimum is met ) applied to the higher interest rate balance. I said that supposed to happen automatically. He told me to go into a branch and make a direct payment to that balance. ( But you can clearly see that I've paid in excess of what is due on the "" advance '' ... but I'm charged an incredibly high interest rate for cash advances, as we all are. ) So they're not doing what's required by law ... and they're charging ME for it. 

I called back later that same night, and a different manager told me that I'd have to pay the balance off in total to remove that part of the bill. NO. No, I don't. I quoted the Card Act directly, and explained that this has been a violation perpetuated by WELLS FARGO since XX/XX/2018.

The XXXX advertising the Wells Fargo XXXX credit card is a fraudulent scheme, in my opinion. 

As a result, I, in my opinion after careful research believe that the source of this Wells Fargo scam, the XXXX, selling the XXXX XXXX credit card on the Wells Fargo secure banking website is possibly the source of some spam email I have been receiving, of which I logged an FTC complaint. 

The spam email I received and reported to the reportphish website at Wells Fargo Bank is coming from coverage, XXXX XXXX and the marketer on the XXXX Life ecommerce.com website is offering XXXX XXXX, {$250000.00} XXXX XXXX at {$15.00} per month.

It appears to be the XXXX at Hotels credit card using Wells Fargo Bank, of which I am a depositor FDIC insured for XXXX Thus this is a Wells Fargo Bank scheme with the XXXX in charge and my money is FDIC insured at Wells Fargo Bank. 

Is this how a bank operates on United States soil?"
3529,"I have a loan with Wf Bank Na. I have always made my payments on time. For some reason I realized that there was a late payment on my credit report. As you can see, I have always had a stellar payment record with this company. I tried contacting both XXXX, XXXX, XXXX   and Wf Bank Na with no successful resolution. XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX were reporting me late. There was definitely an error on their part. I was never 30 days late XX/XX/2018."
3530,Wells Fargo will not report credit card account to all three bureaus. The company is only reporting to XXXX only.
3534,Someone needs to call me from the corporate offices of Wells Fargo about the staff in your applications department. I have attempted repeatedly to get ahold of them and they have not let me speak to them and I keep getting agents off shore.
3544,"XXXX had charged my account cause my account to go in to overdraft. I contacted XXXX to get the funds reversed and they did and then reached out to Wells Fargo to notify them about the situation. The agent I spoke to advise me to wait for the refund to go through then call back. Two days later, I reached out back to Wells Fargo to let them know that the XXXX transaction was refunded and that they need to refund me the overdraft fee so I can put my money in my account. The agent that I was speaking to was rude stating that the fee was unable to be. After arguing and explain the the situation about the fee, she finally realized what had happened and reversed the fee. Causing me to wait another day to deposit money in to my account to make the my payment and that next day I got a email stating that my credit report had update with a missed payment. I am seeking help with my situation due to the fact that it was not my fault that my account was overdraft, not allowing me to make my payment for more then a week while I was attempting to make a payment."
3545,"I applied for a store credit card at XXXX XXXX in XXXX, MD which is serviced by Wells Fargo. They claimed that this card was no interest for the first 12 months. Over the course of the next year I made payments as agreed upon and at the last 3 months paid 600+ to make sure that the balance would be paid off before interest was applied on XX/XX/2018. 

I sent my bill pay form XXXX as usual and the check was received by XX/XX/XXXX for {$660.00} which was over the balance by XXXXcents. I logged on severally but the payment was not applied. I called my bank to check what the problem was and they provided a receipt that payment was sent and received on time. 
That is when Wells Fargo reps started calling me for payment and I told them i had already paid. I have all the call logs of this. They sent me to another department and i have been working with 'XXXX '' from XXXX XXXX XXXX. She asked me to fax her proof of payment and I did, twice. 

This morning about a week later, XXXX called and said they would not honor my payment because they did not cash it. I got to my computer, paid {$660.00} which was the original outstanding balance and let her know that I would file a complain with the banks ( wells Fargo, XXXX ) and with the Federal Trade Commission as this seems odd that only the last payment went missing and i used the same method to send payment. 

I have also asked Wells Fargo to close the account as this is my 2nd time trying business with them unsuccessfully. I believe this is unfair practice and if the account was truly no interest the payment would have been cashed without issue. I believe because i was able to pay off the balance, wells fargo "" lost "" the final check so as to apply $ 700+ interest on my account. 

I am writing to seek assistance in closing this account and in making sure that they do not have detrimental effect on my credit report. 

Thank you for your time and assistance on this, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX"
3548,"I received a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the mail on XX/XX/2022 that I never applied for. I called the company the same day and was informed of 2 charges totally {$9600.00} on the card. These charges were made for rent in XXXX XXXX  state and I live in XXXX. I told the company that I did not apply for the card. A fraud investigation has been started and Wells Fargo is "" researching possible unauthorized transactions ''. I have also filed a police report with the town that I reside in."
3551,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to a teller at Wells Fargo branch number XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( banker XXXX : XXXX, XXXX : XXXX ), about how I could obtain a line of credit. I needed one because I am new to the country and have no credit history here. It is really important for me to build a credit score. I have an XXXX XXXX   which means it is not easy for me to get a credit card. The teller told me that since I didn't have a green card, he couldn't give me a credit card, but that Wells Fargo has a "" secure credit card '' and I could make a deposit. If I paid my bills on time and didn't spend too much, they could approve me for a line of credit in either 6 months or a year. So I deposited {$1000.00} ( he suggested {$500.00} ). After 6 months I returned and asked him how the application was going. He told me that it could take a year, so I should wait. Six months after that time, I  returned and asked about my application again ( it was XX/XX/XXXX ). He said that Wells Fargo only approves applications in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and that I would either get my approval very soon, or in XX/XX/XXXX. I went to the bank around a month later to withdraw some cash and an employee at the branch told me that I would never get approval for the secure credit card because of my visa status. So I called Wells Fargo and talked to an employee about my case and they confirmed that I would never get a credit card. I told that person on the phone that XXXX had lied to me more than once about this issue and even convinced me to deposit {$1000.00} in order to get a line of credit. On the phone they had me complete a complaint form. I was forwarded to a different employee on the phone who told me I would receive a phone call about my case after 1 business day. When I got the call, the person on the line apologized for the misinformation and told me that I could never have a line of credit. So then, I went to the bank ( around a week later ) to speak to XXXX. He wasn't in that day, so I spoke to a different employee who agreed that I would never get a credit card with Wells Fargo and that if I close my account, my credit history will be negatively impacted. When I asked to downgrade my limit, he said the lowest amount would be {$300.00} ( less than a third of my investment ). 

I applied for that for that card in XX/XX/XXXX at the encouragement of a Wells Fargo employee. I waited 19 months to get an approval based on misinformation by that same employee. In that time I could have invested that same money on my XXXX XXXX  card where I get points, credit history, and miles. Wells Fargo has wasted my money, my time, and my consumer loyalty. An apology and my {$1000.00} doesn't compensate for this year of wasted time and money. The problem is 1. I  was lied to by XXXX in order to get me to buy a secure credit card. 2. I went several times to inquire about my application and he continued to lie to me. 3. He was using my immigration status against me. 4. When I realized what he was doing and asked to close my account, I was told that I shouldn't because it would lower my credit score. 5. As a law-abiding resident and businessman, that kind of abuse of power is disgusting and disgraceful."
3553,I have had a wells Fargo secured credit card for over 2 years. Paid my Bill 's over the amount requested and never received an upgrade. Their excuse is I haven't updated my salary and I paid 2 days later than the time once. Everytime I call I update my salary. The manager I've spoken to is a completely rude and doesnt care about upgrading anything. I asked several times when the upgrade would happen and for 2 almost 3 years inXX/XX/2019will be 3 years. I have 2 cards that's been upgraded to unsecured and close to $ 15k and I still have this measly little {$400.00} card. They lie about the entire upgrade process.
3555,"-- -- -- -- -- Forwarded message -- -- -- -- -- : Complaint against Wells Fargo. 





This is a complaint with Wells Fargo Bank regarding my Visa Credit Card number. 


I don't have the exact dates for the first two times this same problem came up on my account but for the third time I do. 

On XX/XX/2018, there was a deposit into my credit card account for {$300.00} that was made in branch in cash. The number for that transaction is : # XXXX. I called the bank ( Wells Fargo ) and explained the mistake was not my deposit. Finally, on XX/XX/2018, the deposit was reversed and that transaction number is : # XXXX. This was the third time this same amount has been posted to my account in error and takes at least 4 - 6 weeks to resolve it. 

Now on XX/XX/2018, there was posted to my same credit card a "" Payment Reversal '' in the amount of {$280.00}. The number for that transaction is : # XXXX. I have called the bank several times trying to get this resolved as this payment is not mine to begin with. I have no idea where it came from and why it is added into my balance. I have explained this in detail to several different people in Wells Fargo, at their customer service number : XXXX. Each time I have called this number and explained the issue, I am transferred to several other areas that are suppose to resolve this issue. I get the same response : Someone will get back to me and get this issue resolved as they recognize this is a banking error. 

I have yet to be called back, sent an email, or rectified my account with this {$280.00} payment reversal. The last call was on Saturday, XX/XX/2018 and I was assured I would receive resolution on XX/XX/2018. I have yet to receive that call and the {$280.00} payment reversal is still on my account."
3556,"Step 1 : What is this complaint about? - Payment allocation Step 2 : What type of problem are you having? - payments are not being applied towards  the older balance ( purchase balance ) on my credit card. 

Step 3 : What happened? As of XX/XX/XXXX my credit card purchase balance was {$1100.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I did a balance transfer of {$3000.00} to my Wells Fargo credit card, per their promotion of 0 % until XX/XX/XXXX on balance transfers. Since then I made the payments as follows, to pay off the balance accumulating interest. However, my payments are not being applied entirely to the oldest balance, which is accumulating interest. Rather, they are applying part of my payment towards the promotional balance and part towards the purchase balance accumulating interest. With the payment shown below ; i should have paid the balance accumulating interest off, but that is not what is happening, and i believe these are bad business practices, as they are not allowing me to pay off the older balance which is being charged interest. 
XX/XX/XXXX - paid {$200.00} XX/XX/XXXX - paid {$100.00} XX/XX/XXXX - paid {$90.00} XX/XX/XXXX - paid {$85.00} XX/XX/XXXX - paid {$80.00} XX/XX/XXXX - paid {$600.00} XX/XX/XXXX - paid {$200.00} Total {$1300.00} - which should have paid my purchase balance in full, and any overage towards the newer 0 % promo balance. 

Step 4 : What company is this complaint about? - Wells Fargo Credit card Step 5 : Who are the people involved? XXXX in customer service and a rep from their credit card escalations dept. ( don't remember his name ) I spoke to them both on XX/XX/XXXX, and both told me my payments can not be reallocated to pay off the older balance, and that i could pay {$440.00} today and that would satisfy my purchase balance accumulating interest and then my future payments would be applied all towards my promotional balance. I believe they are doing this, so they can continue to charge me interest on a balance that would have already been paid in full. 
Additionally, they charged me a late fee for my XX/XX/XXXX due date, when the payment was made a month early on XX/XX/XXXX. They waived the late fee, however i feel like they will charge me a late fee on any future payments made before my due date, which i am sure i would have to call in and have them remove ; like i had to do today."
3557,"I have purchased something and cancelled the order without items getting delivered at all from XXXX using XXXX and charged to my Wells Fargo Credit Card. I was short-refunded of {$100.00} short ( e.g {$1000.00} paid, {$900.00} refund ). 

I have opened disputes twice with XXXX, XXXX refused to cooperate, asking for random proof like tracking numbers, recording of call, that I can't possibly prove. 

Then finally I have opened a dispute with Wells Fargo to chargeback XXXX then Wells Fargo declined dispute without any explanation even providing my receipts and proofs plenty of times. 

Important fact is that I am deaf person. That makes a phone call incredibly difficult."
3558,"Opened a secured credit card almost 3 years ago and was told it will "" graduate '' to an unsecured card within a year resulting in a higher credit limit and refund of my deposit. Has not happened and when I call to ask for information, they only say "" we aren't sure why. '' Since then, my credit has improved significantly and I have no trouble getting pre-approvals or limit increases yet this card is sitting there in limbo"
3559,"I was at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and they offered promotional financing. I know they said promotional financing, because I didn't want another line of credit on my account. I get home and turns out I get a new credit card."
3560,"I applied for a Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX card with a credit score of XXXX that I built over the past 3 years. I have a job lined up that I will be starting in XXXX and I have proof of this through an offer and acceptance letter. After I applied, I was notified that I have to provide my last three paystubs before I can get approved for this card. I called them and told them about my situation in terms of my job and that I will be unable to provide paystubs for my job until XXXX. They told me that they are unable to give me a card and that they won't take my offer/acceptance letter. I believe that I was denied this credit card unfairly as I have a good credit score and proof of a job with the salary I specified in the application."
3561,"Wells Fargo is gouging people on interest, continuing their unethical business practices. I have been a cardholder for approximately 1 year. I have a credit score of approximately 710+. I have no late payments or over limits with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo has insisted on charging me their highest interest rate, nearly 27 % on my credit card once my promotional period ends. It is completely unacceptable to have a rate this high, especially with my credit profile. I have asked repeatedly for the rate to be reviewed and lowered to the range of my other credit cards which are 13 % to 20 %. They have refused - in what seems to be violation of US federal law which requires rates to be periodically reviewed. Their customer service pretends to care but really just gives you the run around so they can continue to gouge you. It is appalling."
3564,"XX/XX/2022 someone opened a credit card with wells fargo bank using my information ( assuming my XXXX XXXX ) Wells Fargo cancel card and listed as fraud I locked and froze my credit. 

I do not know the address fraudulent card was mail to Wells Fargo would not tell me mailing address or email address that was used"
3568,"I called Wells Fargo at XXXX on XX/XX/2018 to initiate a charge back of {$2700.00} on a contractor whom installed a mini split system without a permit, a suspended license, and multiple code violations. The case was handle by XXXX. We fax all supporting document to XXXX on XX/XX/2018 with the claim number XXXX. The case was close XX/XX/2018 when they get a respond from the merchant. The merchant said the unit was installed and working which did not address the original complaint. 

I opened a new case on XX/XX/2018 with XXXX XXXX, the case was closed on XX/XX/2018 when merchant responded that I sign a waiver to not require a permit. I asked the representative to provide proof of said waiver, representative said they don't have it on file and to contact the merchant for a copy. I asked XXXX XXXX whether he confirms the contractor pull the requires permit and have proper licencing. XXXX XXXX avoid answering the question. 

I opened a new case on XX/XX/2018 with XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) at XXXX. XXXX can not find any of the supporting documents, ask me to fax over new ones to XXXX. XXXX confirms they received the fax and the case will be handle by XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) at XXXX. 

XX/XX/2018 Called XXXX left Voice Mail ( VM ). XXXX called back said case was not assigned to her, confirmed fax was received and will call back on XX/XX/2018. 

XX/XX/2018 Did not received called from XXXX, called and left VM. XXXX called back she said she was waiting on billing. XXXX   said she will get answer by end of day, told to call back tomorrow.

Called XXXX left VM XX/XX/2018 Called XXXX, left VM. Received call back from XXXX she said the case was closed. The merchant responded was no permit was need for the job. I told her the city needs permit for any work that cost more than {$500.00}. I asked her why the case was closed without fact checking on consulting the customer. She would not give a valid answer I sent in proof of the merchant 's violations, the code they broke and a copy of California 's mechanic code highlighting the exact statue. 

I sent in a copy of the permits pulled for the property XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX which shows the lack of permit by the merchant. 

I sent a copy of a web page by the California Contractor 's License Board which shows the merchant 's license is suspended. 

There is a clear pattern of rulings in favor of the merchant without necessary proof. Often the rulings are decided with information that contradicts previous statements made by me ; information that can be verify with minimum efforts. 

There is a clear pattern of inane bureaucracy designed to wear the consumer down. Complaints are reported to take 10 business day to resolve. I requested multiple call back and progress updates, the promises were broken every time.

Each complaint was resolve without back communication to the me, there is no chance for customer rebuttal, the process is : I open case, I send or resend all due diligence, the merchant waits till the last minute to respond, WF accepts merchant response at face value, WF closes the case. I then ask for the proof that led to WF 's decision. I have no received any.

WF has a double standard for burden of proof concerning consumer and merchant."
3570,"My XXXX year old son took my credit card and made a purchase on XXXX of XXXX. I was not aware of this purchase, nor did I authorize his use of my card. When I called Wells Fargo to dispute the transaction, they said that they do not dispute charges from family members. This is completely opposite the current legislation and I see no verbiage that includes an exception for family members. My son is XXXX, ( actually he passed away now unfortunately so he is dead ), or was XXXX at the time, a full adult of his own and he should be held responsible for fraud as if anyone else took my card and used it."

3572,On XX/XX/XXXX I went to my local bank to get a cashier check I gave my card and ID to the banker over there who stated that my card shows that it was reported lost and no longer active to use and that I will receive a new card in the mail. I destroyed my card and throw it away. A few days after I start getting charges on my card that the banker told me it was no longer active. Total charges were around {$2900.00}. The bank havent fix the problem yet. But I have a feeling that they are doing something wrong to other people too
3574,"I was contacted by Wells Fargo 's automated service on XX/XX/2020 of insufficient funds in my account. The auto-payment of the credit card, which had been suspended, was reactivated without warning and drafted from the wrong account. 

As a result, I have incurred a {$35.00} returned payment fee. It also seems my credit was affected. I made Wells Fargo aware on XX/XX/2020 by phone call that the amount needed to be reversed and all automatic payments needed to be suspended. I noted on this phone call that I would like written resolution, as well as an email confirming that I had contacted them on the matter. 

I received a confirmation of my complaint on XX/XX/2020 stating that the matter would be resolved, at the latest, within 10 business days. It has now been 11 business days and my account has not been credited with the fees that were erroneously charged to me after an automated charge that was cancelled was run against the incorrect account."
3575,"I filed a dispute with Wells Fargo concerning a XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) transaction in early XXXX. Wells Fargo initially accepted my dispute, but then they closed the dispute in XXXX, stating that XXXX and XXXX denied the claim. However, when I contacted XXXX, the dispute was still open. So I sent a fax to Wells Fargo ( since there was no other way to contact them ) with the email thread from XXXX, where I asked Wells Fargo to reopen the dispute and hold the amount that is due until the issue is resolved with XXXX. Wells Fargo acknowledged received of my fax, but no further reply was received. The credit card payment in the amount of the dispute is due XX/XX/2022. 

Credit card account number : XXXX Amount ( transaction ) : {$1200.00} Dispute initially submitted to Wells Fargo : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX"
3577,"Regarding recently closed complaint XXXX : 1. ) Despite asking to close this account since XX/XX/2018 in the presence of a Wells Fargo Representative at the Wells Fargo location inside of the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX Utah, while on the phone with a representative from the Wells Fargo Card Service, Wells Fargo continues to send me notices that I am delinquent on this credit card that was closed months ago. 

2. ) Wells Fargo purposefully took longer than necessary to apply my collateral of {$300.00} to the account to incur more fees and to attempt to put a negative mark on my credit as a penalty for closing my credit card. The collateral was not applied until yesterday, XX/XX/2018, despite requesting this account to be closed on XX/XX/2018. 

3. ) The notice that I was sent this week directly conflicts with what my account says when I log in ( see both attached ). My account currently states that i owe {$16.00} ( which is not true as well ). The letter states that I am in default {$58.00}. Wells Fargo is purposefully being confusing as yet another penalty for closing my credit card. 

4. ) This entire situation was unnecessary and arose from Wells Fargo charging myself a late fee on or before the actual due date of payment on this account. 

5. ) This ongoing issue that I have with Wells Fargo charging my credit card fees that no one would explain and then denying closure of my account repeatedly for several weeks since XX/XX/2018 has caused myself much unnecessary waste of personal time and added stress. Total time lost due to this unnecessary situation is approximately 4 hours to date. 

6. ) It is my belief that Wells Fargo routinely targets low income and credit score disadvantaged individuals with these types of "" miscommunications '' and illegal fees as a means to strong-arm credit disadvantaged individuals who are in fear of receiving a bad credit report from Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo also uses this as a means to dissuade these same disadvantaged individuals from closing their accounts. This activity described is both illegal and immoral."
3578,"I opened an account at XXXX XXXX to receive a small discount when purchasing a new laptop. This store is in XXXX, Ohio close to my home there. The total amount of the purchase was {$600.00}. The store application for the credit card of the store would not accept my telephone number that I use in XXXX, I listed my XXXX telephone number which does not work in XXXX. I live part time in XXXX and only return to the states every 6 months. 
I received the laptop and returned with it back to XXXX XXXX, XXXX on XX/XX/2021. In XXXX my daughter sent me a copy of the statement from XXXX. I tried to set-up an account but you must use the XXXX telephone number ( which I can't here in XXXX XXXX I have called and requested that they send me a invoice via my XXXX but they refuse to do that? They also refuse to call my phone here in XXXX? So I called Wells Fargo and paid the full amount of {$600.00} with my checking bank account at chase.

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email saying to contact them about my account? You can't reply to that email? They request that I call? I tried to call ( which is another international call charge ) and they put me on hold for over 30 mins? Very frustrating! 

On XX/XX/XXXX, today I again called and asked why my payment did not go through and was told that the agent used a account number that was not correct? I asked for a way for me to pay this now and was told that I must again give them my checking account number or a debit card?

They will not give me another way to pay my account online They will not send me direct emails and force me to spend international telephone calls to them? 
They keep adding late charges and interest on my closed account?

3580,"On a previous response to the CFPB there was a different answer than the letter I received denying me a credit card through Wells Fargo. 
Previous complaint : XXXX. 
I provided my information/ social security number at the time of application. 
The letter said I had delinquencies on my credit, I do not. 
This response is a lie, I did provide my information and no one from WF reached out to ask me for that information. 
This is bait and switch and highly illegal to get my information. 
Additionally, I have received many spam calls and emails since this application. 
This is upsetting, I expect them to make it right, if you pulled my credit and sent me a denial letter you had my social security number! 
You would not say in the letter that I have delinquencies if you didn't pull my credit. 
Shameful behavior!"
3583,I was on the Wells Fargo website and it basically has a banner for government officials going through hardships. I called on XX/XX/2018 and spoke with a nice gentleman explaining if next month as a government official how are you Wells Fargo helping those victims? And his response was we will waive late fees but not defer payment so credit is not effected. After all Wells Fargo knowing that it was defrauding customers to the point of then CEO stepping down and I believe having to give the money back. In my opinion if Wells Fargo is trying to help the American people then why are they not giving extensions so credit ratings are not impacted by the call on Mr President to close aspects of government.
3585,"Last year a charge was placed on my credit card without my knowing. Auto-payment had not been set up on this particular credit card because I was not regularly using it. I was only made aware of the charge several months after the fact, and immediately closed the account. However, Wells Fargo has marked the account as having a late payment, and is not willing to amend their records. I have tried reaching out to them several times and they have responded stating that they must report all late payments as part of federal compliance. I would like to explore other options, as I have never had issues with late payments on any other account, and it has impacted my credit score negatively."
3586,"On XX/XX/18 I went to "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' to purchase groceries. I had over {$1000.00} in my checking account but I was denied purchase stating that my card was rejected. I inputted my password at least four times but to no avail. It was the third time I had been rejected in the last three months : XXXX, XXXX & XX/XX/2018. I believe they are holding my money to meet their threshold or quota for the month or quarter. I called them each time and I couldn't get a straight answer, their responses rooted in perpetual lies. I look forward to having this issue resolved and not be humiliated holding up long lines of angry shoppers waiting."
3589,I ordered a new XXXX credit card as mine did not work somebody received it in the mail was able to create a pin and activate the card and 5 days in a row each day they took out {$500.00} out of an ATM at Wells Fargo five different ATMs at five different Wells Fargo 's never called me never told me and then on XX/XX/XXXX I check my statement and all five transactions went through on that one day so I didn't even have time to find out this was going on they never called me to let me know or red flag it. Over XXXX was taken out I once tried to buy a concert ticket and they denied me {$300.00} to buy the concert ticket so I don't understand why it was not red flagged {$2500.00} cash advances I've had this credit cards since XXXX I only use it for automatic payments I never use it as a hard copy All these transactions were hard copy payments If you look back at my history I don't use the card just for automatic bill paying then I make my payment. This should have been red flagged as the history of me using the card is inaccurate of what happened.
3590,"I was approached by Wells Fargo during a university 's new student orientation day in XX/XX/XXXX. I opened a checking and a credit card accounts in XX/XX/XXXX. A college credit card had a limit of {$1000.00}. After two years, I called Wells Fargo to see if that credit limit can be increased. I was still a college student at this point. The customer representative said yes. After few minutes he said now you have a credit card with {$5000.00} limit. And I said, there must have been a confusion I just want to increase the limit of the current card I hold. The customer service representative said he could not increase the college credit card because it was a college credit card and had a limit of {$1000.00}. So in XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo opened a flexible spending credit card under my name without my permission. Now from what I hear Wells Fargo has been doing, I also am a victim of their fraud. Since Wells Fargo is my first bank, it's hard to close my bank account with them without having my credit downgraded. There should be a policy where credit card opened without your consent, your credit score should not be hurt. I urge Wells Fargo 's practice to college students to be closely reexamined."
3592,"Wells Fargo, appeared o my credit reports, with a balance of over {$11000.00}, I contacted them by mail, since XX/XX/2015 to XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have further written to them, and has provided with police report, and letter, stating that this account was opened fraudulently. 

I was told, that I needed to make payments, in order for this issue, not to be reported on my credit reports. 

Therefore, I have paid about {$4000.00}, or so on this fraudulently account to prevent them from damaging my credit worthiness. I have filed with this Agency before about this issue. Yet, WELLS FARGO refuses to clear this for me, knowing, that I did not apply for any credit cards with WF. 

I have spoken to date with every ne in the customer services dept., supervisors, managers in the fraud department, and with the headquarters/executive officers, Yet, they continue to request payment s on this account, which is definitely were not opened by me. 

How wf opened this account, when I am I A M A VITIM OF IDENTTY THEFT, AS WELLAS A FRAUD VICTIM, IS BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION. ALL THREE MANOR CREDIT BUREAUS HAVE A FRAUD ALERT ONMY PROFILES. 

I Refuse to take any other payments on this account, when they still ruined my credit worthiness, and I WILL NOT BE LABLE FOR THIS FRAUDLENT ACCOUNT. FURTHER REQUEST THROUGH WELLS FARGO, TO EFUND ME BACK EVERY PENNY, INWHICH I HAVE PAID THEM, YETTHEY DECIDED NOT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY REUESRTS AT ALL, AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED, I CAN SUE OR OPENING A FRAUDLENTLY ACCDER MY INFORMATION. I INTENT TO DO SO, IF THEY CONTIUE TO NOT COMPLY WITH MY REQUESTS. 

WELLS FARGO IS A FRAUD CREDIT COMPANY, INWHICH, TEHY FRAUDLENTLY OPEN ACCOUBTS UNDER FRAUD VICTIMS PERSONAL INFORMATION, ANDREFUSE TO MAKE ANY CORRECTIONS TO SOLVE THE ISSUES AT HAND AT ALL. a letter from wells Fargo, states an account ending in # XXXX, balance : {$11000.00}, IN WHICH IS ALL FRAUDLENTLY CHARGES ONTHE THE FRAUDENT OPENING OF THIS ACCOUNT, IN WHICH I have never received, JUST BILING S INTHE MAIL. 

THEY Also HAVE MY NAME WRONG : "" XXXX XXXX WITH PARTIALLY INCORRECT ADDRES : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ', THIS TOO IS INCORRECT."
3598,"I have a loan with WELLS FARGO DEALER SVC. I have always made my payments on time. For some reason I realized that there was a late payment on my credit report. As you can see, I have always had a stellar payment record with this company. I tried contacting both XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and WELLS FARGO DEALER SVC with no successful resolution. XXXX, XXXX and XXXX  are reporting me late. There was definitely an error on their part. I was never 30 days late XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX."
3600,"In XXXX XXXX my credit card was used without my permission, I notified the bank in a time manner but the Bank failed to investigate appropriately my case and at the end they denied my case without providing a good reason for the denial. 
Bank ended reporting this balance to credit bureaus and late payments as well and I was not informed that I have to keep making payments for a balance resulted in purchases that I never approved. 
Transactions information : {$360.00} XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) {$42.00} XXXX XXXX Georgia Wells Fargo applied fees and interests to those transactions in the mean time that I was waiting for them to complete the investigation. 

I been trying to resolve this situation from almost a year ago and I dont have any positive outcome, I had to pay the money with all the fees and interest applied by Wells Fargo."
3601,"On XX/XX/2022, I applied for the XXXX XXXX from Wells Fargo. Through the application I applied for a balance transfer from Wells Fargo to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). I was approved for {$2300.00} to be transfer to the XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/2022, the balance transfer appeared in my Wells Fargo account but not on my XXXX XXXX. 

I waited 7 days because I know a transaction like can take a few days. When nothing happened I reached out to XXXX and they notified me that they do not accept balance transfers electronically and that the money would be returned when received but that at the moment nothing had been received. I reached out to Wells Fargo and I was told to wait because sometimes transaction can take up to 30 days. 

I kept waiting and called back but this time I did a three way call with XXXX and Wells Fargo. XXXX informed Wells Fargo that funds were not received so a refund could not be made. After XXXX left the call Wells Fargo offered me to escalate the issue with an investigation that could take up to 90 days. This was in XX/XX/2022. 

I kept calling throughout the 90 days and was told to wait and I did. At the beginning of XXXX, I decided to go personally to a Wells Fargo branch here in XXXX. I went with all my XXXX XXXX statements since XX/XX/2022 to show them that nothing was received. The banker told me that she would do everything in her power to help and apologized in behalf of the bank. After she made calls I was told the same that the 90 day investigation was still under place and that I needed to wait 2 more weeks so I waited. 

I then received an email saying that the balance transfer was successful so no refund was going to be provided. I went back to the bank and met with the banker again and she told me the same but that she would try and find out more. She sent me a document via email of the balance transfer information and when reviewing the document I noticed that the credit card number was incorrect and that the bank where the money went was to a XXXX and not a XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I decided to call XXXX again and the representative told me that they could start a payment dispute but that the credit card number entered did not belong to a XXXX XXXX XXXX account. I informed all of this to the banker from Wells Fargo and I was told that because I entered the information wrong and that the money had already been paid by the bank they could not do anything else for me. 

Nonetheless this experience has been the most frustrating ever. My bank to which I have entrusted my money for the past 2 years has not had my back or not even the will to help me contact XXXX which I can not contact because I do not have an account with them and I have been left to do an investigation myself when I do not have the resources a bank like Wells Fargo do. 
I contacted Wells Fargo again today to give them one last chance and I was pretty much told that once the funds has already left the bank it was not their responsibility to contact XXXX or any other bank."
3605,"- On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a new credit card with Wells Fargo and found out that my XXXX credit card was closed without my notice : no phone call, no mail, no email. I believe it was around XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX since that the last email monthly email I received from them. The account had XXXX reward points in it ( email attached ). 

- On XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, XXXX, I contacted Wells Fargo customer service a few times and got the same answer that they could not find any information about the closed account. I went to a local Wells Fargo and had them filed an escalation. 

- On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from Wells Fargo saying that the account was closed because of a long inactive period. And that they could not do anything to get my reward point back."
3608,"In XX/XX/XXXX, my mother and I visited a XXXX discount furniture for a living room set. We ended up purchasing a set and placing the cost on a installment plan with Wells Fargo. The first bill arrived at my mother house approximately 2 weeks prior to the first due date on XX/XX/XXXX. I, her son, am in charge of her affairs as she is an elderly woman and does not have online access or can keep up with payments. I tried to establish an account online to make the payment on XX/XX/XXXX. The security measures Wells Fargo takes to identify my mother made it impossible to establish an account. One manner was calling her with a numerical code so that I can establish the account online. My mother, being elderly could not understand the Wells Fargo call and we were not able to establish an account online. I called the Bank several times that day to authenticate my mother over the phone and receive a temporary password to establish the account. The representative 's response was that they were unable to establish the account and that my mother an I had to visit a local branch to remedy the issue. My mother and I both live in separate states and finding a local branch ended up being very burdensome. The following weekend on XX/XX/XXXX, we coordinated a visit to the bank, having my elderly travel to NJ in the process. The branch was able to talk to a representative that provided us a temporary password and I established an online account and paid the amount later that day. After all of the running around, Wells Fargo charged us a {$27.00} late fee they did not want to waive. I called several times on XX/XX/XXXX and they made the process of even speaking for my mother difficult, even after she stated over the phone that she allows my privilege to speak in her regard. The late fee is a result of burdensome practices that made it impossible to establish an account online. Given their background, this may be another possible way for them to increase income. I file this complaint to aid others with the same issue and give rise to potentially another scheme Wells Fargo is plotting to raise income."
3610,"XX/XX/XXXX As an existing credit card customer I contacted Wells Fargo to make a product change from my existing XXXX card to their cashback card offering the following promotion : "" Earn a {$200.00} cash rewards bonus when you spend {$1000.00} in purchases in the first 3 months. I exceeded the {$1000.00} in purchases within the first month. Contacted XXXX and was told I didn't qualify as this was not a "" new '' card and that "" changing products '' did not qualify. 

At no time during the conversation to change to the different card, nor in their online agreement does it state that I was not eligible for the {$200.00} cash rewards bonus and yet with the exception of one representative, they say I'm not eligible. The one representative, XXXX XXXX, later agreed with my claim, she however did not have the authority to credit my account and so I was transferred to her supervisor who I left a voicemail for. This supervisor did not return my call. After many more calls, requests for escalation in an attempt to have a conversation with a supervisor, not one supervisor returned my calls. To date, Wells Fargo has yet to provide proof that I don't qualify for the promotion. 

Following are the dates I contacted XXXX along with the representative or supervisor and the case numbers.

3612,"Refused to close my account. Charged interest rate. Put me in collection.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I went online to make a normal monthly payment. Due on XX/XX/XXXX. I selected the incorrect amount, apparently selecting a button that said pay the full amount. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I noted that my checking account was debited for a "" NSF Fee ''. 

I called Wells Fargo immediately - and was informed that the payment would pass through the bank up to 4 times. I asked if there was a way to stop it, explaining I made an error. They said only after it attempted 4 times, and returned 4 times would that be possible. As once it is "" in the system '' there is no way to turn it off. 

So, I called my bank and arranged for a personal line of credit, sufficient to pay the XXXX. 

I was charged XXXX by Wells Fargo for an NSF Fee. I promptly paid this on XX/XX/XXXX. 

That payment was extracted the NSF on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called Wells Fargo and asked them to please reprocess the payment for the full amount. I informed them I had taken a personal loan and would like them to extract the full amount ( XXXX ). They informed me that they were not able to accomplish - except sometime in the "" next 15 days ''. 

Would you not know, 16 days from when they made this claim ( XX/XX/XXXX ) is when the account was due for its normal payment. And that it could then be reported as delinquent. 

I have never missed a payment with this bank. My mortgage is with this bank and I have had the home projects. I made an error that should not even be able to be made with no checks and balances system. And to be certain, a phone call should have been able to be made and have the situation rectified right then."

This is 7-8 days before due. The USPS took until XXXX to deliver the payment. On XXXX Wells Fargo went ahead and charged a {$27.00} late fee and {$14.00} in interest. They cashed my check on XXXX according to my bank website. I called and spoke with XXXX on XXXX at XXXX EST. The company refuses to acknowledge the Postal Service delay Problems and the fact that the check was dated and mailed before the due date. They will not waive the late fees. I have never been late in paying Wells Fargo in years of having this card. I do business with other companies that do not charge late fees if the payment was post marked before the due date even if it arrives late. It appears that Wells Fargo is using a national crises to gouge customers for fees that are beyond their control.

I asked if she could conference call the number for XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX and she somehow could n't reach the extension number I gave her. XXXX at Wells Fargo tried to connect me to the executive office for business accounts but she was not able to. She said she will leave my contact information with that department and someone should be getting a hold of me.

3628,"Background information : I am a resident of the state of California. California Code, Civil Code CIV 1747.85 states "" Unless requested by the cardholder, no card issuer shall cancel a credit card without having first given the cardholder 30 days ' written notice of its intention to do so unless the cardholder is or has been within the last 90 days in default of payment or otherwise in violation of any provision of the agreement between the card issuer and the cardholder governing the cardholder 's use of the credit card or unless the card issuer has evidence or reasonable belief that the cardholder is unable or unwilling to repay obligations incurred under the agreement or that an unauthorized use of the card may be made. 
Nothing provided herein shall be construed to prohibit a card issuer from placing the account of a cardholder on inactive status if the cardholder has not used the card for a period in excess of 18 months or from requiring that cardholder, upon subsequent reuse of a card, to provide to the card issuer such updated information as will enable the card issuer to verify the current creditworthiness of the cardholder. '' XX/XX/XXXX : At this time, I had a consumer credit card account open with Wells Fargo in good standing.

XX/XX/XXXX : Said letter was received by me via USPS. Upon checking the account through the website, I verified that the account was closed and that the associated rewards account had XXXX "" XXXX XXXX Rewards '' points deducted from the account balance leaving a balance of XXXX. The balance of XXXX   points in the account was unable to be redeemed since the minimum redemption amount is XXXX points, and it is impossible to earn additional points since the associated credit card account was closed. 
XX/XX/XXXX : I inquired on the matter with a Wells Fargo banker at a bank branch. No additional information on the closure was provided to me. I opened a dispute with Wells Fargo to request reopening of the account and a reinstatement of the rewards account point balance."

My XXXX XXXX XXXX is under the direction of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, fl. XXXX the reason why my corporation was in that direction was because this person advised me and guided me in my business my relationship with that person was only Friendship was not even mine, the credit card came home because my company was registered in that address. 
This Mr. never notified me that the card had arrived, he activated my card knowing that the personal banker of the exchange changed my primary number to that of him, and XXXX XXXX had access to activate this card, using this card and taking it to limit in a 30-day period of {$10000.00} I realize when I receive an over limit alert I notify my bank of the fraud occurred, they inform me that to do an investigation they need a police report. 
Within a few days I got a police report cooperating with the bank with everything they needed. The next step was to close the XXXX XXXX co-op and close the bank account. Wells fargo denying my claim for having the same address and telephone number, and explaining that I never supply the telephone number of this XXXX XXXX from where this card was activated, explaining that the fraud had started from the representative of the bank that made me the application for the card. I sign that application but I give you my data, and my only cellular number that I have is XXXX. This XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX was not legally authorized to use my card. the only one authorized to use the card was me.

I spent about 6 months trying to solve this with the bank explaining how everything happened, giving him physical evidence where he proves my innocence and proves that it is a fraud and sincerely to them they do not care, everything that I know ... has been for me because they have not done any research on it. The last claim I made about two months and still I have not a single answer : I asked the following : 1. Where was the money taken from my own merchant, which bank account was, because my account of that merchant was with Wells fargo himself and was not for that account 2. The signatures of all transactions made in XXXX Florida 3. The use of this card made in XXXX The only solution to this fraud is for the bank to do its work, to take responsibility for its mistakes, because this fraud started from the same bank, where the same bank can give proof that this banker XXXX XXXX was the person who attended all the accounts of this XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX since XXXX. And the bank trying to blame me where there is no legal role where this XXXX XXXX is authorized to use my business card.

Unfortunately, on the 27th day of use ( XX/XX/20 ) the screen cracked. I went to go two physical XXXX stores to see if I can have it replaced since they informed me that I had 30 days to replace the phone if there was anything wrong with it but they would not accept it. Then, I called XXXX to see if the phone comes with a manufacturer warranty but they voided my warranty by claiming that my cracked screen was an "" accidental cause. '' So instead they referred me to one of their partners to fix the phone at a "" discounted price. '' The discount isn't much of a difference. It is only about a $ 4- {$5.00} dollar difference. Then I checked the terms and conditionals online for a Visa Platinum debit card since that is supposedly what my card is and what is advertised on the Wells Fargo website including on the front of my card. According to Visa, a platinum debit card has purchase protection and my phone would apply. So I contacted Visa and they checked card number. VIsa informed me that my card does not come with purchase protection. They even checked years prior to see if it is something that Wellsfargo cards used to have but had it previously removed without informing their customers. It never had purchase protection, although the card and website advertises as a platinum debit. Then, I had Visa check another Visa that I have with a different bank and that one does have purchase protection. Then I called Wells Fargo to explain my issue with their false advertisement. They didn't really know what to do so they put in a ticket to investigate and contact XXXX to see if they can give me my money back. However, I only have until XX/XX/20 to fix this issue so that I can replace my phone. I don't trust this product anymore since it cracked so easily with just one drop."
3634,"To Whom It May concern : I am writing in regards to a Wells Fargo account # XXXX. There are several things reporting inaccurately, untimely, or unverifiable on this account. The Federal Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) permits the removal of such accounts from the credit file. The reasons I dispute this account are as follows : 1 ) Balance  incorrect. Should be {$400.00}. 
2 ) Delinquency date is incorrect. The correct date was the one listed prior to the XX/XX/XXXX date. 
3 ) Statement number 2 then makes this account too old to be reporting and should be immediately deleted. 
4 ) Well Fargo states I made a payment in XXXX and the date of delinquency is XX/XX/XXXX. 
Both statements are incorrect. 
5 ) When requested, Wells Fargo does not, nor has is to this day, furnished validation or proof to the information reported on my report, I.e. the items listed in 4 above. Account should have been removed here as FCRA calls for the removal of unverifiable information. Wells Fargo failed to respond. FCRA states that this debt is no longer valid. 
6. When requested, Wells Fargo failed to provide the original contract with Wells Fargo containing my wet ink signature. 

As you can see, there are several violations of the FCRA and FDCPA. Please cease reporting this account for any of the above listed reasons. There are multiple violations here and if you continue reporting this false information you may face further consequences as allowed by law which I will proceed with should Wells Fargo fail to remove this account from all of my reports and cancel the debt as verification/validation was not furnished upon request.

The invoice I received from the company does not state that I agreed to a credit card or what the payments are, however the invoice does state that there's a 9.99 % APR ( which is what I agreed to ) On XXXX XXXX, I received a credit card agreement from Wells Fargo. The agreement states that my APR is 28.99 % -which is not what I agreed to-and doesn't list out the 'special terms and apr ' period is."
3645,this account was open due to identity theft and was not verified by me.
3646,"Wells Fargo is negatively impacting my credit card credit limit because of forbearance on my mortgage. We need CFPB to help protect consumers like me against this. 

Today XXXX/XXXX/20 I was unable to charge my payments at my grocery store on my Wells Fargo Credit Card. I called Wells Fargo and was surprised my credit line was decreased from {$13000.00} to {$4100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I had been making on time minimum monthly payments to my 0 % credit card. I had also checked my credit score a few days ago and my credit score improved since when I had received my credit card from Wells Fargo. I had explained this to customer service as well as their credit line risk department, and wanted to understand why my credit line decreased. I was told Wells Fargo uses an internal risk management process which does not rely on credit score. This risk management process was arbitrary, and I asked to speak a risk management manager. When I got the call back later on XXXX/XXXX/20, I was told risk management takes into account that I submitted my forbearance on my mortgage at Wells Fargo in XXXX. And even if the decrease in my credit was wrong Wells Fargo can not restore my credit line because of the forbearance on my mortgage. My understanding is that this goes against the spirit and the letter of what congress intended for the forbearance as well as using credit score to shield consumers from negative impact on their credit standing. Wells Fargo needs to reverse this policy."
3647,"I was really young, I believe just turned XXXX. My Dad took me to get a credit card with a {$500.00} limit, he ended up using it and defaulting on it without me knowing. I was in another state when my parents split. I am now XXXX and ready to start properly using credit cards, I even took a course on using them properly. I was told to come to this website to get that account wiped off my credit report. I really want to start with a clean slate so that I can truly build my future and relationships with the banks. I have since then built a multiple six figure business that is pushing out XXXX in expenses a month. I can be earning points with this but I am not because of my Dad 's ill minded mistake 5 years ago. Just now found out. 

XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( 4 yrs, 7 mos ) Was when the card was opened and {$800.00} was used until XX/XX/XXXX and this was with Wells Fargo. 

Please help me remove this so I can start fresh. Thanks!"
3649,"Statement closing date and due date rolling 3 to 5 days in either direction every few months, but generally a due date on the XXXX, except this month, it was the XXXX. Invoked a {$39.00} junk fee. Nefarious business practice is designed to trip up payment sequence. Evidence : I have 2 accounts, one on auto pay, date never changes, second account, no auto pay, they slide the due date around. You ought to look into this."
3650,I Submitted an application through Wells Fargo and they are denying my application because I have a fraud alert this is against the law and they are violating my rights. They advised that they can not verify my phone number because of a third party company that they refuse to name. It is my right as a consumer to dispute any information that is not accurate to include a third party company not being able to verify my phone number that is listed in on my XXXX  credit profile and is also the same number they have verified multiple times in which I call them through.This is not fair and Wells Fargo is discriminating against me because I have a fraud alert.
3652,"Wells Fargo uploaded a completed research letter to CFPB, letter dated; XX/XX/XXXX, showing the 3 fraudulent accounts I have reported to them since XX/XX/XXXX and who are also reporting on my credit reports ; XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, etc. I have reported the fraud to Wells Fargo by sending a letter to them, dated XX/XX/XXXX, which was sent by XXXX Certified Mail with Return Receipt Requested. They did receive this letter but never responded to it. These account were not opened by me nor authorized and demand they are removed from my credit reports immediately. FTC Identity Theft Report is attached."
3655,"I have sought to have my physical mailing address removed from Wells Fargo Credit Card services. I am not a customer, nor do I every intend to be, and after receiving new credit card solicitations addressed to former owners of my current home, I went online to see if Wells Fargo has an opt-out option to stop the unsolicited mailings. While their Privacy Center web page allows current customers with an online username and password to make certain requests related to their data, they do not provide any other options to contact the Privacy Center other than their general XXXX number. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called the general customer service line ( XXXX ) to seek removal of my address from their promotional materials. My first call led me to a customer service representative from what I believe was outside the country who was reading from a script and had a very thick accent. She offered to transfer me to another department, but upon placing me on hold the line was disconnected. 

I called back immediately and was placed in contact with a customer service representative stateside. She tried connecting me to the Privacy Department, but I was on hold for at least 20 minutes before she could get anyone on the line. She checked on me a couple times asking if I would like to continue holding until she could make contact with someone. When she was finally able to make the connection, I was transferred to the Privacy Department. There I explained the nature of my request and was placed on hold again. This time I was transferred to yet another person and was given the number to call back in case I was disconnected ( XXXX ). 

This time I spoke with a second privacy center representative who tried to assist, but ultimately told me the only way to respond to the situation was to write undeliverable and send it back to the United States Post Office. After telling her I have returned similar mailings using the presorted standard mail category ( i.e. junk mail ), but my local post office always returns it to me and tells me to recycle them. I asked her if it was Wells Fargos policy to respond to requests to remove addresses off their solicitation mailings by placing it back on the federal agency, she responded that is all the information she had for me. This call lasted 36 minutes. 

I checked Wells Fargo online policy regarding the Privacy Center ( dated XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ) which directs those who want to limit the sharing and direct marketing by mail, specifically for those without a Wells Fargo account , to call the XXXX number. So I called that number only to be placed back into the automated call queue that I initially encountered-basically directed back to their general XXXX line, thus back to square one. 

My concern is the hoops you have to jump just to get off Wells Fargos unsolicited mailing list. Given Wells Fargos numerous class action lawsuits, including the XXXX XXXX unauthorized credit card and bank accounts opened without consent, I had legitimate concerns about my address being tied to this company. It is only a matter of time before they start tying my name as the home owner of the address."
3656,"I was a victim of identity theft on XX/XX/2020, and subsequently filed an Identity Theft Report ( # XXXX ). Two fraudulent applications were submitted in my name online ; 1. XXXX, and 2. Wells Fargo. I have been able to successfully resolve the issue with XXXX, received a letter from XXXXXXXX that their investigation verified that the account was opened fraudulently, and received a copy of the fraudulent application in a timely manner, as requested. However, Wells Fargo has failed to comply with my request for a copy of the application, and continues to state their investigation indicated the application made online was valid. This is absolutely false! 

The bottom line is that I want the HARD INQUIRY WITHDRAWN which was made by Wells Fargo and a copy of the fraudulent application that I have requested repeatedly in writing and via telephone conversations with representatives of Wells Fargo. 

To begin, I received a letter from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/2020, indicating that I had been denied a credit card that I NEVER APPLIED FOR online!. As result of this fraudulent application, Wells Fargo placed a hard inquiry into my credit which is now on my credit report and has negatively affected my credit score. Although this may seem minor, I have been diligently trying to repair my credit score, and this is an unfair practice on Wells Fargo 's part as they have repeatedly informed me in writing that their investigation into the application indicated that the application was valid ( letters received dated XX/XX/2020 and XXXX, 2020 ). This is not possible since I did not apply, and I have been given inconsistent information from Wells Fargo personnel regarding the "" investigation ''. 

After receiving the letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Well Fargo and spoke to a representative, XXXX, and informed him that I had not applied for a credit card with Wells Fargo. He asked me some questions related to the information on the application and informed me that the security questions did not match the information on the application, but that I would need to contact the Fraud Department which I did writing on XX/XX/2020. I also requested a copy of the application that was submitted online pursuant to Section 609 ( e ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This resulted in a letter from Wells Fargo stating the application was valid ( XX/XX/2020 ). 

After receiving this letter, I contacted Wells Fargo and spoke with a person in the Executive Office who identified herself as XXXX, and informed her that I had not applied online, had reported the identity theft, and had not received a copy of the application as requested. She put me on hold to inquire about my concern, and then told me she could not find any information related to an investigation on the application, instructed me to contact Wells Fargo Card Services and open an investigation. She did not know how to respond to my inquiry about the letter I had previously received from Wells Fargo stating that there had already been an investigation. 

As instructed from XXXX in the Executive Office, I contacted Wells Fargo Card Service in writing and, then, received a letter from the department on XX/XX/2020, indicating that my concerns had been referred to their Fraud Department. A letter received from the Fraud Department requested I submit a notarized Declaration of Fraud which I did dated XX/XX/2020. Again, I requested a copy of the application. On XX/XX/2020, once again, I received a letter stating the investigation into my application concluded it was valid, and was referred to mediation if I still disagreed with their decision. Again, I was not provided a copy of the application. 

Subsequent to Fraud Department 's conclusion, I submitted the information requested to the mediation department, Credit Bureau Dispute Resolution, and haverecieved several benign letters that they are looking into it, blablabla .... I have received telephone messages from a claim representative, XXXX XXXX, who has been no help, informed me mediation resolves disputes about actual credit cards issued, and, basically, is of no help in getting a copy o the fraudulent application, or addressing my concerns. 

I am utterly appalled at the actions of Wells Fargo, and do not understand how the representatives can behave so ineptly in the Executive Branch and the Fraud Department, much less the Mediation Department. It's like they just pass consumers from one department to  the other without giving much thought to the concerns submitted, check off a box that they did their due diligence, and move on to the next issue at hand. It is enough indignity that someone can fraudulently invade the privacy of a citizen and cause undo frustration and financial hardship, and then to have to waste time fighting for justice because of sloppy work. Someone has broken the law and because it seems minor to others, nothing is done to correct the injustice or find the culprits who commit the crimes. 

I have to say that XXXX should be commended for it's swift, just action, and customer service department that really seemed interested in my concerns as a citizen and consumer. It is deplorable that a company as large as Wells Fargo can operate so inadequately and get away with it. How hard can it be to print a copy of a credit card application and mail it to a consumer when the law ( which I provided a copy ) states they are mandated to do so."
3659,"Long history of fraudulent charges from XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
charges are reversed when I visit the bank or tell them via phone. The bank called me called me about the charges on XXXX XXXX XXXX about fraudulent activity and I told them these are not my charges, they said they will take care to it. I asked how much charges for my total on XXXX, he said over {$1000.00}. They do n't seem to want to help me block these incoming charges and discussed with my friend in my presence with my permission last week they think it 's coming from someone in my household when it 's not. 

They issue new cards and explain the transfer of some charges to the new statement. I was told to call the number on the back of the card and I did because the newest charge was over {$1000.00}. 

We showed the mgr the police report XXXX XXXX that the bank knew in XXXX but the account holder did not learn until XXXX. This affects both husband and wife. He closed his account. This WF bank in the past and most recently denied refi due to other issues that are not the issue and used the lower credit score knowing the refi application would be denied. The credit inquiry showed it may be used as negative on the husbands credit report with XXXX XXXX. 

During this discussion at the bank, a manager stated to me ( friend ) the above information with all 3 of us present and 2 s eparate statements that the bank said they could close/block her/wife 's account which would be bad for the credit report. I ( friend ) have explained to her to close this account asap because the bank wo n't block fraudulent charges from the game companies. That 's when we called XXXX XXXX and they transferred us to WF fraud and the 24 hour detection who was extremely rude and horrific to us. 

Other charges appear fraudulent because this bank uses the same store number for the store 3 different cities but same location as in XXXX. 

XXXX, Colorado is the physical location but uses the XXXX, CO as it 's post office service. Receipts are printed with XXXX, CO, but the bank uses XXXX store number and XXXX and XXXX and XXXX for charges on the statement.XXXX XXXXXXXX to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX on page 2 of 3. 

I do n't know what/where the XXXX but I did not protest this charge for {$45.00} on XXXX XXXX XXXX. 2 charges are at the same location/Brighton and XXXX. I do n't go to XXXX on XXXX XXXX. The XXXX/XXXX/XXXX through XXXX/XXXX/XXXX are my charges but not sure about XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$45.00} charge. 

I do n't know what the XXXX store is, difficult to determine if this is my charge or not. XXXX and XXXX XXXX are not my charges. 

We spoke to the assistant store manager at XXXX and someone mentioned something about zoning. Not my problem. This is unusual accounting and tax issues. We noticed this after we left the bank. But notified CO XXXX with the letter from store mgr. 

She/the account holder received 2 letters to her address, one with my first name ( friend ) with her address requesting her written permission to talk to me and WF bank from her and to me stating they now needed her written permission. We discussed this and even if she does give permission in writing I may not talk w this bank. They have treated her and her husband wrongly and they know it. Damaged her husband 's credit and now stating they think the fraud is in her household because the bank manager described his family member of fraud in his own household. 

In my opinion, they are not responsible, they are good, decent hardworking people."
3661,"Three fraudulent super checks were written on my Wells Fargo credit card account. I never use those checks and usually throw out any offers I receive. Some how someone internally from Wells Fargo or externally looking through mail or trash, used three separate super checks to max out my credit card. I had not used the account in nearly a year it had no balance. I only use one credit card, from XXXX, but have several I dont use. My credit score was over 780. I have tried to report this fraud for over a week and nothing has been done. They say they need to do a 45 day investigation. They are going to ruin my credit score and I dont even know what the fraud is. Where the checks were used. No one has any answers or any reassurance I will not be made responsible for this fraud."
3665,"I have a Wells Fargo Home Projects Card and my normal monthly due date is XXXX of each month. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I thought I had missed the scheduled payment that was due on XX/XX/XXXX so I submitted a payment on XX/XX/XXXX. I realized later that I had made this payment earlier in the month. Since the billing date is approximately XX/XX/XXXX for the XXXX due cycle, I called customer service and asked if it would be possible to back of the XX/XX/XXXX payment and reapply it as payment for the XX/XX/XXXX monthly. During this call I was advised they would facilitate the request. I was not told how long this would take and was unable to obtain any written confirmation, but I was assured this adjustment would be reflected on my next Statement and this would be record of the correction being made. Needless to say, that didnt happen. First I was assessed a late charge and then the XXXX statement cycle reflected I was past due. 

This prompted another call with customer service and still I was unable to get resolution. When I asked if I had to complain to the BCFP and OCC to get resolution, the customer service agent transferred me to the Executive Office. Apparently defrauding customers to meet sales targets is not the only issue that prompts this stellar organization from sending me to the damage control team these days. ( sarcasm intended here! ) Its now XX/XX/XXXX and I can only report that the late charge was reversed. Since I fear a 30 day mark will result on the "" missing '' payment while I continue waiting for resolution, I decided to make a payment. ( Heaven knows I don't want to try and resolve THAT issue with this organization! ) If I knew this fraudulent organization was going to jerk me around so hard, I would never had made the request and chalked this up to a shame on me. Or even better, maybe they could have ( should have ) just told me my request was not possible. What I was hoping to be a routine customer service matter has turned into a complete fiasco. 

Their case # XXXX. 

In closing, I guess it could be worse ; I could have been a victim of ID Theft and realized a fraud deposit account had been opened there by an employee trying to make unrealistic cross-sell targets. SMH."
3667,"On XX/XX/2020, I went into my bank account to check my statement and noticed that my credit card was over it's limit. I knew I had not made any payments to go over the limit so I checked my account details. Turns out on XX/XX/2020, 10 different payments were shown on my account all in different states and cities adding up to almost {$6000.00}. The payments started at {$980.00} and then 9 other payments around {$480.00} all for different companies and all in different cities/states. Looks like the account reference number is the same on most of those accounts. The payees are all different, and most look like they are fraudulent companies. I NEVER got a notice from the fraud department. I never got a call, email, any notification. I have never spent {$6000.00} in one day for as long as I have had my credit card, and most of the cities these transactions were in I had never been to. I was shocked that I had no one from Wells Fargo help me or notify me before I noticed it myself by chance. I called Wells Fargo and received terrible customer service as I was frustrated and upset at the situation. They canceled my credit card, said they would send a new one the next day, but I won't receive my money until the claim is settled by the investigation which would be from 2-10 business days. I am unsure of what to do, and feel like I got no help."
3670,"In XX/XX/2018, I signed up via phone for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card, it came with a signup bonus of XXXX points after spending {$3000.00} within 3 months. I met the spending requirement within the 3 month time period, however when I called in after the 3 month period I was told that the offer of XXXX points was removed from my account. I was told by the representative that on XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo re-did their reward program and that the bonus promotion was removed from my account and replaced with a 3x points promotion on future spending and that I would not receive the bonus points that were offered when I signed up for the card. I requested a supervisor and requested a case be opened, but was told there was nothing they could do to help me further as the bonus I was offered when I signed up for the card was no longer in their systems.."
3671,"I received a 0 % interest offer for a 15 month period. I applied requesting several balance transfers equating to over {$10000.00}. It was denied but I was given a {$1000.00}. credit card line of credit. 

I thought that was the end of it but then received a letter from Wells Fargo stating they had initiated a {$650.00} transfer. This is not what I requested and is not helpful. The intent with the balance transfers was to reduce my payments each month, not add another. By completing a partial balance transfer it has resulted in another payment and has only reduced a balance slightly. I did not approve nor do I want this transaction. Partial balance transfers are not helpful. 

In addition they charged a {$19.00} fee to conduct the transfer. 

My attempt to resolve their error was refuted stating it is complete. 

I did not approve a partial transfer. They are unwilling to correct their error so I am seeking outside arbitration for resolution. 

Thank you"
3673,"Wells Fargo Fraud Claims Department will not process my fraud claim, and asked me to fax my claim its Reconsiderations Department. I filed an FTC Identity Theft Report, and was told by a supervisor named XXXX in the Fraud Claims Department that I could be liable for fraudulent purchases made on my account after I made a payment on my account. Mind you, both payments made were on concurrent days, one by phone and one online, and neither payment would show me account activity that could have alerted me to potential fraud. Further, I am being told, when similar fraud has occurred on my other credit cards, as in an entire account take-over, those fraud claims have been resolved, yet Wells Fargo tells me it will take 30 to 45 business days to resolve this claim. I am currently applying for mortgages and can not have this high revolving credit account appear on my credit report and bring down my credit score, affecting the kind of mortgage I could possibly get. In addition, I have sent proof to Wells Fargo verifying my whereabouts when certain fraudulent charges were made, making it impossible for me to have made these fraudulent charges. Please help me have Wells Fargo resolve this claim timely so I can apply for a mortgage and get the best rate possible, keep my credit score intact, and allow me to regain control of my life. The Reconsiderations Department at Wells Fargo does not have a telephone number where I or my Consumer Protection Attorney can contact them to discuss this claim, as I want to be proactive and not reactive, especially given the large money amount involved and the extent of identity theft with this and my other credit card claims."
3676,"I was shocked when reviewing my credit report and found a late payment on the date below : 30 days late as of XX/XX/2017 60 days late as of XX/XX/2017 90 days late as of XX/XX/2017 120 days late as of XX/XX/2017 150 days late as of XX/XX/2017 I am not sure how this happened. I believe I made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my statement did not get to me.

Also all 3 credit bureaus have reported different months being late. This is not accurate and a violation of the FCRA"
3677,"On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX I received an email from XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX informed me that my Wells Fargo Credit Card account has been closed. So, on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX I called Wells Fargo Credit card Department at XXXX to get some information on why wasn't I notified through them in write, email or a phone call to let me that my credit card account we being closed my their company. One person didn't give me a explanation on why the didn't notify me and the other person when I called back to make arrangements and to see if the account would open back up this person told me the account was closed for good and they're going to add late fees and inerest on the closed and account. When I asked her why would the keep add of those fee 's when their are then one who closed my account she told me that's their policy."
3678,"I bank with Wells Fargo and on XX/XX/XXXX I tried to use my card at it was denied. I called Wells Fargo to check to see what happened and it was discovered that my card had been used to make several transactions that weren't made by me and we reviewed and identified all of them. It amounted to approximately {$2200.00}. They were very understanding and reversed all of the charges. Time passed and I never heard from the bank then on XX/XX/XXXX I noticed that some of the charges were put back on my account and my balance went up. I called and I was told that at the time I reported the original claim, Wells Fargo customer rep had not processed correctly that it was not forwarded to the Fraud department which is the department that investigates this. At this time as asked what is the process and what is going to happen because I did not make those charges. They asked me if I had lost my credit card and I told them that I had not. So they said they would investigate and will get back to me. I never heard from them until I received a card in XXXX stating that my claim had been denied and that since I did not say I had lost my card that they were denying my claim. I asked why no one ever called me and they said that they didn't need to it was already determined that somehow I made those charges. At that point I asked for the evidence that I had made those charges. There were charges of like {$1.00}. and some of like over {$400.00}. I told them to take my credit history with the bank into consideration. I have been with Wells Fargo since XXXX. Clearly they can see that I mostly use this card as an overdraft protection. Why all of a sudden would I use a credit card all in a matter of days directly with the card and for charges that make no sense. Like I mentioned {$1.00} at a liquor store. I told them this was someone that was testing to see if they could get away with it. I asked for them to open another claim and this time would they please call me and ask for my input or give me updates as to what is happening but honestly Wells Fargo never did. I escalated this to the Executive Department but again never got it resolved. Wells Fargo never bothered to call me to get any input or to give me updates. I even offered if I should do a police report and it wasn't until the XXXX time that I kept requesting claims that they said "" sure you do a police report if you want, but it really won't help your case. '' I went ahead and did a police report, I went to the police station and due to covid I had to do it online which I did. All Wells Fargo kept telling me that unless I said I lost the card that they would not reverse the charges. I never lost the card and I was not going to make up a lie and file a police report with a lie. I really thought that Wells Fargo would figure out what happened but it just never happened. I have been struggling but still making my payment and I am so upset because I had worked so hard to get my credit score up and this just totally is messing me up and costing me a lot of money in fees and all of this because Wells Fargo is not doing their job. report work full time it is very stressful and I tried to get keep fighting but I need someone to be on my side. Wells Fargo is just not responding or protecting me as a consumer. I hope you can look into this and get it resolved. I just need those charges and fees reversed. I am a responsible adult and I pay all of my bill and handle my responsibilities and I will also fight for my rights."
3685,"Context : Between XX/XX/2018 and XX/XX/2018 there were payments, purchases and cash advances made on a replacement Wells Fargo Visa credit card that was stolen from me, in the mail, before it reached my home address. The new credit card had the same number as the credit card that it was replacing. Wells Fargo is charging me with {$17000.00} dollars that I should not have to pay. 

Wells Fargo has been unresponsive to my requests and states that it does not consider that these transactions are fraudulent. It has failed to investigate the origin of the funds and the accounts from which more than US 30,00 dollars were deposited to my credit card and that I did not make nor do I recognize. 

Fraud claim on my credit card : The purpose of this letter is to assure that I do not recognize any of the following payments, other credits, cash advances and purchases performed between XX/XX/2018 and XX/XX/2018. ( The only exception being the {$9.00} XXXX charge in XX/XX/2018 ). 
Transactions that I do not recognize : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Previous Balance {$9.00} {$0.00} Payments - {$9.00} - {$12000.00} Other Credits {$0.00} - {$18000.00} Cash Advances {$5900.00} {$10000.00} Purchases, balance transfers and other charges {$9.00} {$37000.00} Fees Charged {$290.00} {$600.00} Interest Charged {$36.00} {$140.00} New Balance {$6300.00} {$17000.00} Additionally, there were two {$400.00} phone payments made from my Checkings and Savings account in XX/XX/XXXX, to the credit card, that I did not make. I would appreciate that once the investigation is concluded the {$800.00} dollars that were taken from my accounts are returned and deposited back into my savings account. 
I never received the new credit card that was sent out in XX/XX/XXXX / XX/XX/XXXX to my address in XXXX I did not receive the new credit card that was sent out to me in XX/XX/XXXX / XX/XX/XXXX that replace my old credit card number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; expiration XX/XX/2018 ; security number XXXX I would like for Wells Fargo to provide me with the proof of who received the replacement credit card that was supposed to arrive to my home address in XX/XX/XXXX. 
There were two credit cards with the same number, this generated confusion When I first called Wells Fargo to state that there had been fraudulent activity in my credit card I was asked if the credit card was in my possession. In the more than 10 times that I called Wells Fargo I stated that the credit card in my possession was the number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; expiration XX/XX/2018 ; security number XXXX. ( please verify this in the call recordings ). 
I did not know that there was a new credit card with the same number as the old credit card. I never received the new credit card with which the fraud was made. I was never told in any of the calls that the expiration date or security number that I was listing were wrong. 
When I returned the call of XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX I was asked if the credit card was in my possession. I explicitly asked the person on the line if there had been a new credit card issued with the number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, because I had the suspicion that the credit card that with which the fraud had been made was a new credit card that had been sent out to me and that had been stolen. The person on the line told me that there was only one credit card with this number. Because of this I said that the credit card was in my possession, but I was always refereeing to the credit card expiring in XX/XX/2018. I did not state in any of the calls the expiration date and the security number of the new credit card because it was never in my possession. 
It was only after calling many times that one of the assistants told me that the security number that I was giving did not match the number in the credit card with which the fraud had been made. Only at this moment did I understand that a new credit card had been issued with the same number as the old credit card. 
( Attached a copy of my old credit card ) There were purchases in XXXX, I have not left XXXX in the past eight months In the calls that I made I clearly stated that there had been purchases in XXXX and that I had not been to XXXX. I also stated was that my account had been hacked and someone had reported a trip to XXXX on my behalf. 
( Attached proof that I have not traveled abroad for the past eight months list of my flights listed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX ) The purchase on the XXXX account was due to a subscription I have had for years In XX/XX/XXXX and in XX/XX/XXXX there were payments made on the new credit card by my XXXX subscription. When you have a subscription the credit card number is stored in the system of the merchant. When a payment is due, if the credit card number has not changed, the payment will go through. You can check the credit card statements for the past 24 months and you will find the payments to this subscription. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter notifying that my pin number to the credit card had been changed In XX/XX/XXXX the Pin number for my credit card was changed. Instead of sending me an email, Wells Fargo sent a printed letter to XXXX that took 30 days to arrive, notifying me that here had been a Pin change in my account. I could have reacted much earlier had I known of this situation before. 
I was not checking the account because the credit card was expired I was only logging into the credit card account once per month to check if there had been any charges from XXXX. This was a credit card that had very little activity and you can check this by the activity of the las six months. Because of this I was not aware of the fraudulent activity that occurred with my account in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX The credit card should have never been allowed to go over limit The credit limit in my credit card was {$8500.00} dollars. It is inconceivable that Wells Fargo allowed the Credit Card to reach a balance of {$17000.00} dollars. 
The credit card was stolen by a sophisticated criminal organization One of the key points that worries me the most about the rejection of Wells Fargo to accept the fraud claim is the lack of understanding that there was clear criminal activity. Wells Fargo not only failed to stop the activity while it was occurring, it failed to recognize it and support me when I called to declare that there had been fraud. 
There were obvious signs that there was suspicious activity and Wells Fargo did nothing to stop it - There were 75 cash advances worth {$16000.00} dollars in one month -> I never made any cash advances with this credit card in the four years that I had it - There were purchases worth {$37000.00} dollars when the credit card purchases performed in this credit card had never surpassed {$4000.00} in a month My personal information, including Social Security number, was stolen.

- For this criminal organization to activate the credit card and change the Pin number they must have had all my personal information The credit card received payments for {$12000.00} dollars to manipulate the system - There were phone payments made to the credit card - I would expect Wells Fargo to investigate where these payments came from since they were made from an account linked to this criminal organization - Of these, {$800.00} dollars came from my Savings and Checkings account, I would expect this money to be returned back to me since I never ordered these payments There must be a security breach within Wells Fargo or the Postal Service Company - By analyzing the way that the credit card was manipulated to surpass its credit limit, the huge payments made to the credit card and personal information stolen, it is clear that the credit card was stolen by a criminal organization - If the credit card had reached the wrong address most probably the person receiving it would not have had the capacity to conduct a fraud of this magnitude"
3686,"On XX/XX/2019 I went to Drive through of Wells Fargo on XXXX XXXX XXXX, PA. And retrieved money. The agent who assisted me reached out to me and informes me she gave my Driver License and Debit car to the wrong car and she was going to call them so they can return it. She asked for my phone number so she can call me when they drop my card off. I parked and immediately I went inside to talk to the manager. All they say was they can cancel my card and give me a new one. I brought to their attention whoever got my card they knew everything about me. My name, date of birth, DL number, My address, everything and the manager stated again all they could do was to give me a new card. So I am reaching out to you because I am extremely upset and their own policy is to protect my personal information and they violently that. They didnt care or were careful they just gave it away."
3689,I have received multiple offers of a limit increase if I spend so much in purchases in a short time frame. These offers have been occurring for a year now. I use the card however have fallen short of the required amount. Not really knowing the exact timeline of the offer expiration I seem to miss the permanent increase. My limit drops THEN I get another offer the following month saying IF I use this amount I get to keep the increase. I feel like it's a yo-yo game and the brief moment in between offers my balance dti is50 % or more affecting my credit. Is this bait and switch ethical?

3694,My Wells Fargo Credit card is inactive and I have been trying to pay it off and close the account for a couple of years now. Automatic payments were set up through Wells Fargo on three different occasions. These payments of {$200.00} a month were dropped at least twice. Back payments and late fees accumulated.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Wells Fargo Financial National Bank regarding the incorrect payment being applied on XX/XX/XXXX that was different from what I had requested.

I stated that I wanted to pay the balance immediately, as I had requested previously, and have the interest taken off my account.

I was told by a customer service rep that there have been numerous complaints regarding opt out vs opt in, yet Wells Fargo has not changed their procedures."
3716,"Hello, I'm submitting this complaint because Wells Fargo failed to properly resolve my dispute of a XX/XX/2022 charge. I have spoken to Wells Fargo employees more than a dozen times and sent follow-up letters providing information they indicated would be useful. The matter remains improperly unresolved, with Wells Fargo providing vague and inconsistent information about the decision and process -- when it provides any at all.. 

Wells Fargo has provided frustratingly little information about its decision. Its written communications : 1 ) merely assert that the charge was valid ; and 2 ) attach a copy of the merchant 's terms that is different than the terms that were not in effect when I made my purchase ( which I can prove with screenshots ). 

Consequently, my primary source of information about the decision has been calls with Wells Fargo 's dispute department. During these, supervisors repeatedly asserted that it does not matter that the merchant 's service was not "" as described. '' Rather, they have stressed that the only thing that matters is that the merchant provided a service and I used it. I don't believe that this is the right standard. 

In addition, procedural irregularities have characterized Wells Fargo 's treatment of this matter. For example, the case manager refused to talk to me, his memo made little sense when someone else read me its reasoning, and no one allowed me to respond to the merchants reply before dismissing my case ( despite multiple promises that Id be allowed such an opportunity ). Similarly, Wells Fargo provided told me that I could request to open the claim, and then told me I couldn't, and then said I could, and then ultimately refused to allow this -- all while promising to explain its position in writing and failing to do so."
3717,"I have a credit card that was hacked. It had a balance of over {$5500.00} before the hack. Then it was hacked and they made charges to total the balance of over {$11000.00}. We tried resolving the issue with wells Fargo and they verbally communicated the transfers were made over in XXXX. We have never seen statements indicating this. They refuse to even send physical proof of their words. We have never left the country in the past 10 years. Wells Fargo refuses to credit the account back to original balance before the hack because they said the account was logged in and out from a credible account in XXXX. Wells Fargo froze the credit card and we are fine with that. We just want to go back to the original balance, pay that off and be done with wells Fargo."
3718,"I sent Wells Fargo and there registered agent a billing error notice. They have 30 days to fix it. As a consumer, they failed to apply a credit that I am due, and also, they withheld this disclosure from me. Pursuant 12 CFR 1026.13, this constitutes as a billing error. Wells Fargo is notorious for shutting down consumer 's accounts due to us exercising our consumer rights. Pursuant 12 CFR 1026.11, when a credit balance in excess of {$1.00} is created on a credit account ( through transmittal of funds to a creditor in excess of the total balance due on an account, through rebates of unearned finance charges or insurance premiums, or through amounts otherwise owed to or held for the benefit of the consumer ), the creditor shall credit the amount of the credit balance to the consumer 's account. Refund any part of the remaining credit balance within seven business days from receipt of a written request from the consumer. Make a good faith effort to refund to the consumer by cash, check, or money order, or credit to a deposit account of the consumer, any part of the credit balance remaining in the account for more than six months. No further action is required if the consumer 's current location is not known to the creditor and can not be traced through the consumer 's last known address or telephone number. Also in my letter I stated what they can and can't do to the consumer. I feel as Well Fargo has taken a advantage of me for a long time. They withheld this disclosure while I was paying them when I was due a credit. I have been with Wells Fargo for over 15+ years. Im demand my credit be applied every month as stated. The same letter was also sent to The XXXX Attorney General."

3724,"I applied for and was approved for a XXXX XXXX  XXXX issued by Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. I later received the card and made one purchase to my rental property. on XX/XX/XXXX I was informed that the three charges had been attempted on my card, all fraudulent. I then was asked to confirm if the charges were fraudulent and ended up in an hours long loop of customer service representatives, which ended up wasting the better part of a morning in order to cancel my card and have a new one sent. All of this for what was undoubtably the fault of Wells Fargo, who clearly had a data breach given the length of time I have owned this card as well as the lack of use. The amount of time and effort expended to resolve this problem from the consumer sides feels both unfair and almost punitive, given the fault lies entirely with Wells Fargo."
3725,"I paid off my balance on my revolving Line of Credit with Wells Fargo on XXXX. It was a business account. They withdrew {$120.00} from my personal Credit on XXXX even though there was a XXXX balance.

I took it to my bank on XX/XX/21 and they told me they couldn't cash it because it was in a business name and to take it to Wells Fargo who submitted the check. I went to a Wells Fargo Branch, waited over 30 minutes in a car line but they said since I didn't have a savings or checking account at Wells Fargo that they couldn't cash it. The Branch Mgr. said that he would give me a telephone # to call and that they would mail me a check overnight. I spent over two hours on the phone with 5 or 6 departments. No one knew how to fix the problem. They called the Branch Mgr. and he said that he didn't tell me that. I asked that he be reprimanded for his lie to me and to them. They said that another dept would call me back later. I received a call on XXXX from that other department. They informed me that were recording the call. I then informed them that I was also. She put me on hold, came back on and stated that the conversation was over since I was recording. She then promptly hung up on me. They took {$120.00} from my personal checking even though I had a XXXX balance. I want my money and now they won't even talk to me. I told them yesterday to simply send me a check in my name since the funds were taken from me and express mail it but no one at Wells Fargo was smart enough to figure out how."
3731,"Last year, around this time, I attended an expo home show. The XXXX XXXX XXXX salesman informed us that the mattress we liked and tried in the showroom would be the one we would purchase. Because this company is based in Massachusetts, we are already apprehensive about purchasing it. Our two king-size mattresses were delivered to our residence on XX/XX/2021, however. After trying them for a few days, we felt that the mattresses did not feel or look like the ones we tried at the expo. The mattresses appeared cheap and felt like bricks. Several days later, we contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX numerous times at the number on our receipt, XXXX. However, the mailbox was full at that time. After many attempts and months to contact the company, I was forced to seek the assistance of the third party, Wells Fargo 's investigation department, who funded the merchandise through credit. I have been in discussions with Wells Fargo 's investigation department to try to rectify the situation since XX/XX/2021. Similarly, Wells Fargo attempted to contact American Sleep Therapy by telephone and by mail for over ten months without success. As a result, Wells Fargo has placed my account on hold for further investigation. Having tried to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX numerous times after my first initial attempt was unsuccessful, I decided to wrap both mattresses in plastic and place them in storage due to their extreme discomfort. The Wells Fargo investigation into this issue has been in constant contact with me since XXXX of this year where they have made multiple attempts to contact American Sleep Therapy by phone and mail, but have not received a response. Wells Fargo contacted me late in XXXX of this year to inform me that they have contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and are offering us a pillow top to rectify the situation. I told the Wells Fargo representative that it was unfair of them to provide us with a pillow top after waiting ten months to rectify the situation. I was told by the Wells Fargo representative that I should contact them to resolve this issue. Having called XXXX XXXX XXXX again, there is still no one there and the "" voice mailbox '' is full. Then I received a letter on XX/XX/2021 from Wells Fargo indicating that they must respectfully decline my claims for disputing the mattresses merchandise we received from XXXX XXXX XXXX. In the letter, it says that XXXX XXXX XXXX wish for me to contact them to make an exchange. I Due to a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, I had to purchase another mattress because I called after receiving this letter, and I still dont get answer from this company. Every time I call in the morning, afternoon and evening I receive the same message, "" Voicemail box is full. '' It was so bad that an employee of Wells Fargo called XXXX XXXX XXXX and reported the exact same message : "" Voicemail box is full. '' I couldn't deal with the XXXX XXXX XXXX mattress any longer. Due to the mattress we purchased, I would have difficulty walking every morning. My wife and I bought a mattress from this company because I suffer from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and we hoped that the mattress would allow me to sleep comfortably without experiencing pain in my body, however, the mattress did not meet the expectations that we paid for. Having to purchase mattresses from a local store, my wife and I have not encountered any problems. In view of the fact that the company was difficult to contact, but have finally responded after ten months, Wells Fargo is asking me to pay a bill. In my view, we have been exploited and I believe that there has been a swindle out of money for something we were no longer using. We have been subjected to a lot of stress and frustration during this process. In order to make things worse, as soon as Wells Fargo receives a reply from the company, the bank sticks us with a bill and back fees."

If they would have compared my signature on file with the one on the merchant receipt it be obvious to see there different. He replied that Wells Fargo doesnt have a signature specialist to do that beside I had contact with merchant and that makes my purchase valid Also informed me I was too late For me to do anything about it and if I had any other questions otherwise I can have a good day please help me with this issue they do have zero liability XXXX that I did mention to the rep and he then told me once again that I had contact with this project and I purchased something so they found a ballot which still doesnt make sense thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon"

3739,"We were scheduled to have a new HVAC system installed. The company, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, sent me a link to apply for a Carrier credit account through Wells Fargo to finance the new HVAC system. 

On XX/XX/2020, I submitted the online application to Wells Fargo. I included my home phone number, which was the only number required for the application. 

On XX/XX/2020, Wells Fargo called and asked for a second phone number. When I asked why they needed it, they said that they were having trouble verifying the number I had included on my application. Yet, this home number was the one they were using to call and tell me this -- since it was the number I included on my application! I gave the person my cell phone number. 

On XX/XX/2020, I still had not gotten a response to my application from Wells Fargo. Since the HVAC installation was scheduled for the next day, I called the owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and asked if he could check into it. He contacted Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo told him that my phone number was not verified and that I should contact XXXX Credit Bureau to address the problem. 

So, later on XX/XX/2020, I opened an account on XXXX XXXX   website, checked my credit file, and noticed that, in the section entitled "" Telephone Numbers Reported, '' my home phone number, which I had used on the Wells Fargo application, was the first number listed!!

So, also on XX/XX/2020, I again called the owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who again called Wells Fargo. After talking to them, he suggested that I call the one number back and continually press "" 0. '' So, later on XX/XX/2020, I was finally able to reach a representative at Wells Fargo. I explained what they had said about my phone number not verifying, and explained that the number in fact WAS listed in my credit file. He put me on hold to talk to someone about my issue. When he returned, he said that my Wells Fargo application had been denied because they could not verify my phone number and for "" credit reasons '' ( which he did not explain ). He said that there was nothing I could do. 

On XX/XX/2020, I received a letter from Wells Fargo that said : "" We are unable to offer you a credit card account for the following reasons : Unable to authenticate identity of applicant. '' On this same day, I received copies of my credit report from the three main agencies. On each report, my home phone number, the one I had used on my Wells Fargo application, and the one at which Wells Fargo had called me, was listed."
3744,"Complaint about XXXX XXXX and discrimination Dear Sir or Madam, Wells Fargo started discriminating against me about XX/XX/XXXX when I asked to notarize a legal letter for me. The personal banker, XXXX XXXX, in XXXX XXXX XXXX, located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NV XXXX, discriminated against me because of my XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX. Instead of notarizing my legal letter she started repeating over and over again that she would not notarize my ID card, which I brought for verification of my identity. When I applied to another personal banker in that branch, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX ( Exhibit 1 ) immediately advised her to refuse services for me because she did not like me, and XXXX XXXX told me to go to another branch, which notarized my document. Wells Fargo denied my complaint about that incident ( Exhibit 2 ), but because of that they cancelled my XXXX XXXX card, which, as they previously confirmed on XX/XX/XXXX, had cell phone protection benefit ( Exhibit 3 ). 
On my CFPB complaint # XXXX, Wells Fargo responded with a letter that my cell phone protection was cancelled on XX/XX/XXXX ( Exhibit 4 ), which contradicts with the Exhibit 3 dated XX/XX/XXXX. The claim # XXXX was filed in XXXX, but it was responded only next year, and honestly, I dont remember neither filing that claim, nor what it was about. Also, Exhibit 4 has a date XX/XX/XXXX and address XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NV XXXX, even though my address in XXXX was XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NV XXXX, which Wells Fargo confirmed with Exhibit 3. It seems like that was either some fraudulent activity on my account or Wells Fargo with XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX discriminated against me confusing me with somebody else, or because I filed a complaint about XXXX XXXX and discrimination at Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX branch by two Wells Fargo employees ( Exhibits 1 and 2 ). 
In response to my CFPB complaint # XXXX provided some fraudulent letter denying my claim # XXXX with XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ( Exhibit 5 ). That fraudulent letter denied my claim # XXXX on the grounds that they could not verify with XXXX XXXX that I had claimed a chain saw even though I had provided verifiable evidence that I claimed the chain saw with XXXX XXXX. Because XXXX was just a benefit XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX member of XXXX XXXX XXXX, I filed an appeal with XXXX, and it was never responded to me. As a result, I had to follow the arbitration policy XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX member of XXXX XXXX XXXX, which was listed in the Guide to Benefits for Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Exhibit 7 ) by filing a dispute ( Case Number : XXXX ) with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX, as a result of systemic racism exercised by Wells Fargo Bank, XXXX, and XXXX employees, I was hospitalized multiple times beginning XX/XX/XXXX, and I had two years to recover my damages ( California Code of Civil Procedure section 335.1 ). There was also a two year limitation for breach of oral contracts ( California Code of Civil Procedure section 339 ) and XXXXour year for written contracts ( California Code of Civil Procedure section 337 ). 
Regardless of multiple requests from XXXX to XXXX and its representatives ( Exhibits XXXX and XXXX ) to follow the XXXX XXXX XXXX member of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX policy written in Exhibit 7, they willfully refuse to follow their own written contract ( Exhibit 7 ). As a result of such willful disrespect to their own policy and AAA rules and procedures, on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX issued a ruling to prohibit XXXX XXXX XXXX member of XXXX XXXX XXXX arbitrate any disputes at XXXX ( Exhibit 10 ). 
Upon filing my complaint with CFPB # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, where I requested Wells Fargo Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Companies from their Guide of Benefits ( Exhibit 7 ), Wells Fargo provided with a false and misleading letter, stating that they were not required to follow the ruling of AAA ( Exhibit 11 ). As a matter of fact, they were required to remove XXXX  from their Guide of Benefits ( Exhibit 7 ), if it was related to arbitration policy of XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Exhibit 10 ). 
I filed another claim with CFPB # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, where I requested again Wells Fargo Bank XXXX XXXX the AAA ruling XXXX Exhibit XXXX ). And Wells Fargo Bank responded again with false and misleading letter which accused me in fraud because of which my Wells Fargo accounts were closed ( Exhibit 12 ). I attached my evidence to this complaint as exhibits to prove that Wells Fargo Bank, XXXX, and XXXX employees systemically discriminated against me to exercise their XXXX XXXX with false evidence."

3750,"I was denied a credit card by wells fargo and everytime I ask WHY I get a different answer. 1st, they said it was because my account with them was closed and it wasn't, 2nd they told me I hadn't had the account long enough, 3rd they offered me the card then denied me and when I asked why they couldn't tell me. I also have an account with them and have not been able to get a replacement debit card for the one that was compromised. They stated they mailed off at least 5 different cards and I have gotten none of them. They said they would let me speak to an executive to resolve the matter, turns out she wasnt an executive but a call center supervisor that couldn't give an explanation as to why I was denied either. So I called back today ( XX/XX/2019 ) and spoke to some one again and told them that I spoke to an executive the day before and now they are telling me they have no record of that, I reminded them that these calls are recorded and If there is no record of that conversation that means they ( Wells Fargo ) lied when they said they were sending me to an executive that could help me. If you cant tell me WHY I was denied the credit card and go through such lengths to lie the only reason I can figure out as to why I was denied is because I am XXXX. I also confronted them with other poignant questions and I informed them that Im an XXXX XXXX and that also seemed to make them treat me even worse."

3770,"In 2022, I signed up for a new credit card with Wells Fargo, N.A. to purchase appliances from a local store for a home renovation. The interest-free period on the Wells Fargo credit card applies during a ~18 month period provided the minimum payment is made timely. What is deceptive is that unlike other credit cards ( e.g., XXXX ) where purchases are made at a specific retailer on a new card during an interest-free period, my monthly Wells Fargo statement does NOT calculate my monthly payment amount so that I will have paid off the purchases during the interest free period/term. Instead, if I paid ONLY my monthly payment, I would only pay off ~ XXXX of my purchase balance by the time the interest-free period ends. This is not clearly explained, and is described on p. XXXX of the monthly statement in the midst of lots of other text ; this important language is NOT bolded or set apart from other terms and conditions on XXXX of the credit card statement. The onus is on consumers to do the math - that is, to calculate that by the time one 's interest-free period ends, one will NOT have paid off the full purchase amount if one pays only the monthly minimum payment. This is very different from how other credit card companies/banks handle these types of interest-free terms for new purchases and should be clearly and separately stated on XXXX of each consumer 's monthly bill. The language should be bolded and put in a box with a red border, and furthermore, Wells Fargo should be required to include a calculation of what a consumer must pay monthly to pay off all purchase amounts during the interest-free promotional period. This is a deceptive practice and it is intentional- the interest rate for unpaid balances increases from 0 % to 28.99 % ; it also is not consistent with the practices of other credit cards companies and must cost Americans millions of dollars each year. The way Wells Fargo presents monthly invoices for interest-free promotional purchases defeats the purpose of an interest-free promotional period for new purchases."
3771,"On XX/XX/2019 received a letter, at my residence, from Wells Fargo saying that my Identity cant be verified & to call. I called and was instructed to visit a Wells Fargo branch with identifying information before XX/XX/2019. 
I went to a Wells Fargo branch and presented my drivers license, electric bill, water bill, social security card, and a couple other credit cards. The advisor called corporate to confirm the necessary information. 
On XX/XX/2019, I received another letter, at my residence, stating Identity cant be verified. 
I again went to the same branch and the same advisor made additional copies of my identifying information. She also called Wells Fargo corporate, to verify that all the information was received. 
On XX/XX/2019, I again received a letter, at my residence that my Identity cant be verified. 
For a third time, with the same branch advisor, I went to Well Fargo and asked what was going on? The advisor called again and asked that I provide the verifying information including drivers license again. 
Instead I said that I did not understand how this situation had escalated or could not be cured given all of the documentation and physical visits to the branch. 
I said that I was concerned my identity was being compromised and because the original credit card offer came via an offer to apply via XXXX, a credit bureau, and that Wells Fargo was in possession of my full credit report, in addition to having me physically appear in the same branch office three times, to please withdraw the application and destroy the file. The advisor said she did not think this could be done and instead advised me to be patient. 
All of this activity happened before the Wells Fargo determined cut-off date of XX/XX/2019. 
I then called XXXX  to ask what the issues were and the XXXX account executive suggested filing a complaint because of the unusual nature of the situation and to protect my identity from fraud or other misuse.

3772,"I had a XXXX limit CC with XXXX XXXX  and a XXXX limit CC with Wells Fargo prior to 2020. During the pandemic ( ~May of 2020 ) I entered into a deferred status with the both cards via calling the company prior to becoming delinquent and informed both banks that I had been furloughed from my employer, the XXXX XXXX XXXX due to the aviation industry as a whole taking a pause. Thus I would effective-immediately no longer be liquid, due to loss of primary employment. Further, my new income was based upon state-unemployment which was delayed for months in WA state due to a myriad of issues related to the pandemic. 

Nonetheless I called back Wells Fargo XXXX days later ( to continue my deferment ) and Wells Fargo informed me they needed me to call on day 45 to continue keeping my card in open/deferred status ( even though the pandemic still had no end in sight @ XXXX of 2020 ). Thus WF was my first ever CC to be closed. Through many calls I learned that WF needed me to call back just a few days earlier and this issue could have been alleviated, nonetheless WF refused to make any accommodations at that point. Keep in mind the pandemic showed no signs of letting up at this point ( Summer 2020 ) but Wells Fargo had no problem applying "" the juice ''. 

So I called XXXX XXXX immediately to extend my Covid-related deferment, only to find that their time-frame for me to call back was also 45 days or less. However the silver-lining of all of this was my XXXX XXXX  XXXX had a 60-day window ( for Covid deferment follow-up ) and was willing to accommodate me so I remained us a customer ( also noteworthy : XXXX holds my highest limit and is my primary CC but also went into Covid-deferment at the same time as WF and XXXX XXXX  ). 

Consequently I still have my highest credit limit with XXXX but this just goes to show me that smaller banks like XXXX XXXX  and Wells Fargo ( smaller relative to my account and smaller relative to Chase ) must've been taking more aggressive risk-reduction tactics amidst a global pandemic despite the human affect, ultimately inflicting the most pain on people like me, low credit-limit, unemployed by Covid, and low savings individuals.

I was very disappointed that I was being preyed upon by mid-tier Banks at a serendipitous/unscrupulous moment for banks to close-out ( low limit ) credit cards that were in Covid-deferment status quicker than normally would have pre-pandemic. Ultimately I suspect that due to these accounts ' high doubt of repayment because they were in Covid-related deferment and low-limits, that is why it was in the banks interest to have them closed. If they wanted to keep them open, policy would have allowed for it. WF settled with me for ~60 % of the XXXX limit. XXXX XXXX  remains attempting to debt collect. I am now employed again but I fear I may have hurt my chances with WF because I accepted a settlement. Please help"

3775,"Wells Fargo Credit Card Account XX/XX/2019 Dear Investigating Officers : In early XXXX I received an email notification that Wells Fargo was offering credit card balance transfers with 0 % interest for 18 months. I have a XXXX credit card with a balance of {$6100.00}. I decided to make the transfer to save money. 
I applied online and was instantly approved for a credit limit of {$5000.00}. I called WF and a customer service agent said to wait until I got the card in the mail in order to ask for a limit increase. I did so, and last week received a declination letter. I immediately cut the card up, called WF and told them to cancel this account and mailed the cut-up back to them.

Yesterday I received the enclosed letter from WF. They have transferred a balance of {$4800.00} WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE OR APPROVAL from XXXX to the account with them that I closed. This has broken up one credit card into two credit cards and does not serve any purpose for me other than now having to pay two monthly notes.

I am infuriated by the arrogance of WF. They did not contact me or notify me in any way that they were helping themselves to this amount of money. When I called yesterday a CSR for WF said I would have to contact XXXX about returned the funds. When I did so XXXX said, and it makes sense, that WF simply has to return the funds. 
I have spent the last two days on the phone with Wells Fargo trying to get this reversed. Today I spoke with a lady named XXXX in their executive office. Her English was so horrific that I barely understood what she was saying. Again I kept having disclosures and agreements thrown at me at the time I applied for the card despite the fact that I cancelled this card. She gave me a case number of XXXX, as best I could tell. 
I was aware that WF had been involved in shady dealings over the years, it made national news. But I never fathomed something as desperate as this. 
Finally XXXX deposited the {$4800.00} into my checking account. Today I am sending WF a check in this amount and demanding the account be closed. They are also trying to charge me {$140.00} for a transfer fee and under NO CIRCUMSTANCES will I pay this. 
Your help in this matter is most appreciated. It would seem that further investigations into Wells Fargo should be initiated. 

Thank you XXXX XXXX"

I was unable to login to my account when I changed my password in XX/XX/XXXX and needed to contact Wells Fargo. I finally paid to get an international phone card to call in and get access to my account today. Got logged in and found out my credit card was closed due to a XXXX balance. They sent mail to my old address even though I clicked email for account related information. I called to get more information and they marked my complaint but was unable to reopen my card. This will now effect my credit score due  to their services on not being able to inform me prior to closing the account.

Its bec im a poor credit person they can do that to me. This is not right ... and i cant even open a new account to otsher bank..
3781,"I tried to consolidate my credit card debt on my Wells Fargo card. I applied and was approved for a personal debt consolidation loan to pay this card off. The lender ( XXXX XXXX ), as per its course of business and policy, mailed the check, for {$8500.00} to Wells Fargo. On XX/XX/XXXX, I saw on my XXXX balance that my debt had been reduced by {$8500.00} ( the amount of the check ). I then used the card to make purchases because the balance had been nearly paid off via the loan check, as was reflected in my account. Five days later, XX/XX/XXXX, I come to learn Wells Fargo rejected the check. I found this out because my balance statement, that initially showed {$8500.00} was paid off via the lender check, was now back as a balance on my account, listed as a "" payment adjustment '' with NO additional explanation. On top of this, I now accrued an ADDITIONAL Overdraft/Overlimit fee for the purchases I made based off the original statement, which again, accepted the payment. 

I called Wells Fargo several times for information. I explained that XXXX sent a check for the amount. It was a debt consolidation loan, standard issue, from another well-regarded financial institution. Wells told me that the check was rejected because they were unable to verify the account. But how can this be when it was first applied to my statement? How could they not verify the account but still show the amount on my statement? Wells Fargo would provide NO further information. By this point, I'd accrued an overlimit fee, as well as a {$27.00} dollar fee inexplicably assigned to my account for Wells rejecting XXXX 's payment. Wells Fargo now expects me to pay {$2000.00} to bring my account back on track. I dont have {$2000.00}. I barely had the regular minimum payment, which is why I tried to consolidate my debt. Now I also have loan bills coming in to pay back the XXXX loan! I wanted to cancel the loan with XXXX as the funds were never cleared and so the loan was never drawn on or applied. XXXX said they needed to see the returned check from Wells Fargo. I called XXXX several times and they told me they dont have the check and can give me no further documentation of what happened. All I have is my statement. The last representative I spoke to, XXXX, informed me that they shred the checks and dont return them. Shredding checks, as a negotiable instrument XXXX refused to apply, is absolutely unfair and deceptive behavior. And the over the limit fee they charged me on top of this is abusive. They are in violation of UDAAP with their handling of this, and they are hurting my credit score when all I attempted was to pay off what I owed them. 

My statement from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX STILL shows the {$8500.00} as "" Payment, thank you '' followed by "" Adjustment -- Payments '' where the money is inexplicably returned to the account balance. I have attached this statement for review. I want my fines reimbursed and I want to close my relationship with them. They do not want to be paid off ; they want to keep their borrowers as hostages. This is shameful. Please investigate this."
3782,"On Thursday XXXX XXXX, 2022, at approximately XXXX XXXX, a lady from Wells Fargo called on my cell phone. She said someone was trying to open up a business account and drain all my money from my accounts. I went to my desk computer to check. She asked if I knew someone called "" XXXX '' from the "" XXXX XXXX '' and I said no. I said there was nothing going on so far in my accounts. She said things may not post until tomorrow and someone would be calling back from the FBI. A man then called. He said his name was XXXX XXXX from the FBI. He said his name, badge number, case number and phone number of the FBI. He asked me to repeat it all back. He said that the person was draining all the money ( which I had only {$400.00} in my 2 accounts ) out of my Wells Fargo debit account and all the line of credit on my Wells Fargo Visa XXXX card. He said I should quickly move them to some government bonds cards found in local stores. All my cards were basically at XXXX and I was about to pay off my used car loan, my Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX loan and be out of bankruptcy soon. It terrified me. 
He suggested trying XXXX XXXX right away since it was large and local. I drove 20 minutes and went in and found none and went back to my car. He called right back and said, just buy XXXX Cards in large demotions to get my credit line safe. The first time there I used my debit card and I pressed the Fraud big red X alert button, so it did not go through. So I moved my 2nd account money over to my regular account to at least make it {$400.00}. The cashier said to try another card, and I did and it went through. I was a little embarrassed that she had to call her manager over. 
Then he asked me to go across the street to XXXX and do the same to get more money safe. He assured me he would send someone over to my house from the local FBI to return the money tonight. I also pressed the Fraud alert button on a {$2000.00} sale. It did not go through, either the first time. The cashier said to try another card, so I used my Wells Fargo Visa XXXX card. It was confusing her, so I said just to refund me, which they did for {$1500.00}, less {$500.00} that did go through. I contacted XXXX and they said the 3 cards that did not go through are not activated or loaded at all with anything according to XXXX, whom I also contacted. Then he suggested going to XXXX 's just down the road. I went in and came out empty handed because they were only {$25.00} cards. I told him it was cold, my heater was broken and that I was getting it fixed next week. 
I still did not realize what was going on. He was very kind and said try one more store before going home because it was getting late. On to XXXX since they were not going through. I also pressed the fraud alert button at XXXX and the 4 gift cards also did not go through. The cashier called the manager and said that I could not purchase more than {$1000.00} per day, perhaps on these cards. I said I had no others with me. I only had my trusted Wells Fargo Debit and Visa XXXX card. So I left. The man then asked me to open the gift cards so the FBI office could track the criminal in action by photographing them. It was getting near XXXX XXXX  and I went home because my fingers wouldn't bend from the cold and visiting 4 stores at night with no heat. He said to go have a good night 's sleep and would call me back in the morning to continue. Since it was so late, he said the money would be refunded tomorrow after finishing. 
It was Friday XX/XX/XXXX and he called at around XXXX XXXX  He asked me to first try XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. I said I was not a member and did not wish to be one. He said he would walk me through the whole thing on the phone as a courtesy. I can not remember if they had a Fraud Alert button, but I did join and got {$2000.00} of cards. Then he asked me to go back to XXXX and try again. I used just different credit cards and the {$2000.00} went through. I was starting to feel afraid that I was not getting to save all my Wells Fargo Visa XXXX credit card money saved from the criminal trying to get all of my money. It was lunch, so he said to go home and eat. He then asked me to open up my desk top computer and open up XXXX and XXXX ( which I was not sure what they were ). The XXXX XXXX  did not work, but he got on my computer with something called XXXX to help me go on XXXX. Then he said you are almost covered for your main bank accounts on Wells Fargo for your limit and so you have other cards? I said yes and I tried my credit cards in various amounts on my home desk computer for XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. More cards were bought. Some went through, some did not, presumably because I pressed the Fraud Alert red X button. He said he would send someone to the house to reimburse me after we were done. 
Meanwhite, I had applied for a job the week before and they kept leaving messages while he was on the phone telling me what to do on Friday. I finally said I had to call them back since I had been unemployed for almost a year and on unemployment half the past year and still in bankruptcy. He even congratulated me on getting the job. Some of these were done at home, some at the store. I was scared I didn't do enough to save what little money I had since I am in bankruptcy and was unemployed most of this year and had to collect unemployment for 6 months living close to the red. I still was clueless as to this nice talking "" XXXX XXXX '' who told me very patiently how to do it all on the phone. It was late again and he said tomorrow on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX, either he or an associate would call me or show up to give back all the money. He told me to have a good night 's sleep and leave my computer on for the night. I did not do that, though, since I turn off and unplug things to save money on my electricity bill. 
I woke up Saturday, looked at my Wells Fargo account showing with nothing except charges on my credit card and my 2 main bank checking accounts empty. I shook and it woke me up to see what was finally going on. He kept on saying to make sure to say nothing to no one so they could do this sting on the thief from the XXXX XXXX.The thief, I figured thought was him. I immediately called Wells Fargo and said that I was a victim of fraud and major crime activities and that all the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX charges should be reversed. I was scammed and felt so ashamed. They were polite and told me they could only take the {$400.00} off that day on my Debit Card and to call the Wells Fargo Credit Card department, because it was a different department. I shook and quickly called it and told the Wells Fargo Credit Card people about all of the fraudulent charges. I told them also to stop all the XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX 's XXXX and XXXX charges as they were fraudulent. He said there was a daily limit as to how many he could take of in one day, so I should call back the next few days for more. Then I spent the next few hours calling all of the rest of the credit cards that were used and they all took care of the frauds I alerted them to. 
I have been with Wells Fargo since XXXX, had my first mortgage with them, also. I am XXXX, on XXXX, considered a vulnerable elder as I live alone with no friends or family in contact with. I also suffer from XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX  and XXXX. I have not been able to function or sleep since I have not gotten this resolved with only Wells Fargo. I have called everyone back since that weekend to make sure they took me seriously and reverse the frauds and stop any more criminals. I got escalated on another call to Wells Fargo to some lady who was so rude and to just figure it is gone, all by me, my fault. I was stunned at the response. I could hardly talk and got severely traumatized how she handled me as a loyal customer. I said a major, major fraudulent crime has been committed no matter what, and I first sought Wells Fargo as my first choice to alert so they flag and correct my debit and credit cards quickly and responsibly. I trusted Wells Fargo to help me, not be mean and cruel to a loyal, longtime customer. Every other card I contacted handled it in a professional, simple way and did the right thing to put people first, not the criminals. They trusted me and instead of Wells Fargo who has fought the fraud and my claims. They reversed the {$400.00} on the Debit Account that they originally credited me in my debit card on the first day. They still won't correct all of the frauds there of {$3400.00} on my XXXX Visa credit card. 
I am in bankruptcy and it has ruined my credit. I do not know how I can pay for all of this crime. 
Wells Fargo has sent me mixed messages every time I called to report the fraud charges again. 
I live on a modest string budget and had so many cards and stores involved. I set up folders for all credit cards and continue to call them to file fraud reports or just report them on the phone. 
Some did not take me seriously the first time, so I am glad I called back. The guy continued to call me back until I figured out how to block him. He called me back on a different presumed "" burner '' phone until I blocked that, too, after I called him scum and hung up. 
On the Tuesday after it happened, a nice lady named XXXX from Wells Fargo contacted to apologize how it was handled and would help and investigate more fully. I felt relieved and somewhat appreciated that they were going to help and do the right thing. The bank "" looked into '' my account for over a month and just informed me a month later they would not reimburse the rest of my claims. I find that refunding some and not others confusing and wrong as I was the victim with Wells Fargo only. Every other credit card has refunded me so far, except Wells Fargo. I have filed reports with the XXXX XXXX # XXXX, the FTC # XXXX, the XXXX # XXXX, the Office of MN XXXX XXXX and the XXXX hope you can assist me in getting my accounts back in order because I do not have the money to pay with being unemployed for so long and in bankruptcy. I think being a long time customer deserves that much and respect, also. I know the pace of technology is fast, and I thought I was always doing the right things. I had all my credit cards back at XXXX, living on a few hundred bucks at a time generated by XXXX and a part-time seasonal job. I almost had my used car loan paid off, my Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX paid off and had to move money around my accounts and trying to wait on Wells Fargo only. All they other credit card companies were respectful and cooperative and nice compared to Wells Fargo so far. Banks should continue trying staying one step ahead of the criminal activity and collaberating with the people who they have long done business with. 
Instead I have ill will, distrust and you have a reputation at stake. Iam considered moving all of my accounts with Wells Fargo to give my business to someone who treats their customers kind and fairly. 
Thank you, kindly.

3784,"On/about XX/XX/XXXX I notified Wells Fargo via phone that I noticed multiple unauthorized fraudulent authorizations/charges on my Wells Fargo Visa card XXXX The authorization attempts and my phone call were on the same day. I hoped my call would halt the transaction. I also spoke directly with XXXX on the same day to advise them of the fraudulent activity. There were multiple authorizations for the same smaller amounts ( {$160.00} & {$53.00} ) which is a very common fraudulent practice and one that Wells Fargo should have alerted on well before I called in. If Wells had proper fraud strategies in place, listened to my original fraud complaint or performed more research by utilizing platforms such as XXXX XXXX they could have determined that the IP address did not match any IP address tied to me. The fraudsters were attempting an account take over. It is a common and well-known practice for fraudsters to test small amounts repeatedly, as was done in my case. Wells Fargo is very aware of this practice yet they determined the charges were not fraudulent. I re-disputed their findings and disclosed that I had received the fraudulent merchandise. The items remain unopened and in the same package and condition I received. I fully disclosed that I did not want to be further inconvenienced by having to return the items to the store. Again, items I did not order. Again, all of this hassle that could have been avoided had Wells Fargo alerted to the textbook fraudulent activities. Even after my re-dispute, Wells did not properly investigate my fraud claim, stating in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that the charges are valid and appear to be authorized by you. Absolutely shameful that as a lifelong Wells Fargo customer that my {$210.00} claim did not receive a fair and reasonable investigation, as is the law. 

Im certain that Wells complete disregard for consumer safety and satisfaction is being felt by countless other consumers that dont know about CFPB so Im hopeful my experience will be a guide for other consumers."
3785,Back in XXXX I called and tried lowering my APR of XXXX but they refused. I have been buying and paying my credit card with the same APR I have been a customer of Wells Fargo since XXXX and they have not considered lowering my charges. I feel like Im a valued customer to them! Ive paid so much interest charges thought out these 13 years!
3786,"On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo Bank closed my personal credit card account without any notice. On XX/XX/XXXX, when I was looking at my online banking account, I noticed that my rewards were at XXXX ( I had a little over XXXX reward points ), and a brief memo was just below my credit card # stating that the account was closed and if I had any questions to call the number noted. I was in shock and furious! I called the # and spoke to XXXX from the executive offices. He said my account was at risk and therefore needed to be closed. He could not give me any further reason and he also said that they can close an account without any reason, but that I should be getting a letter in the mail.

Today, XXXX I received the letter. The letter states, "" Wells Fargo regularly reviews its customer relationships in connection with its responsibilities to oversee and manage risk in its banking operations. After carefully reviewing the risk related to your account, we must advise you that your account is being closed immediately and no additional transactions will be permitted. This decision is final and can not be changed. Wells Fargo 's risk evaluation processes are proprietary and can not be shared ''.

I have had this card for about XXXX years, my FICO score with WF is XXXX, my credit card balance was {$430.00}, I have never been late on ANY payments and I always pay off my balance. I have over $ XXXX in their bank in a savings account. I have text and email alerts on all of my bank accounts with Wells Fargo.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I made an appointment with a Wells Fargo Banker at XXXX. She was on the phone for appropximately 45 minutes getting transferred to several people then finally ended up talking to the executive offices and they too told her that they couldnt give her any information on why my credit card account was closed. When I asked her to ask them that I wanted to see it in writing, that they can close a consumers credit card account at anytime for no reason they told her that it was in the brochure when I received my credit card. Really??????? Who keeps their little brochure with the fine print for XXXX years? That's absurd! I had a credit line of {$14000.00}. I'm also upset about losing all of my reward points! They can go ahead and close my credit card, but I want ALL of my points!

If they don't give me my reward points, then I will take all of my money out and put it into another bank. I have been a customer of theirs since XXXX."
3792,"On XX/XX/2018 4 payments were received by Wells Fargo. Each payment was done by check. Normally, Wells Fargo would post the payment on the credit card account and then the following day the check would clear the Wells Fargo checking account that the checks were drawn off. But this time, that did not happen. Wells Fargo did not post the payments but rather collected the money and then one business day later the payment was posted to the account. 

I contacted Wells Fargo about this issue and was informed that payment can take 1-3 days to post but after explaining to the customer service rep that in the past that was not the case and this only began to happen once the credit card account was closed. I was transferred to a supervisor who explained the same thing but after informing them that my concern was not being addressed, I was then transferred to another rep who continued to explain the same thing to me about payments taking 1-3 days to post. 

I interrupted the last representative and advised them that this only happened after I closed the credit card account and based on the actions of Wells Fargo, this appeared to be a deceptive practice. I was then informed that my issue would be escalated to another department who would be contacting me within 1 business day. I was provided with case # XXXX and provided that department 's phone # as XXXX. 

As I researched further I came upon the last 3 check payments that were sent to Wells Fargo and found the following information : On XX/XX/2018, 3 payments posted to the credit card account {$23.00}, {$26.00} and {$24.00}. As XX/XX/2018 fell on a Friday, the checks cleared my Wells Fargo checking account on XX/XX/2018. 

This is why I believe that Wells Fargo is once again engaging in deceptive practices as other financial institutions such as XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX do not collect funds and then post a payment. The same can be said about other financial institutions such as my auto loan."
3801,"I opened a Wells Fargo Reflect credit card. On my application, I believed to have requested a balance transfer. Upon receiving the card and activating my account, there was no reference to a balance transfer being processed. I requested a balance transfer at that time. The next I logged in to setup payment details, there were two balances transfers processed along with two balance transfer fees. Therefore my credit card was nearly double over the limit and I do not understand how two balance transfers were processed. I spoke online through chat with Wells Fargo along with making a phone call. They stated they could not reverse or cancel a balance transfer after it has been processed. I therefore needed to speak with XXXX to reverse one of the balance transfer payments that was made to them. I then called and explained the situation with Wells Fargo who advised one of the balance transfer fees would be reversed after completing the payment to reverse the corresponding balance transfer that I did not want processed in the first place. Days and weeks later the balance transfer fee is still not reversed, my card is still over the limit, and continues to impact my credit score and finances."
3803,on Monday XX/XX/XXXX i call the wells Fargo reward center about my rewards the customer service why i did n't get my XXXX dollars reward because i already spend XXXX dollars in first three months they check for me saying that the promotion rewards is i need to spend XXXX dollars in first three months i said no then they transfer me to talk to their supervisor the answer is the same i tell them when i apply online they said is i need to spend XXXX XXXX in first three months why now it change to XXXX dollars they said nothing they can do they are cheating me
3804,"I've been struggling to pay my bills since I changed jobs in XX/XX/XXXX right around the beginning of the Pandemic. Shortly after, the virus began and my hours were cut and I began to fall behind on everything. I was receiving some money but just enough to get by. I was anxious about not having enough money and I was receiving unemployment and then that was cut. I then learned my job at the XXXX  would end and I would not be able to receive unemployment because I was overpaid ( {$5000.00} ). I considered Bankruptcy I was going to Food Banks for food and hoping to hit the lottery. I was waiting for my XXXX from the VA to be reviewed but it was pushed back because of COVID. Fast forward to receiving funds after a year and trying to pay everything to catch up. I called XXXX XXXX  to try to negotiate a settlement since they advised my account was closed ; this occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. They told me no after a brief hold and possibly reviewing my bank info because XXXX XXXX  credit card is financed through Wells Fargo which is where my checking account is which I suspect they reviewed and impacted their decision with my account. Be mindful that XXXX XXXX is not the only Creditor I owe. They offered nothing in form of a hardship, so I paid {$1000.00} on my account. Today, XX/XX/XXXX I called to try to get an updated balance and verify the status on the account and ask for late fees, and finance charges to be removed, I was told no again. The reason was because I was given a courtesy removal in XX/XX/XXXX when my account was placed on pause for the Pandemic. So I stated that if a review was completed no other customer would have more than one removal of late charges on their account? I advised I would contact, CFPB, ATTY GEN, XXXX I was placed on hold again. The representative placed me on hold and I was told {$120.00} would be removed from the account bringing the balance down to {$1500.00}. I also confirmed the account is closed and the interest is still at 24 %."
3805,"To whom it concerns, Wells Fargo received a cash payment on my credit card account on XX/XX/2019. Yet, they still show that I owe a balance of XXXX, after making a payment of {$370.00}. The bank representative, XXXX, advised me that it takes 1 to 3 days for the payment to hard post to the account. 

However, in the interim ; I'm still accumulating interest on the erroneous balance of {$710.00}. The representative affirmed this during the call. I contend that this is fraud having been committed by Wells Fargo bank on the consumer. 

Additionally, Wells Fargo is also inaccurately report this erroneous balance to the credit bureaus, as they have in the past. 

I would like the FTC to investigate this matter,"
3810,"I had a Wells Fargo credit card involved in the XXXX Wells Fargo account fraud scandal in which Wells Fargo sales representatives without consent of pre-approved customers created fraudulent charge accounts and collecting fees. Wells Fargo 's corrupt actions resulted in a multiple XXXX dollar law suit and settlement on thousands of accounts. I disputed on several occasions providing written complaints with wells Fargo in XXXX and XXXX. I explained that I was paying my account monthly through their electronic payment process which was suddenly stopped in XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted Wells Fargo and was advised that they had no record of my account. I never received any written, telephonic or electronic notification from Wells Fargo since that time. Upon review my recent credit report it revealed that Wells Fargo had closed my account, charged late fees, and charged off the account as a bad debt. I was never received any written notification or telephone calls from any collection agency regarding my account. As a result of their action my credit score was damaged. In XX/XX/XXXX, I again contacted Wells Fargo by telephone and was again advised that they had no record of my account and hung up. I would like the CFBP to look into this improper consumer behavior and assist me in resolving this matter."
3812,"I don't waste my time contacting Wells Fargo 's card dept. anymore. The calls always end up at corporate with my complaining, because the people they hire are dangerously uninformed, ill trained and inept! So I figure I'll do it this way. When my account balance goes over the limit they report it so fast it'll make your head spin! When my balance is under the limit they take too long to report it like now. I made a payment to bring down the balance on XX/XX/22 for {$210.00}. That payment is not reflected on the report I ran today. I paid on my other credit cards and the payments have already posted and updated. What is XXXX problem? One of my lender 's expressed disdain for them due to their repeated horrible customer service. Couldn't agree more! I made yet another payment on XX/XX/22 which was sent to them today. It won't show up until XX/XX/22. However, they won't report it to any of the bureaus for 60 days! They have been charging me a cash advance fee for 2 years on {$100.00} advance! They try to keep justifying it but it's XXXX and they know it! 2 years charging a cash advance fee expresses their greed and law breaking. The Comtroller of the Currency is too friendly with them so they're a waste of time. As long as I have a balance they'll keep charging me the fees monthly and continue to be uber slow to report to the bureaus the positive info that they fail to do timely. If my other creditors can do it quick why can't they? They're a much larger corporation than those banks are. This just speaks to why no one trusts this bank, and why their customers hate them. Because of them my scores remain low due them leaving negative info on my report longer than positive. I've not had too many instances where they've not been paid on time and there are NO XXXX  day lates of any kind on my account! When I am a little late paying they call me repeatedly daily. When I need help from them with questions or whatever they don't assist but give me a hard time or force me to have to complain to corporate who also really doesn't do much. It's an across the board problem with this bank. I don't foresee them ever getting better. Its gone downhill fast ever since XXXX XXXX was forced out."
3813,"I called Wells Fargo on Monday XX/XX/XXXX to ask if my ex-husband could be removed from my credit card. The customer service representative said because I was the primary card holder and he was the secondary card holder I could have him removed. The customer service representative said I would just need to call the same phone number back and it could be done via telephone. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, based on the information I received, I entered into a written agreement with my ex-husband to remove his name from the credit card and be solely responsible for the debt. This agreement was following the judgement of divorce. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the same customer service phone number back ( spoke to XXXX ) and asked for my ex-husband to be removed. I  was told he could not be removed. I explained that I had just called on Monday and was told he could. She apologized for the incorrect information I received but said it couldnt be done. I told her I entered into a contract with my ex-husband based on the information I received and this is unacceptable. 

XXXX transferred me to the Executive Office to voice my complaint. I spoke with XXXX who said she would assign me a case and case manager and they would review Mondays phone call, their options and get back to me within one business day. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the Case Manager, XXXX, called from the Executive Office and said she was worry I received incorrect information but there was nothing they could do because it is against their policy to remove secondary card holders. I, again, explained the hat I entered into a contract with my ex-husband to assume that debt by removing him from the account and I was now bound to that. She told me there was nothing they could do. I asked if the call was reviewed and she essentially said no but would let the customer service manager know there could be a training concern. 

While I understand mistakes are made, it is completely unacceptable to provide blatant incorrect information that caused me to enter into a contract that I can no longer uphold. My ex-husband has said he will take me back to court/sue me for not following through on this agreement."
3816,"I went into a local Wells Fargo branch to make a cash payment on my Wells Fargo business secured credit card. When I went to go use the card, it was declined. When I called Wells Fargo and told them that the card was the declined they said yes it takes three days to process the cash payment when your credit card is in a over the limit status. I always make my payments in cash at the branch and the credit limit is always immediately available. But they said since i had gone {$25.00} over the limit they were going to take three days to process my cash payment My complaint is why should I have to pay three days worth of interest on credit Ive already paid back and not have access to my available credit because Wells Fargo has to process the cash. Processing is a bank term that should be used when two banks need to process a payment between each other. That is when things have to be verified. There should be no three days to process and verify cash when they input it in the system at the Wells Fargo counter and deposit it directly into the Wells Fargo vault. Theyve probably already given that cash to someone else and its already out the door! Once they take it and give me a receipt thats the process post my payment, stop charging me for interest after Ive made the payment and give me access to the credit line which Ive already paid for"
3817,On XXXX over {$300.00} worth of charges were on my account! I messaged someone changed my password then called several of times!
3820,We have spoke to Wells Fargo mutiple time to put the transaction in disoute as it is a fraudulent charge. We spoke to a Rep on XX/XX/2019 names XXXX He attempted to help us but was disconnected. We asked for a supervior on XXXX  XXXX and one was not avilable my call was taken by agent XXXX and we where promised a call back and never recieved one. XX/XX/XXXX the bank states they called and left a voicemail regarding the sisuation but we do not have a voicemail ... Thus far we have not been able to get the charges in dispute. The charges where put on account on XXXX.. I have been getting collection calls regarding payment for this charge which is not mine ... I can not keep calling in getting empty promises. I have a Zero Libility on Fruad charges on this XXXX ... I expect to use the full extent of that
3826,"I have been trying to work on the fraud that occurred on my account in 2018. I have a credit card that has {$0.00} fraud liability and the company keeps insisting that I was responsible for the charges. 

I have been in contact with XXXX XXXX Research & Remediation Analyst, Executive Office for Wells Fargo. After many phone calls with XXXX, she was finally able to obtain some of the receipts from the many that were disputed. Of these receipts, there are more than 4 signatures that are radically different from how I sign all of my purchases. 

XXXX sent this back to the Fraud department for reconsideration and they have now ( twice ) just closed the case without reviewing the evidence and state that I must provide new evidence. 

I have given them the copies of the receipts showing that the signatures are radically different, including the fact that during two of the transactions that times were provided for, I was at work approximately 35 miles away from the location. 

The company has since and repeatedly put negative credit information on my credit report and has effectively ruined my credit because of this, causing my purchases of cars to increase from 2.54 % APR to over 12 % for the past two vehicles that I have purchased in the past year because they are not willing to honor their {$0.00} fraud liability contract that they have with me."
3827,"I have another active complaint regarding my payment issues involving my Wells Fargo Credit card - complaint file # XXXX - and I would like to submit an additional complaint regarding issues with the process. 

The initial problem started appearing several months ago, when I was making payments via the Wells Fargo website, and using the option to make a payment 'from an external account. ' Every payment I made, regardless of size, started being held for several days, for reasons that were not ever justified. Due to the issues involving holds being placed on payments made in this way, I opted to try making the payment directly from my checking account ( at another institution ), via the online bill pay system. 

The payment is set up to be processed electronically, which I have verified with my checking institution means that the payment will clear my checking account when it has been electronically sent to Wells Fargo. I was hoping this would prevent Wells Fargo from holding my payments in the way they have been for several months. However, today, the electronic payment cleared my checking account - and is not showing anywhere, not even in 'pending ' transactions, on my credit card. I have called my checking institution to verify that the payment was sent, and they have confirmed that it is complete. 

Unfortunately, what this means is that I still don't have a way to make payments to my Wells Fargo credit card, and have them reflected to the card 's balance in a reasonable timeframe. Wells Fargo now has a cleared payment - something that has already left my checking account elsewhere - and it appears that payment is being held in suspense somewhere and not being applied to my card. 

I was, again, not able to find any resolution by contacting Wells Fargo customer service."
3830,"I am a victim of the Woolsey Fires in California. After my family and I were forced to relocate, I immediately contacted all my credit card companies to ask for a forbearance  period as my homeowners insurance was giving me trouble by not issuing payments. I have been forced to liquidate my 401K to pay for additional loving expenses and to replace my personal property that was either ruined by the fire or stolen by the fake contractor hired to ""help "". I was denied Fema because I had insurance and after being denied a loan from the SBA due to delinquent reporting by 2 credit card companies who swore I would not have to make any payments and would not have negative credit reported.
Needless to say, My once perfect credit is now ruined. I was not able to get an SBA loan because of these banks mis representation of my account status. To make matters worse, I never opened the Wells Fargo credit account, the bank illegally did that for me when I opened a savings back in 2014."

3838,"This complaint is regarding a 12 day freeze hold placed on my Wells Fargo Bank Business Platinum business card. 

I realized there was a freeze hold placed on my card yesterday XX/XX/18 after speaking with a Wells Fargo Customer service agent at XXXX pst. I explained that this card is the lifeline to my business and without the card, my business is completely paralyzed. If there was an emergency supply needed or equipment failure there is no way to remedy the problem. I also advised the representative that Wells Fargo never contacted me either verbally or by email indicating that they would be taking this action. The representative did not provide the name or contact information of the supervisor. 

After enduring almost 20 minutes of bank jargon, I repeatedly asked the customer service agent to speak to a supervisor and she refused to transfer the call. I was told that she would escalate the matter and that I would receive a callback within 1-4 hours. A supervisor from Wells Fargo bank never returned my call. 

At XXXXpst, I contacted Wells Fargo Bank to find out what action had been taken to remedy this situation. I was transferred to a supervisor named XXXX XXXX and was told the freeze hold was removed from my card and I was able to utilize the card. She was also advised the funds are available for immediate payment. I was told "" Don't worry We've got your back. '' At XXXX XXXX I attempted to use the card for a small transaction only to discover that Ms. XXXX misrepresented the facts and the card was still unusable. I called back Wells Fargo Bank only to be told that the per Ms XXXX the that the card "" had the freeze hold removed then replaced.

This morning, I spoke to a consumer representative who transferred me to a case worker within Wells Fargo Bank named XXXX. Her contact number is XXXX. She advised me that she needed to contact a different department within the bank and could not guarantee that she could get the freeze hold removed from my account. I explained to her that this is an urgent matter and that the card is the lifeline to the business, I believe that Wells Fargo Bank will continue this deplorable, discriminatory conduct without your intervention."

3840,"This is in regards t o a Wells Fargo Home Projects credit  card. I am a sophisticated consumer with a  XXXX  degree and a high acumen for financial management. I have tried to speak with multiple people at  Wells Fargo be fore determining that this warranted a complaint with the CFPB.     This is my first month with an auto payment on this credit card with the payment due on the  XXXX  of each month. On the  XXXX , I looked at both the credit and my checking accounts on the WF mobile app to verify that the auto payment successfully withdrew the payment. The mobile app did n't show that auto pay was set up, so I did a one-time manual payment to ensure that there would be no late fees and planned to follow-up on how to verify that auto-pay was set up correctly. On the  XXXX  I noticed that both my manual payment as well as auto pay had been posted to the card balance ( see attached screen s hots ). I called ( see attached call log ) Wells Fargo o n the number that the app provided and spoke to a representative who said it was no problem to reverse one of the payments and that it would take up to 10 days. I was given a claim reference number but did n't write it down as I was told that it would also be emailed to me as I had online banking set up. However, I did n't receive an email about this claim. On the  XXXX  one of the payments had already been successfully reversed and added back to my checking account ( see attached screen shot ).     On the  XXXX  I received a notification via  XXXX   ( a  budget management app ) that brought to my attention a {$27.00} fee on th e Home Projects cre dit card. I called tod ay (  XX/XX/XXXX  ) to lea rn why there was a fee for reversing one of the payments and to find out if I could be reimbursed for the fee. The attached call log will show that I called the same number I had called before. This time I was told that I had to be transferred to the specific group withi n Wells Fargo  at  XXXX . Af ter 2 very f rustrating calls, I gave up. On those calls I was told that this was for insufficient payment and/or that I was n't authorized to use that account. As the only account holder and with a bank account with an ongoing buffer of a few thousand dollars ( see attached documentation  ) ne ither of these explanations seemed valid to me. I had explained the above timeline of events and was subtly accused of lying when  XXXX  ( the last person I spoke to  at WF ) said  that my story did n't match with their call or claim logs. He insisted that I was n't authorized to use my account, and hence the fee. He was n't able to go into any further detail. I have attached the  XXXX  statement that shows no further transactions were put on the card and that there is a {$27.00} fee with 28 % interest with no explanation as to the fee.     I am alarmed a t Wells Fargo 's inab ility to explain a fee like this. I felt that I was not listened to, nor heard or respected as a customer. For those reasons, I do plan to transfer all of my accounts to my local credit union. However, I feel that this warrants a claim as it is highly concerning that a retail consumer company charges inexplicable fees and considers it acceptable to not explain them to customers. This fee should be removed from my credit card account."

I made two payments of XXXX in early XXXX one on XX/XX/XXXX of {$500.00} and another on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX.

Wells Fargo did not paid off the 1st balance completely, however spread it out between the three leaving a balance of {$680.00} on the 1st. I called them in number of times to get them to abide by the Credit Card act but they refused to, saying they were in the right. Now as of last statement they are charging interest on the first amount."
3862,Credit card payment was due on XX/XX/19. Payment in full was made online on XX/XX/19 four days before it was due. Wells Fargo sent a payment confirmation saying payment would be posted on XX/XX/19 a week after payment was made. It generated a late charge of {$25.00}. I went into the bank to ask for the charge to be refunded. Request was refused. I said this was predatory and I would be filing a complaint.
3867,"I have a Wells Fargo Platinum Credit Card ( I have had it since XX/XX/XXXX ). I also have a checking, savings, student loan and mortgage with Wells Fargo. On XX/XX/XXXX the minimum payment of {$150.00} was taken from my checking account and applied to my credit card - as an automatic payment. The issue is, I am not, nor have I ever been enrolled in automatic payments. I called Wells Fargo customer service and the first person I talked to said he doesn't see that I am enrolled in automatic payments. He said that maybe someone logged into my account. Of course, that doesn't make sense since they can see that there was never a request/agreement from my online account, via phone or in person for automatic payments. I asked for the payment to be reversed and put back in my checking account since I did not authorize the payment. I planned on paying the minimum payment, but from another account. He told me he reversed the payment and it would be in my account within 5 business days. I told him I still want to know how this automatic payment was made and authorized. He transferred me to someone else. After explaining what happened, again, the woman said I needed to talk to a supervisor. A supervisor came on the line and I explained it, again. She looked into some other things while I waited and she said the only time an automatic payment was setup was when I opened the credit card in XX/XX/XXXX and it was cancelled the same day. She said that typically happens since it may have been something I needed to opt out of and I decided to opt out at the same time as I opened the credit card. I continued to tell her that I still want to know who and how this automatic payment was authorized. I told her that if you look at my account history, I typically pay my minimum payment 1-10 days early and always have. I asked if it's possible that since I hadn't paid it and it was the due date, that Wells Fargo initiated the automatic payment. She told me that it was a good thing that the automatic payment was made because if I didn't pay that I would receive up to a {$37.00} late fee. I told her that that it is my decision to make and if I happened to pay it late and did accrue that fee, that it would be my fault and I would also pay that. But it is not ok ( nor legal ) for Wells Fargo to initiate an automatic payment and withdraw the money from my account without my authorization. She said that she would need to contact another department but they do not communicate via phone and it is not a customer friendly department. She said she would have to email them the issue and they will have to investigate and then add the notes to my account. She said it will take 5-10 business days and I have to call and ask what the results of the investigation are. The will not call me with the details/results of the investigation. Then I asked her to make sure the payment is reversed and the {$150.00} is deposited back into my account. She said that she initiated that request but the Finance department will have to approve it. Since the automatic payment was the minimum due and paid on the due date, if it's reversed it will put my account past due. I said that I was going to make the payment from another account and then noticed it was already withdrawn. I did not plan for it to go past due ( and I have never paid late ). It is not ok that they can take the money from my account without my authorization and then say that they may not give it back because it would make my account past due. It is my money and my credit and my decision to make. I am not sure where to go from here. I don't know how many people they have done this to and what they are getting away with but this is not ok."

3874,"I applied for an opened a Wells Fargo HomeProjects Credit Card in XX/XX/XXXX to finance a home insulation project, which I'll call Charge1. Charge1 was for {$8600.00}. The terms of the purchase was 0 % interest charged as long as 60 equal monthly payments were made. I set my account to autopay and did not have any issues until last year. The required payment was {$140.00} per month. 

In XX/XX/XXXX I finished a bathroom remodeling project, part of which was financed on my existing HomeProjects card. The bathroom project will be called Charge2, and it was for {$25000.00}. The terms of this charge were 0 % interest if paid in full in 12 months. This charge showed up on my online account on XX/XX/XXXX, and my monthly payment was due on the 4th of every month. I increased my automatic monthly payment so that I would be paying the previous {$140.00} XXXX Charge1 ) in addition to the required {$2100.00} per month for Charge2. Over the next few months, my total payment did vary as I decided to pay of Charge2 in 11 months, just to be safe, as I did not want to accidentally get charged interest. 

In the late winter, I decided to go through my statements more thoroughly to make sure I was still on track with my payments. What I discovered is that while Charge2 posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo took my XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$2100.00} and applied it entirely to Charge1, instead of distributing appropriately between Charge1 and Charge2. I don't know why they did this, and no representative I have spoken with has been able to give me an answer. Because of this, Charge1 had a balance significant ; y lower than what it should have been, while Charge2 was correspondingly higher. All payments after this had been properly applied, {$140.00} to Charge1, and varying amounts to Charge2 as I tried to pay it off earlier than the allowed term of 12 months. This first payment was the only one with a problem. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo and asked the representative to please take {$1900.00} from Charge1 and apply it to Charge2, as I intended. I wanted to make sure that {$140.00} remained as a payment to Charge1 so as not to break the terms of the 60 equal monthly payments. I was told they couldn't do that, but I would be allowed a refund. Taking a refund would allow me to pay an extra {$1900.00} the following month, all of which, I was told, would be applied to Charge2. In doing so, the balance of Charge1 would increase by {$1900.00}, and the balance of Charge2 would be unchanged. I agreed, and I received a deposit to my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX for {$1900.00}. 

What I discovered on subsequent statements however is that instead of providing me with a refund, the representative created a new charge on my card called REGULAR. I'll refer to this as Charge3. Charge3 is was listed as {$2100.00}, occurring on XX/XX/XXXX, and Charge3 was collecting 28.99 % interest every month. To date, I have incurred interest charges of {$11.00} and {$11.00}, and since nothing has been done to fix my problem, more interest is still accumulating. I have continued to make the appropriate payments for Charge1 and Charge2 during this time. Charge1 has been given the correct amount each month, {$140.00}, so I am still within the terms of that charge. However, Charge2 is not getting the remainder, as this made up Charge3 is taking random amounts of dollars every month. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I again called Wells Fargo. I spoke with another representative at length, explaining my situation, and asking them to resolve this problem. She explained back to me what I said showing that she did understand, and explained that she would forward the case to the Accounting Dept who would fix it. She told me this process would take 30 days. 

I called Wells Fargo once more on XX/XX/XXXX to ask if my problem had been resolved and was told, by another representative, that nothing had been done, and the issue had not been fixed. I was told that she was again contacting Accounting to fix things, and that she would escalate the matter to her supervisor. She said I would receive a call back by the following Monday. 

I did not receive any call back, so on Monday afternoon ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I called Wells Fargo, again. I was transferred to the supervisor who, while helpful, seemed to have no previous knowledge of my complaint. I spent 78 minutes on the phone, most of which was on hold, trying to explain my problem again. I was finally transferred to the "" Executive Office '' and was told my case was assigned to an agent who would contact me within 24-48 hours to provide the case number, ask for more details, and provide an estimated date of resolution. 

So, here we are today, XX/XX/XXXX, greater than 48 hours after my last conversation with Wells Fargo and clearly beyond the time frame I was promised a call back. I have never been called by Wells Fargo throughout this entire ordeal. I have always been the one to contact them. 

Including my payment on XX/XX/XXXX, I have to date paid Wells Fargo a total of {$29000.00}. I received a refund on XX/XX/XXXX for {$1900.00}, which leaves a net balance of {$27000.00} paid by me to Wells Fargo. There have been 12 months since that time. Charge1 has required {$140.00} x 12 = {$1700.00}, and the total of Charge2 was {$25000.00}, which added together = {$26000.00}. This means I have paid {$140.00} more than what was required during the past 12 months XXXX XXXX - XXXX = XXXX ). Accordingly, Charge2 should be completely paid and should be off my card, and Charge1 should have a balance of {$5300.00} which I will continue to pay for the remainder of the 60 month term. 

Besides the insane waste of time and effort I have had to deal with for nearly 4 months, my problem is that on my last statement, Charge1 has a balance of {$3600.00}, Charge2 has a balance of {$3400.00}, and Charge3 has a balance of {$490.00}. Charge 3 continues to charge 28.99 % interest as well. 

I am not asking for discounts or compensation or anything like that. All I want is for Wells Fargo to fix their mistake. I have attached my official statements from Wells Fargo that show everything that happened. I will attached screenshots showing the calls I have been on with them. The numbers don't lie. I have paid what was expected. I have fulfilled the terms of both Charge1 and Charge2. I have even paid more than was was required. However Wells Fargo refuses to ensure that my payments are properly allocated to these charges. And beyond that, when I tried to fix this problem myself, instead of a refund they created a new charge that has been charging me interest."
3878,I received a letter on XX/XX/23 stating my credit card ending in XXXX was to be closed. I am XXXX with them closing my account as they also closed my checking account recently and have moved my business elsewhere. I am not okay with them taking hundreds of dollars in the reward points that I deserve and earned from them. I want those XXXX rewards dollars sent to me as a check immediately with interest.
3880,Again today ; XX/XX/2019 I tried to sign in my Wells Fargo online account information. It did not recognize me again. I just was re-instated on XXXX XXXX as Wells Fargo sent me a notice there was suspicious activity on my Card in XXXX. I tried to call when I received the Letter via USPS explaining this and my card was placed on hold .. I called and left a message. At that time as the signer wasn't there. He returned my call and refused to talk with me as I could not provide my Verbal password I reset in XX/XX/2019. It had been blocked as it was invalid since XX/XX/2019. It seems when I make an XXXX Purchase. XXXX  XXXX and / or XXXX submits two seperate charges. One for the Purchase for the Product. One for TAXES. Wells Fargo sees this as a breach. I've been breached at Wells Fargo 7 times IIRC.
3883,"I responded to an offer for a Wells Fargo Cashwise Visa Card. They opened the account. I was to receive XXXX bonus points ( {$200.00} ) after I made {$1000.00} in purchases within the first three months.

The offer clearly states : "" 1. To qualify for the {$200.00} Cash Rewards Bonus, a total of at least {$1000.00} in net purchases ( purchases minus returns/credits ) must post to your account within 3 months from the date your account is opened. The bonus cash rewards will show as redeemable within 1 - 2 billing periods after they are earned. '' THIS IS A CUT AND PASTE FROM WELLS FARGO 'S WEB SITE MAKING THE OFFER. 

I completed the {$1000.00} in purchases on XX/XX/2018. The statement period ended on XX/XX/XXXX. Another statement period ended on XX/XX/XXXX. Another statement period should have ended around XX/XX/XXXX. There is no statement on their website as of XX/XX/XXXX but the account has a XXXX balance so there may be no statement generated. In any case, it's been three statement periods and the points have not been awarded. Their website shows that the bonus points expire on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have a screen shot from their account web page that clearly shows : "" Congratulations! You have a pending bonus since you have met the total Net Purchases spend as of today. '' In that pop-up screen, it also says the points will be awarded 1-2 billing cycles after the offer expires. But, that is not what the terms were in the offer. The same screen also shows that the points expire on XX/XX/XXXX. 

It appears as though Wells Fargo intends to expire the points before they make them available to redeem. Even if that is not the case, they have failed to make them redeemable within 1-2 statement cycles as advertised. I paid my propane bill on that card yesterday. I intend to pay that charge in part with those points. However, I have no confidence that Wells Fargo intends to perform on their offer. 

I have made several calls to Well Fargo and gotten several different answers. I have a recording from today where their second level supervisor says "" yes the points should have been awarded already '' and then offers to open an investigation. I opted to be escalated to his supervisor who is supposedly "" executive level. '' I doubt that, however, that person also wants to open an investigation. Whatever investigating needs to be done, should have been done after one of my previous calls. Clearly, when Wells Fargo investigates Wells Fargo, Wells Fargo finds that Wells Fargo has done nothing wrong."

3910,"I applied for a new credit card from Wells Fargo on late XX/XX/2019. The information on the official Wells Fargo mentioned "" Apply in minutes. Get a Decision in Seconds. '' Nowhere in the page or the website of the application of the credit card, did they mentioned that it may take longer than a minute or it would involve additional steps to apply for a credit card. After I applied for the credit card, I received a letter in the mail saying that I need to verify my identity. I called them and went through some prompts. The customer agent told me that was it. A week later I received another letter saying the they still need to verify my identity. They want me to go to the nearest bank, show my ID and bring a copy of my utility bills. My credit score was XXXX before applying. I would have received the credit card, but was denied and it hunted my credit score below XXXX.

I know because I am the actual owner and had the house built. I'm the only one who's ever lived here and have nothing to do with Wells Fargo and would never have anything to do with them. I have mailed them letters demanding they stop and the junk mail continues."
3916,"Wells Fargo Bank opened two credit card accounts without my authorization. For many years, i had a checking account overdraft protection with Wells Fargo. At some point, Wells replaced this with a credit card account. I did not authorize the opening of a credit card. A couple of years later, they opened a second credit card account. 

I did not want the first credit card, let alone a second new credit card. I was in a tough spot though, because i did need the overdraft protection. I'm not sure if I gave up my rights by not objecting at the time, but I know that canceling a card goes against one 's credit score, so i felt trapped. 
After being more than 90 days late on one of the cards, Wells abruptly closed the account and demanded payment in full. 

I don't deny that i have a balance to the extent there was overdraft. I have requested that Wells refund the charges associated with the credit card including all fees and the difference in interest rate. 

I have never used the credit cards to make purchases.

Wells refused to make any concessions. Now we are in court and they are papering me with document requests. Please know that my requests ( multiple ) for my authorization of opening the credit card accounts have been ignored, including by their attorney. 

Is there anything the CFPB can do to help? 

Many thanks, XXXX"
3918,"On XX/XX/2018, I contacted Wells Fargo to ask if my ARP on my credit card could be lowered. The first customer service representative stated, "" We can not lower your APR because it's against the law. We must charge you what the APR was on your original application. '' My APR is listed as variable.

I called Wells Fargo back the same day and spoke with a different customer service representative and asked what law will not allow my APR to be lowered. He stated, "" The government. '' Is Wells Fargo prohibited by law from lowering a consumer 's variable APR in California? 

Thanks."
3919,"I had over {$3000.00} in fraudulent charges to my card from XX/XX/2022 through XX/XX/2022 before I was able to close the account and start the claims process. Wells Fargo has yet to issue my account a credit for these charges, and every time I call the claims assistance line, I'm told that the case is being investigated while I'm still on the line for all the fraudulent charges posted to my account. The high balance of fraud is starting to negatively affect my credit score."
3923,"A payment of XXXX was posted on XX/XX/2022 into my Wells Fargo credit card account ending in XXXX. This payment did not reflect on the statement. The last day of the statement period was XX/XX/2022. Another payment for XXXX posted normally on my account on XX/XX/2022. These payments totaled XXXX. This was more than the total amount due, per the statement. Despite this, Wells Fargo 's software did not recognize that I had fulfilled my minimum amount due. As a result the Wells Fargo system debited my checking account ending in XXXX automatically for another XXXX on XX/XX/2022. This software error resulted in an overdraft and XXXX charge to my bank account. Wells Fargo 's policy on automatic account payment ( clearly ) states that an auto debit will only occur if the total of the payments in the account are less than the minimum amount due. In my case, I had fulfilled more than the minimum amount due. Regardless of this, the Wells Fargo system software auto debited my account anyway on XX/XX/2022 without my knowledge or consent. The next day on XX/XX/2022 I talked to at least 4 representatives who were helpful and polite but were not able to offer an understandable explanation as to what happened. Finally I talked to a credit card account escalation representative named XXXX. She was great, as were all the reps I talked to. She agreed the above occurred. On XX/XX/2022 I also talked to XXXX at the Wells Fargo customer advocate department regarding this. Both individuals ( XXXX and XXXX  ) understood what happened and assured me the issue would be addressed and corrected. However I actually needed to make another call to get the XXXX charge reversed. Sorting this out took 8 calls over two days totaling 135 minutes ( 2 hours 15 minutes ) on the phone in order to have the XXXX charge reversed. I was told the Wells Fargo system would still have a record of a bank overdraft against my account that could not be reversed, at least by the reps that I talked to."

After waiting approximately three weeks I noticed that the new Wells Fargo account showed the XXXX dollars on my statement, but I did not see any credit for that amount on the XXXX XXXX account. I spoke with Wells Fargo customer service and found that they had transferred the money to the wrong account. It seems that there was an error in the last digit of the account number. XXXX  XXXX stated that the number they used was non existent. Wells Fargo does not want to take responsibility for this error even though they were the ones who did the transfer. I have been trying to get this resolved since XXXX to no avail. I am currently paying both financial institutions. I want Wells Fargo to credit my account. This is putting me in a real bind.

I immediately called Wells Fargo and reported the cards stolen. The representative I spoke with verified that some charges had been made at the XXXX XXXX, and I claimed that they were unauthorized. I was assured that I would not be held responsible for the charges. 

A few days later, I received Declaration of Fraud and Forgery documents from Wells Fargo. I duly indicated that the charges from The XXXX XXXX were unauthorized fraud, and returned the signed documents to Wells Fargo. 

On XX/XX/2019, I received a letter from the Wells Fargo Claims Assistance Center stating that they had completed their research on the claim from one of my credit cards, and that they had determined that no fraud occurred. The reason they stated was that "" the merchant verified your personal information, which may include dame, address, phone number email, account number or card expiration date. '' Well, of course they could verify my name, account number and card expiration date, the thief had my card in their possession! 

I then checked my account online and discovered that Wells Fargo had charged back {$4700.00} to my credit card! And they had done it on XX/XX/2019, over 3 weeks before they notified me. This is almost half of my credit limit. 

I called the Wells Fargo Claims Assistance Center to ask what I could be do to reverse their decision, and they informed me that I had to submit my request for reconsideration in a written letter, and that it would take several weeks for them to resolve the issue. In the mean time, I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE CHARGES! All of the complaints I registered fell on deaf ears. 

The following FAQ is listed on wellsfargo.com under credit card security and fraud : What if there are unauthorized charges on my stolen card? 
Through the free XXXX program, you are not responsible for unauthorized transactions that are reported within 60 days from the first statement showing the unauthorized transaction. If your card ( or card number ) is ever lost or stolen, your account is safe. Just report your missing card right away or tell us as soon as you notice any unauthorized activity.

I have been paying the required minimum of {$90.00} a month. One year I did ask the bank for a reduced amount to lower my payment. They closed the credit card line and lowered my payment but did not lower the amount or the interest rate. I now currently owe over {$3400.00}. In the last 7 years I have paid roughly {$7000.00} and the bank is still wanting me to pay off the {$3400.00} for a {$1200.00} credit card loan.

Erasing a 3 year tradeline on my credit bureau & running down my credit. I called the Wells Fargo fraud department on Friday XX/XX/XXXX. And the Wells Fargo rep said they would rush a new card & that I would receive it Monday. Monday come around & I receive NO card. So I called the Fraud department back and they said that I would have to go into a Wells Fargo branch to show my ID. So I went into the Wells Fargo Branch on Monday XX/XX/XXXX with my ID 's. The Wells Fargo banker called the credit card support help. And after one hour inside the branch they said the card is closed. Wells Fargo has wasted my time, ruined my credit, and committed FRAUD.

And Wells Fargo declined me because the inquiries on my credit bureau. My credit is good, but they said the inquires is why the declined me. Wells Fargo will only approve me for a card when they fraudulently open one under my name.

3941,"Dear Cfpb team, I will refer to Wells Fargo Credit card department as WF Everything started when I went over the limit with my credit card without being aware, it has been my first time. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, WF debited without my consent the amount of {$2800.00} from my checking account which went overdraft due than I didn't the entire amount I didn't have any money after this debit I contacted WF and they explained than I am entitled to pay the full amount due than I had exceeded the limit, I mentioned to customer service than it is not possible at the moment to me to pay the total amount due than my monthly income range {$2600.00} from a part-time job. WF refunded my money on XX/XX/XXXX, under the condition than I must make the card payment for that month on my own and not on an ACH which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I expressed my concern to the agent regarding WF attempting to debit the full amount in the future and the agent mentioned than once paid {$360.00} for than month everything will ok. 

I contacted WF on XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX to report their mistake on XX/XX/XXXX, about the debit of the amount of {$2300.00} from my checking account leaving my account overdraft for $ -XXXX. After calling WF and reported my case they upscale my case to the executive complaint department in order to refund my money asap. As we know the world is in crisis due to the virus. I have XXXX  money in my checking account and one my monthly ACH payment was rejected, and one was cover by WF checking account with an overdraft fee of course!! 

In order to cover the full amount I had gone over the limit I enrolled in a XXXX XXXX  credit card to pay my debt to WF and I deposited a XXXX card check for {$5500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, the payment has been reflected in my credit card statement but WF said than is on hold until XX/XX/XXXX and until then the money debited from my checking account will be refunded. 

I had shown my will to pay the full amount I exceeded the limit and I always have been responsible with my debts through ACHs, the regular ACH monthly amount is {$200.00} amount that is on my budget. I had contacted today XX/XX/XXXX two times the executive complaint department and once to the credit card department in order to get extra help in getting my money back asap due to the circumstances of the virus. I do not have any money to cover my daily expenses and their answer is to wait until XX/XX/XXXX that the XXXX Card check clears because is on hold ( I don't know the reason ) I asked them if I can email the XXXX Card letter as proof than my credit card has been approved for {$5900.00} and the check I sent out to WF was for {$5900.00}. One of the WF agents asked to get a document from XXXX card where they committed to cover the {$5500.00} check, something undoable bank does not issue that kind of statement. As a consumer, I feel WF had abused and I feel powerless the banks ' institutions do whatever they want to consumers, is highly proof by WF than consumer 's rights are not respect and banks don't get penalized for this kind of behaviors. 

XXXX XXXX from the executive credit card department refused to provide me with the information of the institution who regulates financial institutions, she said That is internal and her Kindly answer to my help request to speed up my refund do to the virus crisis was YOU HAVE TO WAIT!! I am fully aware than conversations are being recorded by WF so there is proof of what employees violated consumer 's rights just in providing public information. Thank XXXX I found the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

3942,I see multiple 30-60 days late marks which is a clear violation of my right under the FCRA. The company has never responded to any of my attempts to obtain any proof or documentation that will prove this account is being reported accurately.
3945,"To Who it may concern ; This is about the consumer credit transaction entered with your company dated XX/XX/2016 and I extended your organization the credit for account XXXX. I hereby give your company WELLS FARGO CARD SERVICES notice pursuant to 15 usc 1602 ( k ) that your company never provided an adequate notice which clearly and conspicuously mentions the pertinent facts of this transaction.

Wells Fargo Card services didnt even inform me and the cost of credit, with the ONLY evidence of indebtness was just a computer-generated agreement. According to 15 usc 1602 ( k ) the term adequate notice means a printed notice to a cardholder which set forth the pertinent facts clearly and conspicuously so that a person against whom it is to operate could reasonably be expected to have notice it and understand its meaning. Such notice may be given to a cardholder by printing the notice on any credit card, or on each periodic statement of account issued to the cardholder, or by any other means reasonably assuring the receipt thereof by the card holder. 
Since adequate notice was not given as per the above-mentioned section, I couldnt understand its meaning which is a violation under 15 us 1602 ( k ).

Furthermore, pursuant to 15 usc 1601 ( a ) a consumer must be aware of the cost of transaction. Since I was not aware of the transaction, therefore made and uninformed decision and it resulted in multiple billing errors and unfair credit card practices.

From your end, I have not benefited from this transaction which again is a violation of 15 usc 1602 ( p ). According to 15 usc 1602 ( p ) the term unauthorized use means any use of a credit card by a person other than the cardholder who does not have actual, implied or apparent authority for such use and from which cardholder received benefit.

I hereby request you do the below mentioned ; 1. STOP COMMUNICATING THIS ACCOUNT TO ALL!

2. DELETE ACCOUNT FROM ALL RECORDS!

3. A FULL REFUND OF ALL BALANCES PAID!

4. {$3000.00} check FOR ALL VIOLATIONS LISTED.

5. STOP INFRINGING ON MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY!

If you accept my request, I will not escalate this matter to federal court. In case, you choose to disregard and not accept the above requests, a legal action shall be taken against your company for compensatory damages.

3950,"The purpose of this communication is a means to follow up an initial complaint ( # XXXX ). The complaint details how Wells Fargo circumvented mortgage and consumer credit regulations by commingling a mortgage and bank credit line. The lender response to the first complaint left the matter unsettled, appeared to only deflect from the issues identified and most significantly never addressed a proposed solution. As troublingly, I found it difficult to navigate the mechanisms within the CFPB to assist me challenge the lenders bad faith response and willful avoidance of a solution. Accordingly, I write seeking the CFPBs assistance resolving this matter. 

In short, I am a XXXX XXXX borrower with a stable and permanent income. As my XXXX progressed, I followed a financial plan to reduce obligations and manage my household finances. Initially, I had the good fortune and good credit to rely on lower cost shorter-term solutions from the likes of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and others. However, as I awaited my second XXXX XXXX  XXXX and the inevitability of being XXXX  XXXX, I needed a more permanent solution. The permanent plan was to refinance my home and pay-off remaining debt, all in advance of the XXXX XXXX. 

I contacted my mortgage lender ( Wells Fargo ) to refinance and consolidate what remained of my household debt. My initial complaint provides a more detailed account of the subsequent bank actions. In short, Wells Fargo commingled a mortgage with a much higher priced bank credit line to unjustly enrich themselves and put me into what effectively could be an unaffordable mortgage ( combined monthly payment ). They manipulated and extended the duration of the underwriting process. More specifically, at the very last minute, Wells Fargo shorted the existing debt pay off amount with a lower LTV mortgage that would pay them a higher profit. The delayed and now shorted debt payoff amount was replaced with a high interest rate bank credit line that the bank knew I had no other chose but to use. Needless to say the bank credit line was substantially more profitable ( 24.4 % vs 3.75 % APR ) for Wells Fargo. Considering the lower LTV mortgage, the bank had more equity in my home to attach in an adverse event.

The bank knew their delaying actions put me under the extreme duress of an untenable position. Being forced into an alternative higher priced arrangement that effectively eliminated, my Notice of Rights to Cancel ( NORTC ).

Wells Fargos response to my complaint deflected entirely from the issue at hand. It was incomplete and materially inaccurate. In fact, Wells Fargo failed to even address the resolution I purposed, a resolution that keeps the mortgage current and pays back 100 % of the disputed credit line component. Ive come to learn that the proposed solution is widely acceptable in these situations.

Wells Fargos only response to resolving the matter, almost immediately after the complaint, was to demand three monthly mortgage payments within a five week period ( due by the day after XXXX ) to avoid foreclosure. Despite great hardship, I made these payment by XX/XX/2019, making the mortgage current up to XXXX. 

At this point, I appeal to the CFPB and seek assistance resolving this matter. I believe Wells Fargo did manipulate the process with the intent of circumventing regulatory protections to enrich themselves at my expense and to the detriment of my credit rating. 

The initial resolution I proposed was as follows : The bank would reset and recalculate the credit line they paired with the mortgage to reflect the same interest rate and amortization as the mortgage. I would ensure the mortgage is current and the credit line paid down to zero within five years. For the record, my current mortgage and credit line reflect loan to values ( LTV ) of 63 % and approximately 6 %, respectively, versus the banks appraisal of my home. I have grave concerns regarding the damage they did to my credit rating. 

Thank you in advance for your time, attention and help in this matter. Please feel free to call if I can be of assistance."

The credit card was closed and the full payment balance was paid and despite this Wells Fargo placed charges on the card that were not made by me and is now charging me late fees and interest on this fraudulent charge that THEY placed on my card that was closed months before."
3965,"Acccount Number XXXX, Wells Fargo. Master Card The issue is they stopped sending paper statements and I was not aware of this situation. Statements Stopped after XX/XX/XXXX. I have asked Wells Fargo to remove late fees and report to Credit Agencies as this was their mistake. They do no seem to be taking responsibility for this mistake. I am asking for a XXXX credit for these late fees and removal of any negative reporting to the agencies. Wells Fargo case # is XXXX"
3966,I was enrolled in a reward incentive program when the card was open in XX/XX/2021. The cost was a {$XXXX}. That states if you have no scratches or repairs made on your furniture the first year. You will receive your {$XXXX} back. I have not received my money back.
3969,I filed a fraud claim with Well Fargo credit card for 2 fraudulent purchases made on XX/XX/2022 for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$420.00} and XXXX ) XXXX {$280.00}. I nor anyone in my household or anyone known to me made these charges. Wells Fargo reversed the fraud claim. I sent Wells Fargo letter on XX/XX/2022 stating I did not make the charges nor did anyone else known to me make the charges.
3970,"Wells Fargo ( the creditor ) failed to mail me billing statements. Because of this I notified them every month in writing and by phone that I had not received any of my billing statements. The creditor stated that they would be sending out the statements in the mail and that their system keeps having issues with not sending the billing statements. The creditor never sent me billing statements. Because of this I was unaware if I had a balance on my account. I was also unaware if I had a minimum payment due. I did not make any payments as I did not receive instructions on how to pay my bill. The creditor reported my account as late ( delinquent ) to all 3 major credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ). After a couple of months/years, the creditor finally sent me a collections notice requesting immediate payment of a specific dollar amount without explaining what the amount was for. Because I did not want negative information on my credit report, I paid the amount that was requested of me. The creditor reported my account as charged off. The creditor violated several consumer protection laws by not reporting my account as current ( never late ) and closed. The creditor does not have tracking information showing that I received the billing statements they were required to send me."
3973,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I closed all my accounts with Wells Fargo which includes a checking account, Savings account. I also had one no fee credit card for a safety measure but rarely used, which was closed in XX/XX/XXXX. My last statement for this credit card was due XX/XX/XXXX and I have not received any communication about this card since then. I also have not been able to log into any Wells Fargo online banking account since XX/XX/XXXX. 

This past month I was issued a new credit card by Wells Fargo with a different credit card number claiming this card has been open since XXXX, which is the time the first Credit Card was opened."
3974,"I went to Wells Fargo, on XX/XX/XXXX, to submit an application for a business credit card for my real estate business. I received a call from banker, Ms. XXXX XXXX, notifying me that I have been declined because I am "" soliciting too much credit ''. I spoke with the manager, Ms. XXXX XXXX, to explain I have my credit report and it shows two recent inquiries including Wells Fargo so how could I have been declined? She assumed the underwriters may decline someone for 3 or more recent inquiries and she will reach out to them to see what could be done and call me back.

After waiting for a month I decided to return to the bank on XX/XX/XXXX with the two credit reports used by the underwriters in hand and spoke to Ms. XXXX in person. She was able to see my XXXX  credit score was XXXX at the time of submission and that I had 4 hard inquiries within the last 2 years, two of those inquiries were on the same day, XX/XX/XXXX, for the same type of business and one other mortgage inquiry over a year ago in XXXX. Ms. XXXX was unsure why my business was declined and stated only the underwriter knows. I made clear that I am being discriminated against and the reason given does not match the actual facts on my credit report. Ms. XXXX stated she will see if I can file a complaint but I don't expect to hear from them per usual."
3977,On XX/XX/18 Wells Fargo charged me {$25.00} for an annual fee for their secured credit card. I have really good credit and have been denied the opportunity to receive an unsecured credit card. Wellsfargo takes advantage of this and charges me a {$25.00} fee every year. I have been a customer for more than 3 years.
3984,"On XX/XX/2021 I received an email notice from Wells Fargo that my Wells Fargo XXXX Visa card was used for an online, phone or mail purchase. I knew that I did not make or authorize the purchase so I called the number on my credit card to cancel the card since I don't use this card regularly. I first learned that no charge had been made to the account, the charge was declined but the email notice did not indicate that it was declined. It stated that the card was used, which to me meant the charge had been successful. When I called to cancel the card, the representative told me that if I cancelled the card now, I would lose the {$36.00} in rewards that remained in the account, so I should call the redemption center to redeem the rewards before I close the account. 

I then called the redemption center and was told that I could only redeem awards in {$25.00} increments. Which would mean that I would forfeit {$11.00} that I had earned by spending money using the credit card. I have a Wells Fargo mortgage and asked if I could apply the excess {$11.00} to my mortgage, or even to the credit card balance. They said this was not their policy, despite the fact that there had been attempts to use the credit card number without authorization. I asked if I could escalate this to a manager. The representative opened a case number and said they would get back to me in a few days. At this time I was still receiving daily email messages about the same transaction attempting to use my credit card. 

It took until XX/XX/XXXX, almost XXXX weeks later for me to receive a written response to my case number XXXX. The response completely failed to address my issue. I have no visibility into how my issue was presented, but based on the response it appears that the analyst, XXXX XXXX was told that I had a dispute about my reward amount. Therefore the response stated that I "" have a {$35.00} redeemable Cash Rewards balance. '' On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX to explain that she had not addressed by compliant. I had to leave a message since she did not answer. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called again and spoke to a different representative who said that she would inform XXXX XXXX about the specific details of my complaint. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX a Case Specialist at Wells Fargo under a new case number XXXX. Again, the letter failed to address my issue with closing my account and redeeming my full {$35.00} rewards balance. It confirmed that the balance is correct and referred me to the number to redeem Rewards. Again the response failed to address the issue of the redemption requirement in {$25.00} increments. I'm not surprised that Wells Fargo keeps this unethical restriction a secret. They don't want to print it anywhere where a customer would actually be aware of the restriction. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to call XXXX XXXX to discuss this case. I was unable to reach her and ended up speaking to someone named XXXX who submitted another case for resolution now under number XXXX. Another week later, I have not received any reply from my third case number. My credit card remains open until I can resolve the cash back rewards issue. I would like to close this card and redeem my full rewards balance. I am not interested in receiving a replacement card from Wells Fargo"
3989,"I have been requesting a check for the negative account balance of my {$3400.00}. Wells Fargo has been telling me they would send the check within a maximum of 30 days, for my account which has a negative balance. I made the request for the check on XX/XX/2021. Customer service has lied multiple times and said the check would be sent within 30 days and it has still not been sent."
3991,"I have an excellent XXXX score - XXXX as reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Downloaded credit report from XXXX does not match with the refusal reasons provided by Wells Fargo. 

* Serious Delinquency >> No such information on a credit report by XXXX * Lack of recent installment loan. 
>> I do not have a need for a loan and this is not a loan application * Too little time has passed since bank cards were opened.

>> I have 2 cards, one was opened in XX/XX/XXXX and the other in XX/XX/XXXX. 
* Account has late payments or negative records within 1year of  opening. 
>> I always pay in full and no such late payment info in my record. 

Since each card refusal ( hard credit check ) has a negative impact on my credit history, I want a detail review and explanation on the refusal. The refusal summary and credit report DO NOT MATCH."
3992,"To Whom It May Concern : I am writing to express my concern about the continuation of shady business practices being committed by Wells Fargo. I have two credit cards with Wells Fargo, a primary card ( a XXXX XXXX card ending in XXXX ), and a secondary card ( a  Platinum card ending in XXXX ). I never use the secondary credit card as the rewards are not as good as the primary card. 

Around XXXX of 2018 I had requested a replacement of the secondary card because I had misplaced it somewhere it in my house. The card being replaced ended in XXXX. The replacement card arrived XXXX now ending in XXXX ), and I activated over the phone as I have dozens of times in the past. The account had disappeared from my Wells Fargo app when this happened. I thought nothing of it as there is usually some changes there when I activate a new card, and since I never use the secondary card I didn't give it a second thought. 

On XX/XX/2018, I received an email confirming the delivery preferences for the account ( attachment 1 ). As you can see in the screenshot, I was had chosen to receive notices by mail and online. I believe this was the date I activated the card but I am not sure as I don't keep track of dates like that.

As you can see in attachment 2, I was receiving emails regarding payments being due for the original secondary card ( XXXX ) through XX/XX/2018. I have also been receiving emails for my primary card ( XXXX ) the entire time. The secondary card emails stopped after the delivery preferences email on XX/XX/2018. I did not notice this as I was not using the secondary card. 

I continued to use the primary card while my secondary card remained at home. On XX/XX/2018 I noticed a Wells Fargo envelop in my mail. Wells Fargo constantly sends me junk mail about taking out loans with them, so I figured this was another piece of junk mail. I opened it and much to my dismay it stated I was past due on my account. 

I was horrified : I've never been late on a credit card payment. In fact, I typically pay off my cards a few times per month. I've attached the payments for my primary card in attachment 3. As you can see, I am constantly paying off the balance on the card, usually twice a month. 

I quickly opened the Wells Fargo app on my phone and looked for the account so I could make a payment. It wasn't there. The secondary card was not on the app or online. Confused, I called into Wells Fargo support. I asked how could I know that I was past due when the card was not showing up on the app. The representative informed me I had not opted in on something relating to online banking for the card. With the dozens of cards I've activated from Wells Fargo I've never had to do anything to get it to appear in my account. 

The representative was understanding and I made the payment for {$38.00} over the phone as seen in attachment 4. After the call I logged into XXXX XXXX and my horror continued as I saw my credit score had dropped over 100 points to around XXXX. 

This was terrible news, I am hoping to buy my first house eventually and my excellent credit was the biggest asset I had. Saddened, I called back into Wells Fargo and explained my situation. I went over how : - I've never missed a payment with them - I was unaware that I was past due on the card - The card was not on my Wells Fargo app - I had not received any notices - I was paying off my primary card the entire time. 
I explained how I had no problems paying the late fees. The balance must have transferred over form the old card as I had never used that card to make a purchase ( I still haven't to this day as you can see in attachment 4 ). The representative submitted the inquiry and told me from there I'd have to wait to see what happened. 

I continued to check XXXX XXXX daily for updates. I was ecstatic when my score returned to ( almost ) where it was before this entire situation on XX/XX/XXXX. 

However, around that same time I received a letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX, from Wells Fargo. It stated they had looked into my inquiry and, after researching my account, found that the information was accurate. I was floored, I had not once disputed that I was late. Wells Fargo thinking that was what the dispute was over shows a huge disconnect and makes indicates they didn't actually investigate anything. 

I continued to monitor my credit score in XXXX. It had refreshed 3 times in XXXX without change ( it actually increased 1 point mid-XXXX ). I had thought this nightmare was over and that I could work hard to gain back the 10 or points I was down from before. 

Much to my dismay, I received an alert from XXXX XXXX yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, stating I had a credit drop. My score dropped 40 points. 

Now I am writing into the CFPB hoping that you can help. 

This whole time I have been wondering : why did an active credit card account not show up on the Wells Fargo app or online? I think it is pretty clear why : Wells Fargo was opening fraudulent accounts for millions of Americans and they needed a way to hide it from these customers. Why else would an active account be hidden, and why else would they even need that functionality? I'm know you filks at the CFPB are well aware of this huge scandal as you have fined Wells Fargo $ XXXX. 

I am in no way stating they opened this account without my knowledge of course. But I do think I was negatively affected due to their ability to still hide active accounts from customers years after this scandal was first discovered. 

I had no reason to not pay the balance of the secondary card : it was less than {$40.00} and as you can see in attachment 3, I was paying off the other card for amounts 6 to 22 times more than the {$40.00}. As soon as I received the past due notice I paid immediately. 

Thank you for taking the time to read through this lengthy message. Please feel free to contact me if any additional info or clarification is needed. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"

XXXX I called in to Wells Fargo and was told the fraud charges were not marked. This after being told on the phone and in person that the charges were marked as fraud and would be refunded. I summarily closed the credit card account and paid the balance. 

I am unable to get an answer from Wells Fargo as to whether the charges will be refunded now since the card has been closed and I no longer have a Wells Fargo account. I find this unacceptable ; Wells Fargo has said it will take an additional 10 days to process, despite the mistake not being my own. Additionally, they are unable to guarantee that the fraudulent funds will be returned to me after my conversations ; only that they will process the return into an account that is no longer active."

4024,"I was a victim of identity theft in XX/XX/2014. Wells Fargo sent me a letter saying that they stopped the transactions on my Wells Fargo Credit Card and credited my account. Well, I had it set up where my credit card would automatically draft from my checking account and pay the balance in full when the bill was due, so it took {$920.00} from my checking account. I called multiple times to get this issue resolved and even had a personal banker work on my case, but Wells Fargo customer service kept transferring us around and never letting this issue go any furthur to being solved. It has been 5 years and they still have not solved this issue and it has been written as a charge off on my credit report and still reporting to this day."

4026,"I had a credit card with WF up until it was suddenly Closed. In XXXX. I have no late payments, no outstanding payments and did not go over any limits during my time of having a credit card with WF. I spent over four hour being transferred on the phone from online banking, the credit card department, the claims department to line of credit department. I have good to great credit from every agency, but can not get a credit card, because of something WF did. I can not find any delinquencies and wrongdoing on my end. Every time I call the credit card, WF departments, they tell me, "" we will send you a explanation in the mail ''. I have requested explanation verbal, written and electronic for almost five years now, with no explanation. I have been making payments with the same amounts due for four years. I currently own {$5600.00} and have been making on time payments since the closure. That amount is not even close to the amount I had as my limit, so therefore my card should have never been closed. The limit was {$15000.00}. 
One month the interest rate is {$54.00}, then {$59.00}, then {$57.00}. I am being charged nearly half percentage every month of what is owed. 

The actions I have taken are contacting WF initially for four hours trying to get something resolved. I have spoken with every department they transferred me to, via phone. I have gone into the banks for explanations with no answers, but that I can not either open my account or even a new one without explanation. I have reviewed my credit card scores from multiple agencies in which there are no red flags. I've spoke with WF "" claims and disputes '' and they have stated that it was closed due to "" red flags ''. Years later I have attempted to open up another credit card and they stated I could not and to contact WF on the reasoning why."
4027,"Through XXXX XXXX product referral, I applied for a Wells Fargo Platinum CC with a 0 % intro rate for 18 months, and an interest rate of 13-27 % at the end of the term based on credit score and income. My credit scores were XXXX through XXXX, XXXX from XXXX, and XXXX from XXXX. WF issues the card with a credit limit of {$1500.00} with 0 % APR through XX/XX/20 and 27 % thereafter. My income annual exceeds the income of 99 % of US households and I have 98 % of available credit across 15 active accounts available. No one at Wells Fargo could explain what the APR would be at the same income and available % of credit with FICO scores differing between 850, 800, 750, 700, 650, etc. I believe that WF falsely advertised the lower 13 % interest rate as a means to trick consumers with good credit history to apply for a credit card that would always be a high interest credit card. Further, I do not believe Wells Fargo is using actuarial or any valid means of issuing credit to risk. I reported the issue to XXXX and XXXX XXXX as well as Wells Fargo. I closed the account with Wells Fargo without ever using it. However, they will be reported as a lender in my report as well as a hard inquiry, adversely impacting my FICO score."
4030,"I wanted to switch to a different card ( to Visa Cash Wise from Visa Signature ) offered by Wells Fargo in XX/XX/2017.

I would rather have the credit limit on the older card reduced ( e.g. {$1000.00} ) and transfered that credit limit to the Visa Cash Wise. 

I have called Wells Fargo, but they are not willing to accomodate that request. I don't really understand why, as there would be no change to my overall credit line"

My balance was now {$110.00}. My payment was still in processing status on their side and not completed. This was my first billing cycle with them so I wanted to make sure everything was alright and was why I logged in the day after my payment was due to make sure everything processed okay. Their customer service agent named XXXX told me that eventually the late fee would be removed, but the interest charges would remain. I informed her that was illegal because I scheduled the payment on XX/XX/XXXX for the due date of XX/XX/XXXX on their web site and I paid on time. It was their processing time that was late.

3. The automated system instead transferred me back to the beginning of the automated system.

4. I then pressed XXXX several times for an agent. 

5. The agent in credit card customer service said she would have to transfer me to another department.

6. Instead, she transferred me back to the beginning to the automated system.

7. I pressed XXXX again several times for an agent. Spoke with agent, asked for supervisor. 

8. Supervisor, XXXX, said she needed to get me to other department; said she would stay on line this time until I was with correct department, even just to answer a simple yes or no question regarding whether my payment was pending. She transferred me to "" XXXX XXXX. '' 9. XXXX XXXX pulled up my acct. and said she needed to get me to "" another department '', YET A THIRD DEPARTMENT. She said she was in the "" Front End '' Department ( probably not even the department to which I was supposed to be transferred in the first place, which means that even XXXX the supervisor who stayed on the line for the transfer, failed to help me ). I asked XXXX XXXX for her supervisor. She instead hung up the phone on me. 

10. I called back YET AGAIN. Asked for Supervisor, XXXX XXXX. Asked XXXX XXXX for Tier Three, she placed me on hold and provided phone number for Executive Offices. XXXX transferred me to XXXX. 

11. I spoke with XXXX, XXXX Customer Advocacy Group / Executive Offices, who asked for my credit card #. I said I was afraid to provide the information because then I would just be transferred into an endless loop of being prompted to the beginning of the automated system. She hung up the phone on me without saying anything else. I continued talking without realizing she had hung up the phone.

12. I called back "" Executive Offices '' and got XXXX again, asked for her supervisor, she said I don't have anyone to transfer me to. 

13. XXXX admitted hanging up the phone on me without even saying anything, because she said I refused to provide information. I said if I provide the info, will you transfer me to the automated system? She said no, she would not. So, I provided the information and she was finally able to confirm the payment information. 

14. I then began relaying the whole story to XXXX. When I got to the part about her monstrous behavior of hanging up the phone on me the first time, she threatened to do it again. I began chanting "" Shame on You! '' She hung up the phone again. 

15. I called back and spoke with XXXX XXXX, Executive Offices. I provided XXXX with details regarding everything that's transpired.

so i called the fraud dept and was advised they wanted to make sure i applied for the account, okay wells fargo if it was fraud concerns why did you instant approved my application for credit? 

so the fraud lady said they needed to send a pass code to my phone to verify my identity so she confirmed that i did apply and my identity is verified. 

than she said which was over board on a retail credit card that she wanted me to fax over a 4506-c so she can review my total annuial income for severial years with the irs please note no other bank has ever asked for irs documents to verify my income this should have been asked before approval if it was income concern but at the beginning of the call it was just identity concern not income after they verified me now they want unnessary info after account opened and approved. 

i also feel i was discriminated against because some of my family and friends have a XXXX XXXX account and they told me they never was asked when there account was open to fax in an irs 4506-c so i dont understand why i was selected and refused to send extra even thou they verified me my credit is excellant it wasnt that issue because i was instant approved they verified me over the phone sending a one time phone number and now they want to go further in my income i called their fraud dept on XX/XX/2021 and requested to closed this retail account, and do not report this account to any credit bureaus do to the over reached in requesting proof of income from irs after approval which they could of just ask for a pay stub i not apply for a mortgage are personal loan this is a retail account this is not the way to treat a new customer for credit when they do not ask everyone who applys for this retail account proof of income with a 4506-c tax form to fill out.

i very dissapointed, that i was approved, recieved card, a week later retricted for fraud, than had fraud lifted and now they want 4506-c to keep the account open.

in my opinion do not open any retails accounts with wells fargo bank this how they treated me on an open account."

After several phone calls to their Credit Card Fraud Claims department ( I believe 5 phone calls so far ), Wells Fargo refuses to fulfill their responsibility and reimburse me for this transaction. After many phone calls, they finally sent me a one-page incomprehensible document ( attached here ) that they claim proves that I made the transaction and not someone else. It should be noted that they based their investigation based on this one page. 

At this point, I have no choice but to report Well Fargo to CFPB and hope you can resolve this issue. I have been a customer of Wells Fargo for over 8 years and had never claimed a fraudulent transaction until now. The one time that I fall victim to a financial fraud, they refuse to make me whole. 

I really hope you pursue this seriously. Given the history of this bank, I would not be surprised if many other customers are experiencing the same problem."
4044,"I applied for a Wells Fargo Secured Credit card back in XX/XX/XXXX. During this time, I paid off my credit cards on time, and without problems. I came into Financial Hardship when I was unexpectedly let go from my job as a customer service representative at an insurance firm in XX/XX/XXXX. I was unemployed for 9 months, and because of the fees attached that naturally carry a snowball effect, I had incurred charge offs/late payments on my account. I was unemployed with no source of income, no government assistance and almost becoming homeless on numerous occasions until XX/XX/XXXX. Beginning from my first paycheck at my new job, I began paying off the balance that was incurred and increasing every month from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, which went up to a total of {$560.00}. When I began paying my account, I was notified that they had already closed my account several months before in XX/XX/XXXX. They did not notify me of this information. I had communicated with the bank to try and negotiate some sort of pause on the account so I could pay off and maintain the account when I had access to funds via employment. Beginning in XX/XX/XXXX I began gradually paying off my debt of {$560.00} until the debt was completely paid off in XX/XX/XXXX. From XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. After trying to negotiate with Wells Fargo representatives to remove these late payment marks off of my account to no avail, I sent letters to all three of the main credit bureaus regarding this incident asking them to review my situation and to remove the late payment charge offs from this account. I sent all three bureaus letters in ( XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) demanding action to remove these late payments from my history be done. They did not take action, but only responded by stating they "" reviewed my request ''."

4051,"On my credit report I am getting penalized for deliquent credit card accounts. These two accounts were my ex-wife 's, which she had prior to our relationship. She made me an authorized user on both of the accounts during the relationship. Now, being divorced for almost 2 years, my credit report still shows association with her credit cards. The credit card companies can not access these accounts without her authorization or passwords, which I have zero access to which leaves me with my hands tied behind my back and at fault for her debt. I am unsure of the exact amount she owes or how long these accounts have been deliquent. I don't even know her account number or credit card numbers."
4052,"This is a follow-up to CFPB case number XXXX, Wells Fargo case number XXXX. I was told by Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2018 that my next statement would contain the correct promotional terms ; however, my XX/XX/2018 statement still contains the incorrect promotional terms."
4056,"I have a VISA CREDIT CARD with Wells Fargo. I noticed in XX/XX/XXXX I was being charged Interest on Cash Advance. I emailed Wells Fargo about this. I informed them that I have never done a cash advance or do I have a pin number for that card. This card has never been in a ATM. Wells Fargo stated that the cash advanced fees were on purchases. When I went on line to print my transactions for XX/XX/XXXX I could only find two ( 2 ) all other information is gone. 

XX/XX/XXXX amount {$23.00} Interest on Cash Advance XX/XX/XXXX amount {$24.00} Interest on Cash Advance XX/XX/XXXX amount {$24.00} Interest on Cash Advance"
4058,"I went to use my credit card to buy something and it would not work, so I logged into my Wells Fargo app and it said card has been reported as lost or stolen. This felt super alarming and violating as I had the card in my hand and I didnt report it as lost or stolen. Did someone get my SSN? I called right away to find out more information. 

I called Wells Fargo and I waited on hold for 45 minutes to be told they dont know anything someone called to cancel it and that the account is officially closed and if I want more credit I will need to apply again. They also said I needed to go into a bank to get more information. Feeling extremely XXXX off by their lack of information, I rushed to the nearest bank for answers. 

Keep in mind, at this point Im super upset as Im in the middle of moving and just paid off most of that card to free up room to purchase furniture for my new place. I also dont know if I want to do business with Wells Fargo or open a new card with them as this feels like they are the ones that messed up and I dont trust them. I have enough on my plate with the move, and now this. Will it affect my credit? Will I even be able to get another card? 

I arrive at the bank, and I wait 10 minutes to talk to a banker who starts making calls on my behalf. After 45 minutes of being transferred to multiple different people, someone on the phone asks for me to be conferenced in. The banker and person on the phone call my cell to conference me in, and the mumbling man on the line says something about me violating the terms and conditions, that the bank shut down my account, and gives me a complaint # as well as instructions of what will happen next. So basically, Wells Fargo lied to me about my card being reported as lost or stolen. The bank ( hopefully robots? ) closed my card without my consent or knowledge for violating terms and conditions. Is using a credit card and paying it off violating terms and conditions? I dont think so. I read the terms and conditions and I couldnt find how I could have possibly violated it. Sounds like Wells Fargo messed up and cant take accountability for it. 

Jump to now, Im totally screwed for setting my space up. I will have to dig into all of my savings to furnish my home, which will make me feel very unstable. I have tried to apply for another card, outside of Wells Fargo and I have been denied ( perhaps because I got a line of credit with XXXX XXXX the day before. ) but after being denied, I will definitely not apply for another card this year as I know it looks bad for creditors. 

They barely sent me an email today ( 2 business days after the incident ) explaining they need 10 days to respond and at that they might need more time. This all feels very shady. I will be switching banks ASAP."
4059,"Good afternoon, I applied for and received a Wells Fargo Cash Wise credit card. The card offer stated that I would receive 0 % interest for 12 months. However, I have only had the card a few months and they have charged me interest for the past two months. I contacted Wells Fargo and they credited me back the 2 months interest, but they did not change my interest rate back to 0 % In addition, I was supposed to receive a {$200.00} cash bonus after making {$1000.00} in purchases, which I have done. However, I have not received the {$200.00} bonus. I have inquired about this two times, but I have not received the {$200.00} bonus. 

Attached is the offer that I responded to."

But then on XXXX  and XXXX, they are reporting me 30 days late inXX/XX/XXXX 60 days late in XX/XX/2018 and 90 days late in XX/XX/2018. 

XXXX even shows 30 days late in XX/XX/2018. 

But if you look at the screenshot of my credit report, they all say dispute resolved, customer disagrees but they didn't change anything.

4070,I called my bank to file a claim on some fraudulent charges on my business account. They closed my debit card and sent me a new one. My merchant sends deposits through my debit card and my deposits are missing from theXX/XX/XXXX when I received and activated my new card. My merchant says they have traced the money back to Wells Fargo and they have definitive proof Wells Fargo has not sent back my deposit and has my money. I have spent over 12 collective hours on the phone and been to the bank at least 4 times. Wells Fargo claims they do not have my money. Somehow {$1000.00} worth of deposits is just missing? My merchant is XXXX. I have been with both companies 7 years.

Initially I thought it was my children using my card with my permission to purchase games with XXXX XXXX I noticed a {$53.00} debited and I didn't authorize that neither did my children purchase anything. 
I called wellsfargo immediately and they shut down the card and not too long I saw they credited my account from XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX to Approximately XXXX plus. 
Then with new card they sent which I never activated, I saw a debit for {$8.00} for XXXX whilst I activated the card on XXXX. 
I called the back XX/XX/XXXX and complained how was that possible and I was told by XXXX that XXXX has the digital number and they approved it and I asked how was that possible that I thought once a card has been termed fraudulent by the bank everything is deactivated and she said she can only explain in general terms for me and that by the way ; the provisional approvals on the past claims for the same issues that I made was declined and they removed the credits that was issued before. I was shocked and said I was never notified on anything. She said it will come in 9 to 10 business days. She transferred me to a fraud specialist and I explained what XXXX told me and the specialist XXXX said that XXXX has the jurisdiction WITH VISA TO BYPASS ANY HOLD AS LONG AS THEY TELL THE COMPANY THAT THIS IS THEIR REGULAR CLIENT AND THE COMPANY VISA WILL APPROVE. which was why I was still charged despite it was not active. I asked the agent that I thought once your card is changed that it Is the customer that notifies and updates her new card number. Herself. That this is another new information I was so frustrated that when she said she was shutting down my card again i asked her why because if XXXX can bypass the blockage the charges are forever going to be occurring and she said I should call XXXX and cancel the subscription. I have been calling XXXX and the last person asked me what subscription and I said I did not know. She transferred me to a department that ought to help and i was waiting for 1.30mins and none came on. I had to end the call.

4080,"I was scammed by a company in the XXXX about XX/XX/XXXX. I did not know this, at the time. They were very professional and promised that I could get my money at any time. They showed this by doing a transaction which was profitable and then sent me the money to my account with Wells Fargo Bank. They wanted me to invest more and do it again. There was no warning from the bank of the other people getting scammed by this Company and industry. I sent the money through my credit card so I would have the protection of Visa guidelines which states if product or services are not delivered, I would be entitled to get a chargeback. This rule applies to ALL COUNTRIES and I sent this to Well Fargo. To make a very long story short. Wells Fargo got me my money back. But after a few months, they said they had to send the money back because if the case went to arbitration and we lost it could cost the bank a lot of money. They also said the Visa rule didn't apply to the XXXX but they wouldn't show me where this was written. They sent the money back to them. They also said they knew they were crooks but they said they had to do it. I sent them an e-mail saying "" If you send the money back to them, it's your money you are sending them. '' I also included that I didn't receive the product, A state of the art trading platform that didn't even show the current trading candle, A 24 / 7 Account Manager and they didn't follow my trading instructions. I made over 5300 trades and they made 35 where was the Account Manager? And they didn't close my account. 

The Truth In Lending Act is the federal law that gives consumers the legal right to dispute credit card charges if there is a billing error, which includes when property or services are not delivered to the consumer as agreed. Wells Fargo said the crooks accomplished this by just accepting the money. I BEG TO DIFFER!!!! 

On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX wrote : It has become a trust issue, I feel that you do not have my back. I text a problem with fills and not even a word. I now need to see all of my options. So until then please don't trade for me. I have been asking for you guys to trade for me for this for the life of my account until now. After the past few days I need to see if I can trust you again. Tell me how to build the trust back! 


XXXX XXXX On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX wrote : XXXX is the only one I trust. Will you make it where he gets the commission on this account? And can I get the final turnover number that I need to reach, and where I am sitting now the last amount is incorrect. Then I would like the updated total at weeks end. If you will do this I will agree to let XXXX trade for me, with no more than a 2 % ( of the account ) per trade. 

XXXX XXXX They traded three trades of {$10000.00}. and three more trades over {$5000.00} in five minutes They needed my permission to trade on the account. I gave permission to trade on my account with the above stipulation. No more than 2 % per trade. 

They also didnt close my account. XXXX XXXX called me on the phone trying to close my account. He wanted to send me approximately {$970.00} and close the account. Please notice that this goes against there bonus policy. I refused because it would take away my argument of no platform/business. I would be entitled to my chargeback. Wells Fargo refused to argue this as well. 
XXXX XXXX took my {$48000.00}. To {$970.00} against my stipulations. I did not authorize these trades."

4084,declined transtions and allways have to have card replaced it takes and lot of time and payment are not made because you have to notify company of changes.
4088,On XX/XX/2020 my bill did not go through account with missed payment. I am kindly requesting WELLS FARGO BANK CAR to remove this missed payment from my credit reports as a gesture of goodwill. Doing so would sincerely be appreciated and represent an invaluable gift to my family and me.
4091,"I was notified by Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2022 that a payment of {$41.00} was due from a balance of {$1700.00}. When I called to speak with the fraud department they told me that XXXX cash advances were sent to my checking account with Wells Fargo. This was another issue of fraud as I have never opened any checking accounts with Wells Fargo, I use a different bank for my checking and savings account. Both these cash advances were on a credit card that had yet to be activated. They then had to close the false checking account that was opened without my permission before moving on to the actual fraud that I originally called about. Once that was done they told me that the cash advances were done over the phone to the false checking account that was opened. The representative then had to activate the card before looking into the account where they told me that XXXX cash advances had been taken from the account, XXXX cash advance was for {$1000.00} and another for {$600.00}. A fraud claim was submitted and on XX/XX/2022 they sent a letter stating that "" they couldn't reverse the online transfers because there was not enough funds in the account or the account has been closed. We were unable to reverse any related fees and adjusted interest. Your claim is now closed. '' My account now clearly shows that adjustments were made and with dates that are incorrect. Looking at my account the first transaction shows a interest charge of {$23.00} on a cash advance on XX/XX/2022. It then shows the cash advance of {$1700.00} on XX/XX/2022 and a phone payment of the same amount on the same day. What then follows is all the interest and late fees that have occurred since then in my account. This has now affected my credit score due to the lack of action on their part."
4093,"Around the beginning of XX/XX/2019 WellsFargo was sending me emails regarding a balance transfer offer. So I logged in and in order to read all of the pertinent information, I had to opt in two or three different companies to be able to contact me at any time. If I did not want to do this on the computer that way, at the bottom was a number to call and do it over the phone. I was not clear about a 2.9 % charge, so I called to make sure I had a better understanding. I called the first time and spoke with customer service to explain the charge. I was told 0 % for 12 Months and a 2.9 % charge for any additional purchases made on the account. I said ok thank you. I called the second time and asked the same question and was told 0 % for 12 Months and a 2.9 % charge for any additional purchases made on the card. I did the balance transfer on XX/XX/2019 and it posted on XX/XX/2019 in the amount of {$3700.00}. It was a 4 % Balance Transfer Fee of 4 % which in total is {$150.00}. On XX/XX/2019 I made a small payment of {$33.00} and my balance was {$3800.00}. On XX/XX/2019 around XXXX I noticed my balance changed to {$3900.00}. I checked online and it stated, "" Interest Charge on Purchases {$3.00}. '' I didn't make any purchases, So I immediately called WellsFargo to see what happened and was told because I did the balance transfer in the middle of the month. I stated, "" What difference does it make if the promotion was over XX/XX/2019. '' He kept putting me on hold and could not give me an answer. he put in a complaint and gave me a complaint number and stated that a Case Manager of some sort would call me back in a day. A day went by no call so I called them. Let 's just say I called six different times, I have two complaints filed with numbers. The people I was transferred to where very rude and not knowledgeable about anything that I was asking. According to WellsFargo all the calls are recorded. So the last person I spoke with by the name of XXXX stated that the Case Managers were out. I said well when will I receive a phone call back and he stated, I don't know their schedules and being very rude. He also stated the case manager was out sick and my case was assigned that day. So on my part the calls started on XX/XX/2019. After going back and forth and nobody has called me back regarding my issue six different times and it is XX/XX/2019. WellsFargo in my opinion is practicing unethical business practices and I will not forget what happened last year with them stealing customers information and making accounts without their knowledge to get bonuses. They are misleading in their promotions with unethical, deceptive practices. I deserve answers!!!! All the calls are recorded, so Pull the calls WellsFargo and hear the proof of your unprofessional staff, customer service, me the customer asking to explain the 2.9 % charge and both customer service representatives stating 0 $ for 12 months and 2.9 % for any additional purchases. Also, I asked every call how the 2.9 % would be charged ; daily, monthly, annually and no answers. No managers are ever around, case managers are always out and nobody has called me back to rectify this situation. Pull the Call WellsFargo, all six of them."

I submitted a cancellation policy and was told they are working on a refund, 3 months later no refund and no more responses. I then filed a dispute with Wells Fargo on my XXXX XXXX. At first, they did not look into the issue. I had to call over 30 days later because I kept receiving automated emails that we are working on your request. When I called they were thankful because I supplied details ( as mentioned, raining, no sunshine and nobody could use the pool ). Wells Fargo took over 3 months to respond and told me that it is the merchant cancellation policy although it is a XXXX. I've never been treated like this with any purchase, especially one I cancelled and showed the thread of responses to say cancel, we can't use the pool today."
4100,"Initiated the application process for a Wells Fargo credit card but did not complete the application process. I did not agree to the terms and conditions which were presented during the application process. When presented with the terms and conditions agreement page I closed out of the application.

Even though I did not agree or authorize an account to be created in my name I received a credit card approximately two weeks after initiating the application process. A balance transfer was made to another credit account which had a zero balance. This resulted in a balance transfer fee of {$270.00}. The initial balance of {$9000.00} was refunded to Wells Fargo.

4103,I applied and got approved for a Wells Fargo Business Platinum credit card that comes with 1 % cashback on purchases. I have not received any of the cashback rewards despite having made over {$2500.00} in purchases on this credit card. I called to fix this issue and never got a call back.
4104,"I have been charged a late fee in XX/XX/2019 by Wells Fargo because my payment was cleared before their billing cycle ended. As a result, they took the payment and applied it to the balance and did not count it towards my payment that was due on the XXXX of XXXX. Their representative stated this is clearly outlined on my statement when in fact there is nothing. According to her, my payment needs to be made after the close of the billing cycle in order for it to be applied to the current statement balance. 
In other words, if I make a payment on the first of the month, and before the XXXX of the month, Wells Fargo applies this as an additional principle payment and ignores the current amount due. They then charge me a late fee of {$38.00} and add {$1.00} of interest to the next payment. 
I received no notification that I had a late payment or an explanation as to why my payment was not applied to my account other than it was outside their billing cycles."
4117,"Today, on XX/XX/XXXX I accessed my online account to pay my credit card balance and I noticed a recent charge, which stood out to me since I haven't utilized the card for weeks while self-quarantining for Covid-19. It was a "" Rewards Annual Membership Fee. '' I didn't recognize this charge so I tried to access the information about where it came from, but no details were provided on the link -- which is not typical. Most vendors provide a phone number at the very minimum. Suspecting fraud I called card services right away. When I asked the representative to find me a contact number for that entity he laughed and said that it was Wells Fargo. This was the first time I heard of any Rewards associated with this credit card. This representative told me that he had to 'erase ' all of the points that he said I had earned ( apparently 13K+ ), stating that it was the only way that he could proceed in resolving this dispute as he couldn't get past that window without me agreeing to let him delete the points. I told him that I was fine with that so long as all charges, current and past, were credited back to me. I then asked him to go back and see how many times over the past several years I had been charged. After waiting on hold he returned to the line and said that there had been no previous charges. By this point I had started going through my tax files and found statements from XXXX and XXXX, each showing a {$50.00} awards membership charge. He then transferred me to someone in "" customer care. '' This person started the conversation by saying that I had accessed my rewards. I informed her that this was definitely not the case as I had no knowledge of said rewards until today and that the only person who accessed them was the representative I had first spoken to who deleted all of the points. 

I spent an hour and a half trying to get this issue resolved. At the time that I opened this account there was no mention of any rewards program or any annual fee associated with this account. It may have been hidden somewhere in the fine print, but I guarantee you that as part of the conversation with the banker I would have insisted on reassurance that there were no annual fees associated with the card. This credit card was going to be dedicated to a small business with low volume purchases ( low reward opportunity ) and I would NEVER have agreed to pay an annual fee -- nor would I have failed to ask if there was an annual fee for the card. I have great credit and I can obtain a credit card from any company that I want -- I would NOT have agreed to a fee. I'm submitting this complaint because it seems reasonable to assume that I'm not the only person who has experienced this problem. All in all it appears that at the very minimum they've fraudulently charged my account {$200.00}. I am insisting on FULL reimbursement for every charge, seeing as I've never accessed said rewards and had no knowledge until today of said rewards. I'm told that my case ( # XXXX ) has been moved up to "" Case Management '' at Wells Fargo. They gave me a direct access number of XXXX. Though I have been verbally assured that the most recent charge of {$50.00} has been removed, there is not evidence of this credit on my online account as of yet."
4123,"On Saturday morning ( XX/XX/2020 ) i recieved a text notice of suspicious activity on my Wells Fargo debit card. 
Someone had withdrawn XXXX $ from a XXXX located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, FL XXXX. 
I called them and notified them that i did not make that purchase and and they said someone must have used a skimmer to steal my information and create a fake card and use it to steal the money and they would take care of it. 
Then earlier today Wednsday XX/XX/2020 instead of rejecting the transaction they approved it and also added a XXXX $ fee for using an out of network atm on top of it. 
I called to ask why and they said they had denied my claim and there was nothing they could do about it and that since a chip was used i must have done it myself and must be lying about it. 
I don't think they put any amount of effort into investigating my claim i think they could care less about their customers. 
I am filing a police report with the XXXX County Sheriff 's Office. 
Any assistance you could give me would be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you."
4126,"On XX/XX/18 I was looking for new auto and renters insurance online. I found auto insurance for {$800.00} on XXXX  online. I purchased it but when the purchase went through it was {$1200.00}. I called them right away ( in less than 5 minutes ) and cancelled the insurance. I also told them that it was a horrible way to treat the public. The renters insurance was going to be in a bundle, but the insurance never went through and till this day I am getting emails to finish my purchase. The insurance agent could not even find it in the system. I told XXXX to make sure my card wont be charged. XXXX said they wont charge my card. 
XXXX charged my card the same day for {$360.00} for auto and {$44.00} for renters insurance. XXXX  does not refund my card and Wells Fargo allows XXXX to charge my credit card without my permission. I talked to Wells Fargo 3 times and exchanged emails with them. They said that it takes time to revise the charges. It has been over 1 MONTH ago, and the charges are still on my card and now Wells Fargo wants payments. 
The XXXX XXXX fine Wells Fargo got a month ago was not enough for the bank because they still defraud customers! I called Wells Fargo the same day and explained them what happened. They still let the charge to go through."
4132,Wells Fargo dispute resolution would not issue a chargeback involving merchant XXXX XXXX ' XXXX  which admitted to fraud. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX knowingly over-charged {$29.00} and Wells Fargo 's response is that merchants can run their businesses however they want.
4133,In XX/XX/XXXX of 2019 The Bank put a decline on my account. This was an late payment issue and the bank recognized this on their end because they closed the account then kept it closed when I disputed the issue with a clerk over the phone. They sent me a letter saying their willing to reopen the account but it never removed inquiry revolving in the same issue. It just popped up in the two other bureaus and has greatly lowered my score.
4135,"I got a temporary card from Wells Fargo and whitin a week someone made fraudulent charges for the amount of XXXX XXXX.Wells Fargo called me suspecting a fraud and I did not recognize the charges so they gave me a temporary refund.After 10 days they decided the charges were legitimate because I did not have a story with the card, it was new I never used an it was in my wallet.The only charges were the fraudulent ones I presume the card was compromised in the Bank before they gave it to me as they were able to access my account.change the PIN and the daily amount to withdraw. 
The Bank did not observe any of the measures of the security protocol before allowing the changes and the fraudulent charges. 
The Bank has not offered more information and the case manager is not answering my calls, nevertheless they escalated the case and I am still pending to get my money back.I am a senior citizen and want to be treated fairly. 
I am in panic that they will do it again and I have lost confidence in the Bank and its systems. 
Thanks for your guidance.My case # XXXX"
4136,"I had opened my credit card in XXXX of XXXX. It was a personal credit card, not a business credit card. The name of the credit card is know as XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo Bank closed out my credit card account on XX/XX/XXXX. My credit card was never paid late, not even once. I also never went over my credit limit. I opened a business checking account in XXXX with the same bank and my business itself did suffer throughout the year in XXXX, but I never used my credit card for that business in any way. I noticed in XXXX that once the business checking account had fallen into the negative for about {$300.00}, a few months later the bank closed out my personal credit card and then sent me a letter to my home with no descent explanation. Even when I called the bank one representative had told me he could not find any real explanation as to why the bank had closed out my personal credit card with them. I put in a request to speak to someone such as a manager and even when I did get that call a few days later from a manager, they still gave me generic info with no specific reason to the closure of my credit card other than they have the ability and right to close out any account at any given time. Closing out my personal credit card hurt my credit rating and was so uncalled for unless I had not taken care of that particular account in which again, I know I did. To resolve the problem, my request is that the bank reopen that account, or I will also file 2 more complaints. One with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and one with the NJ Attorney General Office."
4137,"Account disclosures sent by Wells Fargo are misleading and deceptive and do not adequately describe how excess payments for 0 % promotions are applied. The disclosure states "" Your minimum payments will be applied first to lower APR balances before higher ones. Payments in excess of the minimum payment will generally be applied to balances with higher APRs first ''. However, the disclosure falls short in describing how excess payments will be applied when only 0 % APRs exist. I have three 0 % balance transfer balances with different expiration dates. When I send in excess minimum monthly payments, the payments are spread among the three balances although they don ; t have the same due date. One balance had an expiration date of XX/XX/19. I made a payment on XX/XX/19 in an amount sufficient to payoff the balance. Since the payment was spread between the three accounts, the expiring account started to accrue interest. This practice is deceptive since each loan was taken out at separate times and have different due dates. Each loan also required payment of a 4 % balance transfer fee. Excess payments should be applied based upon the loan expiration date, not spread to balances that may not mature for several months, up to one year."
4139,"I contacted Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX asking for help to lower the interest rate in order to make my monthly payments more affordable. To be honest I don't even know my interest rate and the rep never disclosed it. I only see an electronic payment due date and payment amount. I am struggling to make my monthly payment and asked the rep for XXXX XXXX XXXX. My last payment was on XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} and I missed my XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payment and I now owe {$530.00}. I told the rep I could only afford {$50.00} or {$65.00} on a balance of {$2700.00} with my credit limit at {$2500.00}. I've had this card since XXXX  and my balance as consistently been at {$2500.00} or {$2800.00} for the past XXXX years. I've been maxed out the whole time and the reps resolution was to close my card and remove my XXXX rewards. The account was considered closed to me because it was maxed out!! My balance never goes down. I usually was making anywhere from {$83.00} to {$120.00} but with inflation and everything else I simply can't afford to make payments on a card that never changes the total due. I asked if I can make lower payments and stretch out payments to pay the balance off. She said we can't do that. She ended up closing the card but advised I will continue to pay interest and late fees. So basically I will probably end up paying another several XXXX dollars with no benefit to me but full benefits to Wells Fargo Bank. I want to make payments but would like some flexibility and help so I can successfully meet my financial obligations and not fail. I have concerns because each month I am paying approximately {$18.00} in interest, {$40.00} late fee and {$46.00} in cash advance since my card is over its limit amount. So many fees!!! The added fees are increasing my balance but also adding on extra fees making it impossible to bring the balance under my maximum {$2500.00} limit. Wells Fargo even sent me a letter saying to call if I need assistance but they really don't have anything for me. This is causing me extra financial stress."
4140,"Wells Fargo allowed 2 charges to go through on my account for item I did not purchase and did not walk out of the store with. Wells Fargo refuses to provide anything that has my signature on it and continues to deny my claim. I have contacted them over 50 times between emails and phone calls and no one is helping me. 
The total charge amount was on XX/XX/2021 in the amount of {$3400.00}. This amount came about in two separate charges, the first amount was {$1000.00} and the second amount was {$2300.00}. I do not have the date it was charged because I do not have access to the account anymore. They temporary credited my account and reversed it several times and then refuse to provide and proof for the reversal. These fraudulent transactions caused sever hardship and caused my bank account to go into negative several thousands of dollars."
4141,"On XX/XX/2022 there was a withdrawal of {$500.00} that we, my husband or myself, don't recognize. As a result my husband called the bank immediately to report this and get a new card, which was mailed some days later but we're given a temporary number in order to pay with if it was necessary. My husband have talked several times with people at the bank asking for a *video* that was taken when at the ATM machine. These people have promised to look into that to no avail, at the every body refer that the transaction was done at that ATM without irregularities. They can not provide the video or they are unwilling to provide it. 
I hope that with your agency 's help they will provide it. 
Thank you in advance for your help."

4145,"XX/XX/2019 I applied for a Secure Credit Card, application # XXXX for {$300.00}. The amount was to be debited to my checking account and credit the credit card account. I applied for this secure card using my own money in the checking account to be able to build my credit. But the application was denied. I visited the banking center where I applied for the credit card from and was told the card was denied. I received a letter several days later and I again visited the bank and I was told the bank does not issue secure card any more effective from XX/XX/2019. I explained, I applied for the card on XX/XX/2019 so it does not affect my application and no solution was offered during my visit."
4146,"I gave access to XXXX XXXX XXXX to my Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX credit cards to transfer funds to me. I got cash advances and wrote balance transfer checks and XXXX XXXX  XXXX agreed to make payments to the credit card companies to pay for the withdrawals. They made payments initially but then reversed the payments. The reversals resulted in my card credit limits being exceeded by a factor of 3.5. Wells Fargo notified me that my card account had been closed and that the balance was - {$170.00}. I requested them to send me a check to take the balance to XXXX and they did. Shortly after, the balance went to - {$25000.00} after XXXX XXXX  XXXX reversed their payment. The credit limit on the account was {$17000.00}. The credit limit on the XXXX account was {$20000.00}. The balance soared to {$72000.00} after XXXX XXXX   XXXX reversed their account payments. One payment that was reversed was for {$52000.00}.

I am a Wells Fargo Customer since XXXX. 

I am sorry to write again but I have left emails and voices mails for two Wells Fargo executive employees for the last seven days and no response. 

I was dealing with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX was passing me over to do more mediation and I called him seeing if I could have my representative on the call when we meditate. XXXX  passed me over to the fraud department and XXXX My call to XXXX was about the home equity loan that was part of my last mediation. XXXX XXXX who was mediation for XXXX said he did not know what was the correct process to apply for home equity loan. 
His words it is not a process I am familiar with. He is your mediator and does not know the process? I spoke to the fraud department XX/XX/XXXX the lady said it was not necessary XXXX employees that process a credit card application in my name. Also she told me to go back to the branch and speake to the manager or the associates and see if they knew who might have applied for a credit card with my information. Is this a real representation of your employees to tell a customer to return the the XXXX location after seven years and see if they knew anything. Half of the associates are probably not around anymore plus they would think I am delusional. 
I want to speak to management at XXXX that can help me. 

Respectfully, XXXX XXXX"
4151,"I have a Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX card, Which has a balance of {$27000.00}. The Credit Limit on the account is {$18000.00} and the Cash Advance Limit is {$10000.00} The reason for the balance being over the credit limit is due to fraudulent charges that Wells Fargo "" Refuses '' to conduct an investigation on. Wells Fargo has not provided me any documentation proof, showing anything of where they have investigated this nor how they have come to this conclusion. The reason for the claim they state they can't investigate, they state that it's because these were disputed and the disputes validate the charge. Let me clarify, I disputed the charges trying to mark these as Fraudulent, However Wells Fargo website does not allow you to mark transactions, as Fraudulent. So in an effort to report these fraudulent charges I submitted a dispute and in the dispute I wrote DID NOT RECEIVE MERCHANDISE. Again, As It states. I didn't receive the merchandise because I didn't. These are fraudulent charges. I do not believe this investigation is being conducted in a fair manner. You are putting my credit line {$9800.00} Over the Credit limit because of these fraudulent charges which I am listing below. I believe this should be investigated, Because I did not authorize these merchants as stated in the original fraud claim. I also want documentation you reviewed during your research. I do not have an XXXX Account, Nor have I ever had one. I do not have a login for XXXX. I have not done business with XXXX XXXX nor XXXX. The email : XXXX was used in Identity Theft. Sold by thieves on XXXX. Which was confirmed in XXXX  Identity Theft Alerts.

Again, XXXX is not authorized, XXXX is not Authorized, XXXX is not authorized. I did not authorize any of these transactions yet Wells Fargo has not done anything or conducted any investigations to assist with this matter. 

Additionally on my College Card which had been stolen at the same time, The same thing occurred XXXX Charges that weren't authorized because again I do not have an uber account, and other charges as reported. These were and still are fraudulent transactions. This again was not investigated and Wells Fargo billed me these fraudulent charges. I do not believe I am liable for fraudulent transactions."
4152,"I XXXX cordless stick vacuums and came across this website that seemed to good to be true for a XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$120.00} and purchased on impulse. After realizing it did not make sense, I called the phone number listed on website listed as XXXX which went to na answering machine of a woman stating if calling about XXXX vacuum that it was a scam. I immediately called my bank, Wells Fargo and initiated a dispute. I received a credit back for {$120.00} after not receiving a product. One month later on XX/XX/2020 I received a product with the same tracking number listed for shipping of XXXX vacuum. The package was a small white envelope with a XXXX case inside. Package was listed as weight of 1kg and US $ Value of {$10.00}. On XX/XX/2020 I received a phone call from wells fargo stating that the credit would be reversed on XX/XX/2020 because the merchant claimed the package was delivered on XX/XX/2020. I explained the package I received was clearly not a XXXX vacuum bad they proceeded to tell me they can not stop the reversal of credit because they are only allowed to dispute one time with there merchant under federal laws, and since the merchant relieved a package even though not was ordered, there was nothing that can be done."
4154,I was trying to increase my credit limit with well Fargo and again it was denied twice due to that I have a fraudulent loan closed on my credit report and I told the credit services that I didnt apply for that loan but I paid it off anyways and I place a statement on my credit report but the credit agent said he didnt see it on his end but it saids that this loan that showing on my credit report is open by unauthorized person ... I would want well Fargo increase my credit limit due to I have a high balance that Im not responsible for and I send in some documents to the reconsidering dept and Im waiting on temporary credit but I havent received it just taking too long ... .but again my credit limit was denied due to that loan I have on my credit report
4158,"I filed a complaint with you a while back. This is the number you gave me. 
XXXX I asked for a check for my rewards early last summer and never received the check. I called the bank and they said they issued another check. This check never came. I called again and asked for another check and they promised they would send the check which also never came. Then the bank decided they wouldn't send the third check even though they promised me they would. Even after they promised they would send the check and then changed their mind they asked me to drive to the bank and sign a form that I have difficulty reading as the font is small and I don't have perfect vision. I had someone read the form to me and I don't understand it and it seems to imply that I lost the check which isn't true because I never received the check. I should not be required to go to the bank and sign a form since Wells Fargo promised me to send the check. In the meantime they've held onto my money since roughly XX/XX/2021 an amount over {$8000.00}. Please help me so they actually mail me the check registered mail like they promised to do. If you look online you can find Wells Fargo does this alot to people when they ask for a check for their rewards."
4159,XXXX  XXXX XX/XX/XXXX a charge of {$150.00} was charged on my debit card by a merchant assisting with a purchase when my card was not working. The charge was for a e-gift card so a purchase could be made in store but it was unsuccessful and the store mgr was unable to cancel it. She advised calling customer service who advised a refund would be processed. Days past and no refund was ever received nor was the e gift card that was purchased received. I reached out the merchant numerous times and the issue was never resolved they only stated it was being handled by a different department and the card was sent. I called numerous times over a month and a half for assistance in getting my {$150.00} back but told a mgr would call back and the gift card was sent but nothing has ever been received. I eventually filled a dispute with my bank who just recently XX/XX/27 charged my account back for {$150.00} stating it was a valid transaction even though the electronic gift card was never received nor was it authorized by me for that merchant to run my debit card for that purchase.
4162,"I ordered furniture from XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX  using the store card offered through Wells Fargo. The furniture ( 3 piece sectional and coffee table ) was delivered broken and with defects on XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately reported this issue to XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and was told the furniture would be delayed and unavailable until XX/XX/XXXX and that I'd have to call to schedule the delivery on my own since XXXX XXXX  doesn't have a department to handle this. I reached out to Wells Fargo to dispute the charge on my credit card for the sectional and coffee table only. Wells Fargo advises the dispute can take up to 60 days for resolution. When I call back to check the status around the 60 day mark, i was told that they're waiting to receive XXXX XXXX return policy and that they were unable to provide an ETA as it varies and can take 120 days or more. In the interim, I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating they made an error on my credit report. When I checked my report my balance was a zero which dropped my credit score. Prior to me ordering the sectional and coffee table, I ordered a bedroom set which was not in dispute and a balance is still due on that item which should be reflecting a balance on my credit report."
4164,"About 2 weeks ago I was looking for a credit card with 0 % introductory rate on balance transfers. I curently have just under a {$7000.00} balance on a card from another bank. I did some research online to find the best card for my situation which lead me to the Wells Fargo Platnium which has 0 % rate on balance transfers for 18 months. ( XX/XX/20 ) I applied online an during the application process I enter a balance transfer request of ~ {$7000.00}. I clicked through and finished the application and when I finished I was instantly approved ( with a hard inquiry ). But, the limit I was approved for was only {$1000.00}. I immediatly called to request a higer balance, obviously {$1000.00} limit will not do me much good if my only intention was transfering a {$7000.00} balance in the first place. Over the phone they told me I must wait 7-10 days for my card to arrive and be activated before I can request to have the balance incresed. ( XX/XX/20 ) Once the card arrives I speak to a rep over the phone and after 30 minutes they deny my request for a higher limit. So I immediatly cancelled the card because it was no use to me. 

In short, they advertised a 0 % rate on balance transfers with no aparent limit, during the application I gave the exact ammout I would need to transfer, they made a hard inquiry damaging my credit report, and approved me for an ammount well below what I requested."
4165,"On XX/XX/2018 I went in to Wells Fargo Bank in XXXX XXXX, CA. I was wanting to close my checking account, and in an attempt to consolidate banks/accounts I asked if closing my secured card would affect my credit score or if it would not be worth it to close. The bank teller told me that due to it just being a secured card ( with small credit limit ) it won't damage my score, so I continued to close that as well. However, I was told several days later that it should not have been closed due to it being my oldest line of credit. I went back in to the same Wells Fargo branch and asked if they can reopen my account without another application or pulling my credit score- as I was told incorrect information. They said there was nothing they could do for me. They mailed a check for the collateral balance of {$300.00} which has not yet been cashed out due to me trying to fight this issue. Due to the misinformation I was given at the bank, my credit score is likely to take a significant hit since that was my oldest line of credit by far."
4167,On the weekend of XX/XX/XXXX money was transferred without my knowledge or consent from my credit card account into my checking account which then was withdrawn. I contacted wellsfargo on XX/XX/XXXX and had to file the claim 3 times because they kept telling me that nothing was reported to them. Then I received a letter from WellsFargo stating that they can't send money from my checking into my credit card because I don't have enough to cover the amount. The reason being is because the money was taken out! They won't remove any of the fees or return any of the money. The amount was close to {$1000.00}

4180,"On XX/XX/XXXX I logged into my Wells Fargo Credit Card account and discovered fraudulent charges being made against my card that presented as XXXX subscriptions. Upon further investigation I found these charges to be going back to XXXX of XXXX, which at the time is as far back as I can see. I also checked current rates with XXXX memberships and the amounts do not lineup so I doubt these are in fact XXXX subscriptions. 

I contacted Wells Fargo to report the fraud and request older statements to ascertain how far back the fraud charges went and if there were any other. In my conversation with their representatives when I asked why I was never mailed a new card when the one I was in possession of had expired in XXXX of XXXX I was told there was a bad address notice on my account. When I asked how an expired card could have been used for the charges I was told they would have just kept trying combinations of dates until one worked, suggesting at no point would their security have blocked the attempts or notified me.

Two weeks later I had still not received the statements nor the new card so I called back. This time I was told the card had been mailed out in XXXX and in fact returned by the post office, triggering the bad address note, and they had simply extended the expiration date of the existing card but never attempted to contact me. 

At this point I am still waiting for the now third replacement card to be expedited as well as statements of activity from XXXX to current so I can determine the scope of the fraud. I have made it clear to the agents at Wells Fargo that I suspect somebody within their organization stole my original new card in XXXX of XXXX and began using it illegally, and that the alternative is that they have absolutely zero security measure in place to prevent fraud and would allow the most basic of attacks. 

I find it insulting that at no point did they attempt to contact me when after my mother died and the account was 30 days past due they called me immediately. It seems blatant that their only concern is receiving their money and not their customers at all. 

Unfortunately at this time I do not have the exact amounts or dates as I currently do not have access to my account online nor any of the paper work I have requested. I am submitting this complaint now and will update with all relevant dates and amounts of charges as soon as I have them in my possession."
4183,"I applied online for a Well Fargo credit card. I read all the fine print on the application and agreed to the hard credit check and proceeded with the application. I was emailed back that I was declined, reference number XXXX. When I contacted the phone number to hear why I was declined it stated, "" not enough history from a previous Wells Fargo card ''. I am currently a Wells Fargo card holder and do not use that card for anything other than a balance transfer I did in XXXX XXXX, thus the low history ''. No where was it stated that previous card history would affect my application process or I would not have applied. I have very good credit, nearly XXXX credit score and have never been rejected. I talked with XXXX XXXX, executive office case # XXXX. Originally he offered to erase the hard credit hit as the easies solution on a recorded line. Another call from him after he spoke with underwriters he retracted this and said the company would do nothing for me. This is not right and should be stated somewhere in their policy to customers before they click to run the credit application. At this point I have cut ties with them and already opened another card that doesn't use this deceitful tactic to its customers. I would like at the very least, what was promised originally, the hard hit removed as it was under false representation from the company."
4185,"On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo Bank automatically paid an internet social media subscription vendor called XXXX XXXX {$89.00} for a 6-month renewal fee from my Easy Pay Debit  Card account. This happened despite the fact that I had previously emailed XXXX XXXX  to change my subscription plan to a lower {$59.00} fee. XXXX intentionally delayed in replying to me so it could charge me {$89.00}. The original 6-month fee I paid to XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX was only {$44.00} and their automatic {$89.00} charge was sprung on me by surprise. I fear Wells Fargo Bank would have automatically paid out any amount XXXX  XXXX charged me without ever bothering to get my re-authorization first.

I immediately phoned Wells Fargo Credit Card Claims Assistance to file a claim that I had been overcharged {$30.00} ( {$89.00} - {$59.00} = {$30.00} ). Wells Fargo confirmed to me that {$30.00} was refunded via their Claim # XXXX. I thought this resolved the matter.

However, XXXX XXXX subsequently sent me emails that since Wells Fargo had a "" claims investigation pending '', they had cancelled my subscription entirely and I would have to pay them {$59.00} again to restart it. As far as I knew, XXXX XXXX already had collected and kept {$59.00} from my {$89.00} payment. But XXXX XXXX insisted I would have to get that refund from my "" bank '' which is Wells Fargo.

When I contacted Wells Fargo Claims again by phone I was told the case was closed and could not be re-opened. I even wrote a letter with full email documentation to Wells Fargo Senior VP for Claims Assistance XXXX XXXX XXXX about this, and he ignored it. 

So XXXX XXXX insists Wells Fargo must process my {$59.00} refund, and Wells Fargo refuses to do anything about it. Given Wells Fargo 's history of questionable banking practices, it may have created some internal procedure to keep my {$59.00} for itself. I would consider that fraud! 

I am already siphoning my accounts to other banks that provide proper customer service."
4186,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received my statement and noticed a late fee. I called the issuer Wells Fargo regarding the late fee on my account. I spoke both with costumer service and the costumer service supervisor. My minimum due monthly is {$410.00}. I have set up electronic payment to withdrawal from my personal bank to Wells Fargo weekly at {$100.00} per week. On my current statement there are XXXX payments XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX totaling XXXX in payments. Wells Fargo sets a statement closing date and a week earlier due date. On that they claim my XX/XX/XXXX payment was posted after the due date of XX/XX/XXXX but before the statement closing date of XXXX and will count only as an extra payment on the account. What I find unfair practices is that they say my XX/XX/XXXX payment was posted after the previous XXXX XXXX was closed and before the new statement was created even though the payment is on the statement created on the XXXX of the month of XXXX. Which they also want to count as an extra payment. They claim only the amount of XXXX fall within the due date. If you create an invoice on a date and receive a payment on that same day my payment should count towards my balance due otherwise it would have fallen on the previous statement. I have a XXXX late fee I asked them to waive along with the same scenario that occurred on the XXXX statement also. Which they refused to issue a credit for also"
4187,"Since my previous case filed with CFPB ( XXXX ) XXXX was in the process of verifying the authenticity of the police report. 

At this time XXXX has spent over a month with this process and just recently has stated to me clearly on the phone their fraud department does not challenge the reports authenticity, officers identify or the details in the report. 

They now state that my XXXX XXXX may have been compromised and for me to spend the time to research this a possible reason for the 'fraud '. I stated clearly I don't have an XXXX phone or XXXX XXXX, because my phone is on an Android platform that only interfaces with XXXX XXXX. 

Previously XXXX indicated all purchases were via a chip card and not a service like XXXX XXXX. 

This claim isn't being covered under their advertise "" Zero Liability Protection ''. I've never give authority for any person to use my card or phone to buy anything, so this should be a very simple case, however more and more excuses are being used to make this issue go away."
4188,On XX/XX/2021 was charged a late fee for {$29.00}. I have never been late on this account. I never received the statement via the USPS. I contacted Wells Fargo in writing asking for the fee to be waived. Wells Fargo sent my a huge packet of statements instead and did not address my written request.
4189,"On my Wells Fargo credit card there is a charge for {$2500.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2022. I have not made this purchase. I do not recognize what this purchase is for. I have not given the credit card information to this merchant. I have not received anything from this merchant. Regardless, for some reason the disputing functionality does not work on wellsfargo.com and I need this to be disputed. Hopefully someone via this channel will be able to help. I have noted the transaction on attached screenshot."
4192,"I purchased furniture using my Wels Fargo credit card. The furniture was delivered in horrible shape and asked Wells Fargo to hold off on payment until the issue was resolved with the furniture store. They agreed to do this. 

The furniture store ( XXXX XXXX ) sent Wells Fargo a fraudulent delivery receipt that they claimed I had signed. It was not my signature, that has been verified by Wells Fargo as not mine. 

I want an answer from Wells Fargo why fraud is O.K. at their bank. They stated they did a thorough investigation into this matter ... .they did nothing as all their facts are incorrect. I never signed a delivery receipt, I was not offered a refund ; just a store credit and I never cancelled or claimed to cancel the order. XXXX XXXX  does have a guarantee that all their furniture will be delivered without any factory defects, which Wells Fargo and XXXX XXXX seem to have overlooked. 

As for Wells Fargo THOROUGH investigation ... try again!"
4193,"My complaint is that WellsFargo does not disclose how payments are applied to balance transfer fees or other fees. There is no written document that explains the process. They also do not provide information on the credit card statement that indicates how payments were applied to the account. For instance, how much of a payment in excess of the minimum was applied to fees, balance transfers, cash advances, or regular purchases. 
This practice has caused me to incur interest charges on my purchases. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a payment of {$460.00}. Upon calling the company and speaking to both XXXX and XXXX on XX/XX/2022 I was informed my payment was allocated as follows : {$73.00} to minimum payment ( which was only supposed to be {$71.00} ), {$160.00} to purchases and {$220.00} to a balance transfer fee that is 0 % interest. These representatives also told me that payments are applied as follows : Minimum payment, highest to lowest APR, promotional balances, fees, and lastly principal. I filed a case XXXX and was assigned to XXXX XXXX In the executive offices. She never called me. I always had to call her. She no longer answers my calls. On XX/XX/XXXX I called her and was told that she asked another department how the fee should have been applied because she could not find any language in the documents. I called again XX/XX/XXXX and she told me that department did not know, so she was waiting on another. On XX/XX/XXXX I left another message. When I never heard back I called the main number for XXXX offices and spoke to XXXX. He said XXXX mailed a letter on XX/XX/XXXX explaining the decision. I had specifically requested the findings in an email. I asked for a manager, someone above XXXX and was told they were all in meetings and XXXX would call me the next day. She never did. I received the letter on XX/XX/XXXX that said they could not document any conversations with any representative about fees. I know the exact date, time and person I spoke with each time I called. She enclosed the terms and conditions for a credit card, but it was not for my type of card, as mine was an existing card, not a new account. Nevertheless, it did not mention how fees were paid. In fact, it specifically says higher interest rate balances are paid first. She did not disclose how she determined that fees are supposed to be paid first. I have since reopened the case."
4195,"I am a victim of identity theft. Due to the Corona Virus Pandemic, we are all facing which has me sitting still at home and I saw the recent news about the multiple XXXX  Data breaches. I decided to look at my credit reports from the 3 major credit bureaus and found that someone had used my Identity. I have no idea how the theft took place. I also have no knowledge of any suspects. I did not receive any money, goods, or services as a result of identity theft. I contacted the Credit Bureau and told me to file an Identity Theft Report which I am doing. I appreciate your effort in getting this matter resolved. Thank you. Please let me know if you need any other information from me to block this information from my credit report. Thank you."
4198,"I attempted to apply for the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX card on XX/XX/XXXX over the phone with a Wells Fargo employee. I was subsequently denied this card owing to various standard credit issues. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I again attempted to apply for the same card over the phone with a Wells Fargo agent. The application was submitted and I was subsequently asked to provide a copy of my social security number to Wells Fargo. The letter I received from Wells Fargo stated, "" In order to approve your application '' a copy of my social would need to be provided. I then proceeded to comply with this request.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I learned that Wells Fargo had denied my application because I was not a US permanent resident. When I asked the Reconsideration Line agent if any thing could be done to progress the application, I was told it was Wells Fargo policy to not approve unsecured loan applications from non US permanent residents. 

At no time did Wells Fargo make me aware of this restriction prior to either of my applications. After the first application was rejected, I took the steps to improve my credit position as suggested by Wells Fargo, and in good faith, applied to the bank again. 

In my opinion, I should never have been allowed to submit either application as I was ineligible for the product based on the information subsequently provided to me by the Wells Fargo agent. I have been an checking account holder with Wells Fargo for over four years now while I complete my XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX status. During that time, I have received unsolicited invitations to apply for Wells Fargo unsecured loan products, including credit cards, and I have had Wells Fargo credit cards advertised to me directly in the online banking interface. I took these as a good faith signal that I could apply to Wells Fargo for credit card products. 

Now, I'm left with two Hard Inquiries on my credit report, resulting in an unfair deterioration of my credit score, for a product that I had no chance of being approved for and that I would have not pursued had I have known at the time of applying that I was not eligible for the product."
4201,I did not receive a bill for my outstanding credit card debt with Wells Fargo. This is hurting my credit score and it is very tough to make payments with the global pandemic happening. I owe them close to XXXX $ and I haven't been able to pay since XX/XX/2020due to financial hardship.
4202,"XX/XX/XXXX, I opened up a checking and savings account at Wells Fargo. I also got a secured credit card of {$500.00}. The Wells Fargo representative told me that he was trying to help me build my credit score and if I paid on time my account will be reviewed every XXXX months and my balance would be increased. They never reported my payments over a five-year period and which according to Wells Fargo I was late three times by XXXX hours over a 5 years period. I repeatedly requested assistance and answers as to why I was not having my limit increased as I met all the requirements that was presented to me by the representative with no resolve. I finally closed the account XX/XX/XXXX. The representative and Wells Fargo simply lied and did nothing but take my money little by little with unjustified fees. They literally just took advantage of me at a time I was trying to better my life."
4204,"I am an authorized user. I have been in contact with the Executive Office since XX/XX/2018. The account is not appearing on XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX."
4206,"Wells Fargo lied to me about previous deposit and credit card accounts that were opened in my name prior to me opening an account. Then after opening deposit and credit accounts allowed the fraud to continue ruining my credit and leaving me destitute. 
XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX"
4207,"On XX/XX/21 my XXXX XXXX XXXX balance was PAID IN FULL online. On XX/XX/21, a {$2.00} "" interest charge '' was charged on a ZERO balance, which is arbitrary and fraudulent. This charge was discovered on XXXX thanks to credit reporting apps showing my payment was "" late ''. I immediately paid fraudulent interest and disputed via customer service call with XXXX XXXX XXXX. The money was refunded/reversed to me but there is still a derogatory remark on my credit. Me and my mortgage company received a letter refusing my dispute."
4208,Applied for a Wells Fargo Credit Product and have not received a response. I took the hit to my score via credit inquiry. I never got a reference number and the only way I could check the status is calling some number I found offsite. Kept telling me someone is reviewing the application.
4212,"Again ... .Wells Fargo is failing to address why a fraudulent signature is acceptable at their bank. They claimed a delivery receipt was provided to them ... which is true ... but it was fraudulent ... and did not contain my signature, which has been verified NOT to be mine by a Wells Fargo manager. 
I want to know why it was accepted? This has not been addressed in any of your so called letters or your THOROUGH investigation. I will keep filing complaints until this question is answered : "" Why is fraud acceptable at Wells Fargo? ''"
4214,This is a complaint for credit card denial dated XX/XX/XXXX. The reference number XXXX for denial. I and discussed my credit history and stated the conclusion could not be correct based on the facts. They denied me for late payment I have not had a late payment since XX/XX/XXXX when I filed bankruptcy form the recession. I have a credit score of over XXXX and income of over {$100000.00}. I told them i would provide my tax return. I have less than {$32000.00} in total debt and {$30000.00} of that is on installment loans with payment of {$1100.00}. I told them the reason i had inquires was to get a business line of credit because my company was expanding and sales has increased over 300 %. So given that information it's not clear how I could be denied.
4218,The account shows that it is late I was 30 days past due. That is incorrect account was fraudulently used and I paid the balance in full once I was aware. The bank said if I pay in full I will not be reported negatively on my credit.
4220,"When having the XXXX account, the company switch there payment services to wells fargo, I was unable to have access to my account, because I was not given the log in, instructions when they were merged, and during this time I was having late payments being reported to my account, and when I was attempting to contact XXXX, there was not communication back. I would like these late payments removed because it lack of communication when being informed Wells Fargo was taking over, and I was unable to make the payments because of it. The months are listed below XXXX XX/XX/2016 XX/XX/2016 XX/XX/2016 XX/XX/2016 XXXX"
4221,"I applied for a credit card on XX/XX/2021 with Wells Fargo Credit Card they sent me a letter today XX/XX/2021 that they could not verify my identity and that I would call them. They asked me for my date of birth, my address, my last 4 of the social. They answered me that they could not verify my identity and I had to apply again without asking other questions without asking me for any information to verify my identity, only that I would apply again as if that would not affect my credit. So I asked to speak to another person who refused to help me. I am being discriminated against for being XXXX, I told that person that I had had a mortgage with Wells Fargo and he told me that they did not care, I told him I had XXXX on the credit score and that he had not denied the application, they only had to verify my identity and hang up the call. They want me to apply again I don't know with what intention since the credit is excellent and they did not deny me the card their excuse is that they can not corroborate my identity but they do not give me alternatives to do it I feel discriminated against because of my XXXX  they treated me like XXXX."
4224,"Last month plus there have been several instances of obvious fraud ( online XXXX transactions over the course of a month plus outside of the area where we live ). They did not catch it and will not stop the card because it is my wife 's card. I understand that they can not give me information about my wife 's account, but a simple call to their fraud department and they would have easily seen that the charges were fraudulent, but they refused to do even that."
4226,"On approximately XX/XX/XXXX I went to make a purchase at the XXXX near my home. I was asked to confirm my mailing address. I was told the address I provided was incorrect. I was then asked to provide other identifying information, which I did. I was then advised that the address on file was listed as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX which, oddly enough, is my ex-wife 's address. 

I then went home and contacted Wells Fargo to change the address and ask why they would have my ex-wife 's address in the first place, as I had never provided this to them ... nor had she. In addition, I have never contacted XXXX 's requesting a change of address. 

They did say they would change the address to the correct one, which is XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) XXXX, XXXX. They also said that they had received notice from the United States postal service for a change of address for my mail, which I found odd as I am still recieving all my other mail. Sure enough, I also received information from my daughter that my XXXX 's bill had been arriving at her mother 's address and that they had been returning it to the Post Office. 

I contacted the US Postal Service, as suggested by the Wells Fargo representative, and they said they had no record of a change of address. I then followed on by opening a case with the US Post Office Investigations department, Case ID : XXXX. 

I also filed a formnal complaint with Wells Fargo, case id # XXXX. I was then contacted by the person assigned to this matter, XXXX XXXX, who said that she had investigated the matter and that a change of address due to returned mail had been recieved from the Post Office in XX/XX/XXXX. ( which would have been my ex-wife returning the mail ). But, this never occured, because the address had not been changed on XX/XX/XXXX. When I asked about this, I was told that the matter had been resolved. 

I mentioned that, in my mind, the matter had noit been resolved whatsoever and asked that I be provided with the documentation from the post office. I also asked how Wells Fargo had recieved my ex-wife 's address again and attempted to explain that the issue was not with the change of address back to the correct one, but the change of address to the incorrect one.  She said this is not the matter that she was investigating. She also said that she could not provide any additional information, nor documentation, as there was none to provide. When I asked, then, how she recieved the address from the Post Office she said, there is no information to provide and this matter is resolved. 

So, I hung up and called the executive branch of Wells Fargo Customer Service, who re-opened the case and re-assigned it to XXXX XXXX. 

A similar thing had happened in XX/XX/XXXX, when I attempted to obtain information by using the account number on my card. I was told that I had been upgraded to an "" elite '' card and that this had been mailed to my address on file weeks earlier, although I had never received it."
4234,"My company, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and me were issued a credit card by Wells Fargo account number ending in XXXX. That account awards points based upon account activity. Account information is provided on the website. The website states on many points I have. In XXXX, Wells Fargo deleted XXXX points as expired. All of the transactions are viewable on the website for the account. Nowhere on the website that I could see did Wells Fargo warned me that any of the points would expire. Since all the transactions are on the website there is no need to look at statements. I note that statements posted to the website separate and distinct from the website pages contained in a small print that points would expire, which statement is separate and apart from the table that they provide for points earned and used and at the end of a long paragraph. Nowhere on the table for points earned is there any statement of points to be expired, no asterisk or footnote or any indication that points would expire. An obvious attempt to obfuscate the fact that points would expire with the obvious intent that cardholders not use their points. The failure to state points to be expired on the website, was fraudulent and misleading and contrary and contradictory to the statements published on the website. As result, Wells Fargo should reinstate the expired points or pay me the value of the expired points. Even if the statements would otherwise arguably be sufficient, note that Wells Fargo made the effort to highlight the amount due, but never did the same for the number of points to expire. A further indication of an attempt to obfuscate the fact that points would expire and therefore attempted to defraud the cardholder from the use of their points."
4235,I recently opened a Wells Fargo credit card and am experiencing difficulty making payments to the card online. I have made four payments from a non-Wells Fargo account and I discovered this is Wells Fargos limit for making payments from a non-wells Fargo deposit account and Wells Fargo wont allow me to make anymore payments online this month. They offered me the option of paying over the phone or opening a Wells Fargo deposit account. This is an inappropriate restriction on consumers and appears to be a potential ploy for Wells Fargo to have consumers open deposit accounts with them. It is not fair to consumers to restrict consumers making payments and potentially leads to possible debt issues down the line. Wells Fargo has terrible customer service and will pursue closing my credit card.
4240,"Dear CFPB, I am reaching out to you, the U.S. government agency that makes sure banks, lenders, and other financial companies treat consumers fairly, after communicating with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. ( Wells Fargo ) as instructed and required under Regulation Z did not resolve the issues.

In regards to 12 CFR Part 1026, Truth in Lending ( Regulation Z ) : Part 1026, Section 1026.12 ( c ) Special Credit Card Provisions [ Section 1026.12 ( c ) ], Wells Fargo is in non-compliance by not fulfilling its obligations under such regulations. Further, based on Wells Fargo 's response, it appears that I was not treated fairly. With your assistance, I am seeking a satisfactory resolution."
4241,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I paid off my Wells Fargo credit card, as it was in collection status. Due to financial struggles, I never had the chance to pay it off for almost four years prior to this. After paying it off, Wells Fargo informed me by letter that it will be reported to all three credit bureaus as closed & that it can be removed, along with the late payments from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. However, that status has never changed and the account is being reported as a "" charge-off ''. I've disputed this account with the three credit bureaus, only for the dispute to be denied."
4242,"I contacted the WF with the issue below and I was informed that the issue will be addressed. It wasn't. 
1 ) Charge to card of foreign transaction fees. 
In XX/XX/XXXX I called WF and inquired if the card carries foreign transaction fees. As I was told it doesn't I have used the card during my trip in XXXX in XX/XX/2017. 
I was told by the CSR that I was misinformed and that the fees will be refunded. They were not. 
2 ) Foreign Currency ( MXN to US $ exchange fee ). The listing in T & C I inquired after the transactions were conducted that the WF takes its fee from the average of the market spot rate trading day. However the lowest of the trading band for MXN to US $ was at the lowest XXXX with the highest on XXXX ( XX/XX/2017 ) so the questions I have to WF are as follow : why the transactions have applied rates of outside of the trading band for that day : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX which point to WF gaming the exchange rate in its favor without proper disclosure and detriment to consumers. 

3. Account bonus issue. As per disclosed marketing agreement by WF the account will receive a {$200.00} credit bonus after its initial {$1000.00} or more purchase threshold. Although I have met and exceeded this qualifier the {$200.00} credit has not been posted contrary to the credit card offer."
4244,Wells Fargo uses XXXX ( XXXX Account Updater ) and will not allow me to opt out. They shared my new information with XXXX and XXXX gave my new card number without my authorization to the merchant.
4245,I've had this secured credit card with wells fargo for almost 3 years and never have they ever offered to increase my limit! I've been a customer since 2007 and I've been making my payments and doing my best to keep it under the limit. I've paid the card off several times and still no increase in credit limits. I was told before applying if I pay on time for 6 months my limit would increase. It's been 3 years where the XXXX is my credit limit increase?
4247,"I have been a customer  of Wells Fargo  since   XX/XX/XXXX . I  started off with a secured credit card with a deposit of {$500.00}. After a year of use they refunded my deposit and increased the line to {$700.00}. Abo ut 6 months to 1 year l ater I had applied for an increase and they countered with {$900.00} limit. With my current liabilitie s ( mor tgage, car payments, etc,  my DTI is  only 25 % ). My current  credit score flu ctuates between mid and high  XXXX .  Income  is  XXXX  annually. I do have  XXXX  negative items from high school / college year s ( w hich have been paid off yet still lingering on my report - probably why I do n't have a  XXXX  score at the moment ). However, my report states  XXXX  missed payments on all accounts and my utilization is currently at 22 % ( and again Debt to income ratio is only 25 % ). I do not have any bankruptcies. I also had over {$50000.00} last year in a savings PMA account with  Wells Fargo.  Regardless of this they still would not increase my limit over {$900.00}. I applied with   XXXX   and I now have a {$16000.00} credit limit with  XXXX . This card allows me to make every day purchases while still keeping my utilization under 30 % ( which is known as good utilization ). As a result I had moved all my accounts over to  XXXX . The aforementioned facts are to help you understand why I am filing a formal complaint. I feel that  Wells Fargo ' s business practices are unethical. Considering credit is extremely important in all financial aspects in America, I feel suppressed by unwarranted reasons. The letter I had received in the mail had said I was denied due to "" inquiries in last 2 years on credit report and high balance as compared to credit limit or revolving line ''. I had called customer service and expressed the inquiries were due to my home purchase last year. I had also asked how they could perceive a 22 % credit utilization as "" high balance ''. She said I was not privy to know what they considered "" high utilization '' as it 's part of their proprietary algorithm. That does n't seem very compliant with the fair credit reporting act. The last reason was "" insufficient length of time accounts on credit report has been established ''. I have an account that is over 10  years old,  without missed payments, active and in good standing. Again she would not inform me what they considered a "" sufficient length of time ''. Overall I feel that banks and credit lendors have an ethical responsibility to inform clients of their business practices and educate their clients as to achieving better credit status. I feel unfairly suppress ed by Wells Fargo and I hope others can learn from this experience.   Unfortunately closing the card would only hinder my credit status."
4250,"On XX/XX/21, I discovered a {$5000.00} unauthorized cash advance was made on my Wells Fargo credit card ending in XXXX. At approximately XXXX XXXX. on XX/XX/21, there were no other cash advances listed or pending, and after reporting it to Wells Fargo, this card was closed. A new credit card was issued. 
On XX/XX/21, I went to a Wells Fargo branch office, and discovered that my savings account ending in XXXX had received the {$5000.00} from the credit card, and then unauthorized XXXX transfers of this amount going to an individual unknown to me had been made. This savings account was closed. 
On XX/XX/21, I went to the same branch, and reported that an additional unauthorized cash advance of {$5000.00} was taken from my closed credit card ending in XXXX. This money was deposited into my new savings account ending in XXXX, and then {$5000.00} was transferred with XXXX to the same unknown individual. 
On XX/XX/21, the Wells Fargo online fraud unit concluded that I, or someone I authorized, committed the above mentioned felonies. I did not. 
On XX/XX/21, XXXX XXXX from the Wells Fargo XXXX unit, stated that I had been a victim of online fraud, and that there were various attempts from XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX to access my account. She had gone over my history, and determined I had never taken a cash advance or used the XXXX system. 
My complaint is that Wells Fargo did not properly monitor my accounts, and allowed subsequent fraudulent transactions to be made after I made my initial complaint to them. 
I would like this to be resolved because my credit card is still showing that I owe {$10000.00}, which includes the two withdrawals, fees and interest. 
I have had a checking account with this bank for 26 years, and find this treatment outrageous."
4252,I received a credit card from  Wells Fargo  on   XXXX   XXXX   with a credit limit of {$13000.00} in mine and my mothers name. Neither of us have requested this card. I understand  Wells Fargo  is in the middle of fraudulent hearings about these issues and they seem to still be practicing these horrific habits.     I will be reaching out to  Wells Fargo  but wanted to report this.
4253,"On or about Friday, XX/XX/2020, we applied for a Wells Fargo Visa card to transfer a balance for 0 % interest to pay off a XXXX XXXX card. Upon approval, which was with minutes, we were given a {$4000.00} credit line. That amount was less then we needed and decided we did not want another credit cards. We immediately, called Wells Fargo and asked for a higher credit line to be able to transfer the entire balance. We were told that they would not raise the credit line. We told them if that was the case, we wanted to cancel the account and stop any balance transfers. We were told that they would stop any transfers but we would have to wait 3 days to close the account because we had to wait until the account processed. On or about the XXXX of XXXX we called and were surprised to find out that we had a balance of about {$3800.00}. They had in fact had made the transfer against our wishes. We talked to a supervisor and was told that they could not reverse the transfer and we needed to call XXXX XXXX and tell them to transfer the money back and at that time she ( at Wells Fargo ) would waive the transfer fee, she also stated that the account had been closed as requested. We did that and XXXX XXXX stated they would look into it but they didn't see a problem. On or about the XXXX of XXXX XXXX called us and stated that because of their policies, they could not just transfer the money back and Wells Fargo would have to mark the transfer as a mistake of fraud and then steps could be taken to send the money back. XXXX XXXX connected a 3 way conference call with Wells Fargo Customer service. After over and hour of phone transfers and on hold times Wells Fargo told us that they could not just do that and that the case would have to be escalated to their Wells Fargo Complaints Executive Office. After Wells Fargo hung up the person at XXXX XXXX stated the she could not understand why Wells Fargo was making such a big deal about it but it was not the first time she had bad dealings with Wells Fargo. On or about the XXXX of XXXX we started to receive calls from 800 numbers but no messages were left. Finally on or about the XXXX of XXXX, we received a call with a message but we were unable to understand the person talking, and were only able to get a call back number. We called back the number and talked to a gentleman that checked to see who called us and said a decision had been made but he would not discuss it with us but would have a XXXX call us, as he was the person assigned to the case and the person made the decision. This XXXX called us the same day, He was very rude and acted like he was reading off a script and would not let us talk. Every time we tried to explain to him what the problem was and the time line he state to be quite and let him finish. He told us that if we wanted to cancel things it had to be within 7 days of the application. After he was done we stated that he had not mentioned the phone conversions from the XX/XX/XXXX and that those conversations would change his decision because we spoke to a customer service person from Wells Fargo within minutes of the application and instructed them to stop any transfers and close the account. He stated that they had no record of any phone calls about this account until XXXX of XXXX and that was after the 7 day period. He was very rude, would not listen and basically call us liars! I will admit that during all of this there was times that I got very upset and and did use some nasty language, but I was being called a liar at all levels during this process. Bottom line here is Wells Fargo made a fraudulent and unauthorized money transfer, and is charging a transfer fee. They say that record all phone conversions, but it is clear they only keep the ones that support their fraud. I have attached my phone history and it clearly shows the dates to support the time line. Also the fact that the first supervisor told us that the account had been closed as requested also supports our case."
4255,"When I go online to sign into my  account with Wells Fargo Bank, they have a credit card advertisement for a {$200.00} bonus after spending {$1000.00} with the new card. I found it very tempting and applied online. They responded 'pending ' after I submitted my application. Then I received their letter of disapproval of my application. The reason they gave me was I have 'no consumer accounts with Wells Fargo ' . I have an account with them sin ce 1967.  Ca n't they find me in their stupid system?     I believe they deny my application is because of my last name and my age as well as they are stingy about their {$200.00} bonus. What kind of stupid reason they conjure up to deny me credit -- not a WFB customer? I hereby request that they triple check my account with them and give me some better reasons for disapproval or simply approve me."
4256,"I had an open credit line of {$8700.00} with a XXXX balance. It was closed by the company. When I inquired about the closed account, they stated they could not reopen due to the risk associated with the account. I advised them that the disclosure I received did not state that they could close the account due to inactivity. ( That was the initial reason I was given, then it went to a risk situation after I made a formal complaint ). I was going to use this for my home improvements when I moved into our new home on XX/XX/2019. I am requesting to have the account reopened without a credit check as I have never been late on this account and paid my balance in full."
4262,"I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found 90 days late payment on the dates XX/XX/2017, XXXX - XX/XX/2017, XX/XX/2017. I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."
4265,I Make payment 's from the same bank account XXXX bank ) every month in full on my Wellsfargo Credit Card. Now a days it taking them 5 or 6 days to credit my credit card. On XXXX XXXX I made a payment in full it was taken out of my XXXX checking account. But it XX/XX/2021 and it's still not credited to my visa credit card. Help
4266,"I initiated and entered an consumer credit Transactions with WELLS FARGO with my open ended credit plan XX/XX/2013. 
WELLS FARGO then alleged i had unpaid late alleged obligation, Which they then charged off and closed the account XXXX. No federal law under Truth in Lending or FCRA statutes does it mention LatePayments in connection with my open ended credit plan. 15 USC 1602 does however say an account can not be closed without my the original creditors written consent. Also a natural person can not assume any debt, because pursuant to 18 USC 8 the United States assumes all obligations. WELLS FARGO is attempting to collect an alleged debt from me ; in the process harming my consumer report and my reputation which is a violation of 15 USC 1692d ( 1 )."
4271,"To whom it may concern, I have been a Loyal Wells Fargo Bank customer since XX/XX/XXXX. Just Recently I received a letter from Wells Fargo Bank advising me that my credit limit would be reduced by {$1400.00}. The reason being that the amount I owed on other credit cards was too high, that I had too many cash advances in one year, and that my payment to Wells Fargo was too low relative to the balance I owe. On this last point I understand that if I make the minimum payment only, I will pay a lot more in interest charges. I have been paying a little more than the minimum which Wells Fargo sets so I do not understand why this would be a issue as long I am current with my payments, which I have always been. 
I feel Wells Fargo lowered my current limit intentionally so they would be able to charge me more fees in case I went over my limit. In over 20 years of banking with Wells Fargo I have yet to default on any account. I am going through a personal financial crisis right now but I have managed to keep all my payments on time. I expect by years end to have my situation under control and I have been gainfully employed at the same company for 20 years. I believe Wells Fargo uses this type of situation to take advantage of customers and turn a bigger profit also by lowering my credit limit they cause my credit score to go down. Thank You"
4273,"Hello, XX/XX/2019 - I called Wells Fargo to learn about how I could apply my next payments for my Wells Fargo Business Card toward a {$600.00} cash advance. After I did the cash advance I learned the interest rate was 26 %. ( Wow ). 

The customer rep told me that all payments went toward the "" lowest '' interest rate first. I challenged that as I felt it is unfair to the consumers. So I asked if I could make a directed payment to my cash advance and was told "" no ''. My payments would go first to the finance changes and then 1 % of the balance, and the remainder would be split toward the cash advance and the other Purchases & Other Charges. 

I don't think this is fair. As a new small business owner, I was attracted to the XXXX percent finance charges for the first 9 months promotional period. I think the 26 % interest on cash advances should be highlighted as caution statements and maybe even as a flag on the ATM screen when making a cash advance decision. Kind of like the questions about "" ATM fee charges '' before you make an ATM transaction."
4274,I made a payment in the amount of XXXX and well fargo put half of it on hold and I was told I need to wait four days for the hold to be released now this is the sixth time they have done this I havent seen other banks I do business with would put this my payments on hold now Im worried that I will be charged interest for cash advances and I was charged interest last month but I paid my cash advances in full and I cant afford to keep paying interest and I will not pay them .... but I technically paid my well fargo credit card in full but I only have XXXX available credit in my card and that not right at all ... .. I dont know what well fargo expect me to do ... XXXX all I want is for my credit card to be paid in full so I dont get any interest or late fees reported to my credit report and they keep putting my larger payments on hold and each time I have to go to the library and fax in documentation to release the hold early and I dont have lots of money and fax cost me ton of money
4275,"I accepted a promotional offer from Well Fargo. At the time they did disclose that payments would be applied to the highest interest rate above the minimum payment. However, what they did not disclose was that you have no method to pay off particular portion or charges leaving zero options to avoid paying interest except paying off the card in full. My under standing was that their was an up front fee. Their was no disclosure that my actual interest rates would be higher because of Wells Fargo conceived limitations to how a creditor can pay off balances in a payment system. 

Furthermore, I was told their was no disclosure about the payment limitation nor one about the fact that some of your "" Balances are Subject to Interest Rates '' when I agreed to the offer. 

In review. Instead of being charge the disclosed flat rate ( 4-5 % ) I'm actually paying 5 % plus 21.99 % variable rate on 10 % of my account balance. I have no idea how they came to that figure because I paid off the card prior to accepting the offer and they refused to disclose it and/or mail me anything once I questioned them. Even if I wanted to pay off those "" Balances Subject to Interest Rates '' I can not do so because Wells Fargo 's designed/programmed the to do just the payment system to be able to collect additional fees not disclosed. 

I find that to deceptive business practices."
4276,My wallet was stolen and someone used my information to open an account fraudulently
4280,"I made a payment for {$100.00}, and that amount was deducted from my checking account, and the payment was applied to my credit card account. An additional deduction was made for {$7.00}, and Wells Fargo can't explain to me why it was done nor was this money it applied towards my credit card account. I called Wells Fargo customer service a number of times with no luck of resolution."
4281,"An extra XXXX dollar amount is reported on the card for a purchase I didn't make. 
It is a wells fargo based credit line from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Wells fargo did not respond. 
XXXX 's submitted something promising to call me back but I've heard nothing. 
I reported this on the XX/XX/XXXX when I received an email. 
It may be phishing, but it is irresponsible across the board and jeopardizes everyone."
4282,"I recently requested and received a XXXX XXXX credit card through Wells Fargo. When I went online to set up my account, I noticed that it was impossible to set up Autopay which pays the bill automatically. In addition, it is possible to request text and email notifications of OVERDUE bills, but only email notifications of upcoming bill due dates. In other words, they are DELIBERATELY making it more likely that a consumer will miss paying a bill, while ensuring that they will be quickly notified of any past due bills and associated extra fees. 
I feel strongly that banks and credit card companies should be penalized for such practices. Is there a list, or could one be created, a kind of Wall of Shame, for credit cards that rig the system against consumers?"
4283,"On my one year anniversary statement, I noticed Wells Fargo charged me a returned check fee for {$15.00}. They also sent a letter that said that my most recent automatic payment was returned unpaid/account not found and that as a result, the Automatic Payment Feature on my account had been canceled. I am not aware of being enrolled in any automatic payment feature. This type of error has not occurred before on my account and I manually pay my bill each month. I called Wells Fargo and the customer service representative was helpful and told me he could reverse the {$15.00} and that it would show up as credited on my next monthly billing statement, just to pay my bill as normal."
4286,"On my WellsFargo Bank Credit Account there was a Promotion that recently came to an Expiration on XX/XX/XXXX. I paid everything down to a last statement balance of {$450.00} prior to my promotion Expiring ; yet, couldnt fulfill the contractual obligation because I was in the hospital seeking treatment for my terminal related illness. On XX/XX/XXXX I called in to the WellsFargo Bank Customer Service Center and Spoke to a Manager hoping that they would recoginze my due diligency with making payments on time and sympathize with me regarding my illness. I asked if it was possible to pay off the last statement balance of {$450.00} that was owed in order to Avoid the DI Charge in the amount of {$250.00} but to my dismay The WellsFargo Account Manager stated there was no help that could be offered, even if I was in the Hospital during the time the Promotion Expired which prevented me from paying it off by the Promotional Exp Date. Later, on XX/XX/XXXX decided to call in once more in order to ensure there was no financial relief that could be offered and again a different Account Manager stated there was nothing that could be negotiated to pay off the Principal in order to avoid the Deffered Interest Charge."
4293,"I made a payment to my Wells Fargo SECURED credit card in the amount of {$5000.00} on XX/XX/2021, posted on XX/XX/2021 from my XXXX XXXX XXXX account. 
The payment was taken from my account in XXXX on XX/XX/2021. Then showed as posted on my XXXX account on XX/XX/2021 I have paid {$17000.00} in 6 payments to this Wells Fargo Credit Card since XX/XX/2021 using the same linked account. Now, with a {$5000.00} payment to pay the card in full, Wells has put a hold on my payment for 4 business days even after having taken the money from my account and having had a valid history with the same linked checking account from XXXX, used in 6 previous transactions over the last 5 months with NO returns. They are using my fund to secure interest and not paying me or letting me use the funds on the credit card."
4296,"My husband and I opened a Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX account in XXXX this year to purchase a couch. We thought that this account was going to have a 0 % interest on it for two years. However, we received our first statement in XX/XX/XXXX, for a payment due XX/XX/XXXX after receipt of the furniture. I have now received 7 statements, made 8 payments - yet I am somehow charged a late fee every month since XX/XX/XXXX, and the payment I make is not applied to the payment due date ; it is just applied to the balance. The problem lies in that I pay all of my bills for the coming month on or about the XXXX of the month when I receive my paychecks. What this means is, according to Wells Fargo - I'm paying my payment too early. See, my billing cycle doesn't end until the XXXX of each month, so therefore, I shouldn't pay my bill till after the XXXX of each month. I did not realize this until I received my XX/XX/XXXX bill and started wondering why in the world was I receiving late charges. So I called Wells Fargo in XXXX. The gentleman I spoke to shared with me that I shouldn't be paying till after the XXXX of the month, and during that call, he noted that I had sent a payment that was received XX/XX/XXXX, acknowledged that I meant that to be for the payment due XX/XX/XXXX, and would make sure to apply it as such. That did not happen according to my XXXX statement, which indicated that my XX/XX/XXXX payment was never received, I had another late fee, and an outstanding balance. I called Wells Fargo again on or about the week of XX/XX/XXXX, and the lady I spoke to said that she would look into this. It is now XX/XX/XXXX, and I still have an outstanding balance of {$70.00} due XX/XX/XXXX because the XXXX payment was not applied to my payment due, and the {$200.00} I sent in for the XXXX payment was not enough to cover both months of payments. Wells Fargo assigned a case # to my complaint today, yet I still have to pay the {$70.00} before Monday in order to keep my credit report from indicating that I have missed yet another payment and have yet another outstanding balance. I am highly frustrated with Wells Fargo - the 0 % doesn't actually result in zero extra charges with this tricky don't pay until after your billing cycle clause - they're getting their extra money with the monthly {$38.00} charges I receive because I pay my bills early. The gentleman I spoke with today, XXXX, told me in a disrespectful tone "" You shouldn't pay your bill early - that's why we put it on your billing statement. '' It also frustrates me that I have had 4 phone call conversations with Wells Fargo over the last couple of months regarding this issue - and all because I pay every bill due during the coming month on the XXXX of the month, a habit I practice to ensure what I can on my credit. That doesn't work out if you have an account with Wells Fargo. Their tricky clauses ensures they will get their extra money despite a claim of 0 % interest for a period of time. I plan to never do business with Wells Fargo again."
4299,"Wells Fargo Closed my credit card account, with out notifying me. I have a great credit score, I pay my bills on time and in full. They could not give me a response to why they closed my account other then that I am risk adverse, I have attached the paperwork plus the last credit card statement. They have told me that all my points are gone, even though I did not use them. I would like to get them back all $ XXXX, that I have earned. I am hoping you can help me on this."
4301,"Wells Fargo accepted a delivery receipt with my signature on it that was fraudulent ... .my signature is on file at the bank and they know it was not my signature. This is the 4th complaint and they have yet to address the issue why fraud is acceptable at Wells Fargo. As I have stated before, this will not stop until the question is answered. FRAUD AT A BANK IS NOT O.K. Complaints will keep racking up against Wells Fargo until they deal with this situation."
4305,"I applied for a Wells Fargo Visa credit card back in XX/XX/XXXX. During the application process, the representative who put my SS number through, got it wrong. I repeated myself at least 3 times too. It has been XXXX ever since. Each time I call, the automated service denies me as a customer. I have called for two months about this issue and I get the same run around response ... '' I have forwarded your complaint to the executive office. Someone will call you back within 2-3 days. '' They are full of it. No one has called!! 
What I don't understand is how I even got approved? They tell me they can find me in the system but it is WRONG through the automated service. How can they mess up something so important?? And it's evident they are not taking this complaint seriously. I am tired of trying to resolve this with them. I even mailed out my correct SS number on a form and it's STILL not corrected. I'll never do business with them again after I pay off this card!!"
4309,Wells Fargo  closed my card down for some bogus reason that it was n't me that applied for the card. Though I went into the branch when I signed up and they made me go into the branch and give my ID  three times .   I have    XXXX   XXXX   cre dit from a payment to my card that wells fargo refuses to send me a check for.   I 've called  100 's of tim es to get my money back and  no one will   help. This is going on for 4 months. I am late on my bills because of it.   I have no other choice WILL have FILE A LAWSUIT AND MAKE COMPLAINT WITH THE attorney general for  wells fargo  illegially holding my funds
4310,"I have several balances on a Wells Fargo credit card which were can advances with 0 % interest. I was under the assumption when I make payments it went to the oldest advance first. I find out after making a payment to pay off an expiring 0 % rate that I had to wait a day after the expiration to pay it if I wanted my balance paid off. So paying ahead of the expiration they were splitting my payments to the several advances not putting it toward the oldest advance first. I never knew this and didn't realize it until I saw an interest charge this month. 

I contacted Wells Fargo who said that's how they do it. So they do it to make themselves richer while people think they are paying off the oldest first. They are not willing to change it, I feel scanned by this unethical practice. They should be held to a standard to help people not hurt them. Something needs to be done about this type of scam."
4312,Ive been disputing this card since 2017 this account was opened fraudulently Ive filed a police report Ive filed a FTC AFFIDAVIT which Ive sent to both credit bureaus and wellsfargo and they still continue to report this to my credit report i do not know what else to do Ive done everything required by law to correct this problem but i cant seem to get them to correct the problem

Wells Fargo told my wife XXXX XXXX that in order to get the loan, the first loan on the house they were funding us for ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ca ) we must take the line of creidit which will be like a second loan on the house.

Our mortgage with Wells Fargo would be conditioned, would only be granted if we took the line of credit - Were they ( Wells Fargo ) desirous of us using the line of credit and ultimately having to pay them interest fees on the line of credit?

I hypothesize so. Entrapment.

The issue is our home loan would only be granted if we agreed to their demand we take a line of credit.

Evil. Evil. Give the customer the line of credit and hope they do not pay the full amount and charge them interest. Buyer beware indeed!!!!"
4324,"Again, Wells Fargo has totally missed the problem and the nature of the complaint.

You had me send over a copy of my signature, which you already have on file, to verify it was not my signature. The local Wells Fargo also verified it was not my signature ... but you, having no regard for a previously loyal customer, decided to accept it anyway. WHY? 

You did not do the right thing by your customer and this will not stop until you answer that question. Do not blame this on XXXX XXXX or XXXX ... this is an internal Wells Fargo problem of total lack of regard for doing the correct thing. Fraud is not ok ... .and a bank accepting it is worse."

4328,"Instead of settling my claim of 3 wrong charges and cleared the charges, Wells Fargo fraudulently created and more fraudulent charges of charges, even though we've stopped using their Visa since XX/XX/2016. There was certainly fraud created with computer maneuvering of printing tens and tens of pages of charges. I'm senior citizen and have respond to their 20-30 phone calls that three fraudulent charges should be cleared as they handled similar fraudulent charges in the past. For Wells Fargo the credit and improper trouble they imposed on us are rolling bigger and bigger like snow balls. Now each day different people called ; there has had being been ten people all claimed to be Wells Fargo authority. I am XXXX and in bad health to receive such persecution. Wells Fargo 's approach has been not reasoning but convincing me that I'm owing about thousand dollars. Bur my question is : For What particular Charges bane them ). Their 20+ pages computer print out confused the matter and looks  fraudulent."
4330,The company keeps calling me because my account is past due. I have already started a settlement process with a third-party company.
4331,My application with Wells Fargo was denied. They stated it was because of a repossession on credit report. There is no repossession on my credit report.
4332,Wells Fargo advertised cell phone insurance if the cell phone bill was paid with the Wells Fargo Credit Card. I started making my cell phone bill payments via my Wells Fargo Credit Card more than a year ago ( as required by the terms of the cell phone protection insurance being promoted ). Recently ( early XX/XX/2020 ) the phone screens cracked on two phones on the account. These were repaired at a cost of {$66.00} each ( total of {$130.00} ). Claim was submitted to Wells Fargo via Card Benefit Services web site with required documentation. Wells Fargo has refused to pay these claims.

The remainder of the funds were used fraudulently by someone else ( {$9000.00} ) I filed a dispute with Wells Fargo, they investigated the fraud and said that they had proof that the charges were mine. They refused to furnish me with the proof and insisted the charges were mine and that they are going to report it to the credit bureau. I am not responsible for the charges and want to see the evidence so I can file a police report but they are not cooperating with me. What do I do next to resolve this matter?"
4334,"I am writing today in regards to my account with Wells Fargo Account # XXXX, the reason for my request today is to ask for assistance with the late reported in XX/XX/2020. In XX/XX/2020 I had two unfortunate things happen 1. I had XXXX 2. My bank account had fraud and therefore was compromised and shut. The reason I am telling you this is because my account is on autopay so I no concerns while I was unwell that my accounts were being paid. I also was unaware that my bank account which the payments were coming from was shut down due to the fraud which occurred. Once I was well enough and made aware I quickly got the account paid up."
4336,"Wells Fargo has continued to charge huge amounts of interest to my credit card account making it impossible to keep up and which takes away significant amounts of my credit. I have tried to talk with them about it but the problem continues. 

My account was at the top of its credit limit and Wells Fargo just applied another amount of interest between three and four hundred dollars and are telling me to pay the over credit limit amount at once. 

The reason the account balance is so high to begin with is that Wells Fargo has neglected/mishandled thousands of dollars of disputed/unauthorized/or fraudulent charges to my credit card. I am due credit for these disputed incorrect unauthorized charges which would eliminate these large interest amounts. I have tried to communicate this with XXXX. and have asked for assistance of the Executive Office, but there is never any proper follow up or attempt to listen, review, and properly resolve the issues and properly credit these improper transactions. 

Interest rates have never decreased since i have had the account since XX/XX/2016 ( six years and eight months ). 

Wells Fargo has harmed my credit due to this large amount of debt showing on my credit card when they have not properly addressed and mishandled disputes. Then they add huge amounts of interest which only shows my debt to worsen. This debt is inflated and being improperly and/or falsely reported to the credit agencies, as I am disputing that this amount of debt is not owed."
4338,Wells Fargo is charging clients a minimum {$1.00} on credit card purchases even if you pay the balance the next day. I have excellent credit and I use other banks and card issuers and no other institution does this. I called them and they had some completely crazy explanation. I know it does not sound like much money but over the millions of customers they have its a big problem. Month over month Wells Fargo still has not learned their lesson. I keep them because they are my oldest card and I carry no balance. Used the card once for {$13.00} and paid off the next day and they charged me a minimum charge of {$1.00} for interest. Its a real shame.
4339,"( 30 Day Late XX/XX/XXXX ) I transferred a payment using Wells Fargo Online services. When I received a phone call from a Wells Fargo rep stating I was more than 30 days behind, was shocked. I immediately agreed to arrangements to get caught up and was told that a case would be submitted to remove 30 day late. 

I submitted a prior CFPB report and the rep said she solved issue but she was researching to the wrong billing period. I believe she was looking at XX/XX/XXXX which I was not reported as a 30 day to begin with. I was referred to the general card services #. This doesn't resolve the case."
4340,"XX/XX/2020 I open up an email from Wells Fargo asking me to contact them about an account. I am working so I have to wait until I get home. I also have a letter from them waiting for me in my mailbox saying if I need assistance to please contact them. 

I log in to my account and it says my payment is 20 days late. I have never missed a payment so I was very concerned. I called them and after being transferred to 6 different people, someone tells me that they disabled the auto-debit I had set up for payment for this account because of the recent tornado in my area of Tennessee. 

I try to get an explanation as to why they would do this but still try to say my payment is late because they turned off how I pay it. They didn't have a very food answer. I asked them if the late account would be reported late to the credit agencies and they couldn't answer that either. I wanted to let someone know that they are randomly disabling auto-debit for payments and claiming "" disaster relief '' but not letting anyone know they are doing it and not waiving the ability for payments to still be late."
4341,On XX/XX/2021 I initiated a balance transfer for my Wells Fargo credit card to pay {$8000.00} to my XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo approved it and applied the funds to my Wells Fargo credit account. By XX/XX/XXXX I noticed the credit was never applied to my XXXX account so I called both banks to inquire. Wells Fargo opened an investigation into the issue and said it would take up to 90 days to complete the investigation. I have called twice since to check on the status of the investigation and nothing has been done yet. XXXX can not do anything because they have no record of any payments from Wells Fargo. So now I am stuck paying large payments on both accounts and my credit score dropped because it shows that I have twice the amount of debt I should have. Just because they have up to 90 days to investigate doesnt mean it should take a full 90 days.
4343,"I entered the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XX/XX/2017. At that date, I had a balance of {$24000.00} on my Wells Fargo ( WF ) Visa credit card. At the time of entering XXXX XXXX under Title 10 of the U.S.C., I provided WF with a copy of my Orders. WF acknowledged receipt of these Orders for my checking and mortgage account, but after nine months have still not applied the SCRA benefits to my credit card, which oddly enough is the only account that stands to benefit from the SCRA 's protections. I contacted WF about the incorrect interest rate in XXXX and again provided them with a copy of my Orders because they "" never received them, '' even though they could see that my checking and mortgage accounts had the SCRA protections on them. WF now acknowledges via telephone that they have all of the needed documents, but are "" still processing my request. '' As of this writing, they have been "" processing the request '' for a month and a half. Since entering XXXX XXXX, I have not used this Visa card for any purchases, so all interest accrued on this card should have been capped at the statutory cap of 6 % rather than the previous 12.75 %."
4344,"As the records show within each government agency where I filed each of my complaints about the violations and/or crimes subjected against me by Wells Fargo Bank N.A and after I made all those Reports Wells Fargo Bank N.A again retaliated against me by direct threat and/or intimidation in retaliation for complaining to the CFPB and other government agencies. I believe Wells Fargo Bank N.A continuous retaliation against me is in violation of the CFPA and other applicable laws. I would like full investigation of my case which is also a human rights case against a consumer and a constituent. Wells Fargo Bank N.A fraud,  corruption, threats and other adverse actions will not silence me and if anything to happen to my freedom, safety and life Wells Fargo Bank and its involved agents, executive and/or employees must be prosecuted and held fully legally and criminally responsible. All stated herein is to my current states knowledge, belief and understanding and it is subject to anything or any correction by me or my legal representative at anytime without prior notice and without waiving my rights"
4349,"I applied for and received a new credit card that stated that there was an introductory rate of 0 % APR on balance transfers for 18 months and received paperwork to that effect. I initiated a balance transfer from a high interest credit card on XX/XX/22. Today I received a letter stating that interest would accrue starting the date of transfer. I called the company to question this and the contact person would not discuss the introductory rate. I attempted to cancel my card and cancel the balance transfer, but was told to contact my financial institution. I don't understand this as my bank has nothing to do with this. I did call the credit card company where the transfer was coming from and they said that they couldn't stop the transfer. Frankly, I not sure that the person I was speaking to understood completely what I wanted. I feel that I was mislead by the new credit card company."
4350,"My family and I are traveling on XXXX XXXX from the XXXX XXXX to California ( all day traveling ). While attempting to pay for my car rental reservation, we were surprised the company required an additional {$13.00} for the car. According to the rental company at the airport, they could only charge one card once. I called Wells Fargo requesting help so they will honor the additional {$13.00} for my family food and a bed to sleep on. The agent was adamant that because I have a secured card there was no way they could increase my limit for the transaction to go through. Despite me having plenty of money in my checking account and having this card opened for almost 10 years if not more. Seems to me that all wells Fargo cares about is making money instead of the well being of their customers. I cant imagine how difficult it would have been for them to allow a ONE TIME exception to help a stranded XXXX XXXX military family."

4353,"I have contacted XXXX 's card services executive management via email asking to contact me in regards to the poor customer service offered by Wells Fargo and have not been given a phone call. I have tried to resolve my concerns and consumer issues with Wells Fargo, in which they have not been helpful in doing so."
4357,"On XX/XX/18 I was involved in on online fraud scam with individuals who said they were from XXXX. I was informed that my computer was hacked into and was being used for setting up accounts in child XXXX, and that i would need to purchase software to get the hackers out of my computer. They told me that it would be free of charge to me and that they were transferring XXXX dollars into my account for me to buy a best buy gift card to purchase the software. They said it needed to be a gift card because they did not want me to enter my information into my computer since is was "" hacked. '' I looked in my account and saw the XXXX dollars extra in my account. I never gave them any of my account information but they were on my computer by remote access so this is how i am assuming they got my information. I saw that everything else in my account looked normal. I did not want this money that was not mine in my account so i bought the gift card. I gave them the numbers to the gift card and after them "" installing '' the software they said it was not going to work and that they needed some stronger software and then XXXX dollars appeared in my account for the next software. They were transferring money into my account without me getting a chance to say no. I did not want this extra money in my account as I saw that would be stealing from them. All of my accounts still looked normal at the time. So I purchased the XXXX on my credit card and was going to transfer the money in my account over to pay for the transaction. I gave them the numbers of the gift cards for the total amount of XXXX. 

This is when I had a gut feeling that something was wrong and called the real XXXX and found out that I was involved in scam and had to get them out of my computer right away. I then went into the Well Fargo   Branch to file a claim on fraud activity in my accounts. The banker could see that there were the two transfers for a total of XXXX dollars but we could not see where they were coming from as they were still pending. It was not until two days later ( XX/XX/18 ) that I found out that they transferred money from my own credit card as a cash advance to make me believe it was money from somewhere else. I went back into the branch on XX/XX/18 and talked with a banker who put me through to the credit card fraud department they refuse to help me because I was the one who bought the gift cards. I understand that I bought the cards but I bought them thinking that it was not my money in my account. Because the credit cards transactions are not posted right away there was absolutely no way for me to know that the money was mine. Wells Fargo has protections against fraud activity and say they will help out their customers if there is fraud activity in their account as online or credit card. 

The online department acknowledged that the transfers were fraud and not made by me but the credit card company still refuses to refund any of the amount because i was the one who made the transaction. These transactions I never would have made if I could have seen at the time, that the money was from my own credit card. When checking my account online the money transfer were only coded as "" transfer '' and I could not see where the transfer was from until two days later."
4358,"I called Wells Fargo on the telephone to try to get the bank to implement the feature of the system that would automatically block any transaction that overdraws the debit card. When I got to a certain point in the conversation, the phone automatically hung up abruptly as if it had been programmed to do so automatically by either the phone company or the bank itself, ( or the United States government? ) so that I could not effectively add that feature to my debit card."
4366,"This is the XXXX XXXX credit card issued by wells fargo. 
Someone took this card that i haven't used in a year and went on a shopping spree. I have no clue where it is and I thought that this account was closed last year."
4367,I have 2 hard inquiries that I dont recognize. I think at those 2 time that I applied for credit card but got denied.
4369,"XXXX XXXX aka. Wells Fargo. 
I purchased a large item and to get credit the seller started this Wells Fargo account with my permission. 
The account was always paid on time. 
I did a balance transfer to pay this card off. 
After the final payment went in I checked the account on-line around XX/XX/XXXX and the account said {$0.00} balance. If there was a balance at that time I would have paid that also. 
Balance transfer payment was sent on XX/XX/XXXX.

Wells Fargo acknowledges receipt on XX/XX/XXXX The due date for the payment was XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo never sent another bill in the mail after I tried to pay this account off. 
They assessed interest on the account before the payment went in. Then charged me a {$38.00} a month late fee. They said they contacted my wife and made payment arrangements but never received a payment. This never happened. My wife never talked to them. The only way I found out about this account being delinquent was seeing my complimentary credit score on my other card bills going down so I got curious as to why and requested a credit report from XXXX. After I found this account was posted as 120 days delinquent, I called Wells Fargo to settle the debt. By this time an account that was supposed to be paid off was sitting at around a {$200.00} balance. I spoke to a Gentleman in the collections department and told him I was not going to pay {$200.00}. He said that he would take a {$140.00} payment that day to clear the account. I asked him if I paid that day, if they could remove at least some of the late payment entries on my credit report since this whole late thing and the balance was up for dispute. He said he would submit a letter stating that the balance amount was disputed and that was why it was not paid until this payment. I also submitted a dispute with XXXX which only came back as paid with all of the late payment entries still on the report. I acknowledge that the payment came in late and that I initially owed them a small interest payment and the first late fee. However I checked this account on-line and it said XXXX balance. I did not know the payment came in late until I called Wells Fargo about the credit report. I feel like I was basically set-up because as I stated above, not one more bill or statement arrived in my mail after I tried to pay this account."
4370,"I called Wells Fargo because they were offering an opportunity to consolidate your credit cards and make payment interest free for 15 or more months. As part of the application that I did over the telephone, they asked which cards you wanted to consolidate. I told Wells Fargo my XXXX bank card, and my XXXX XXXX. On the XXXX I owned around {$8000.00} and the XXXX card around {$2500.00}. 
I received a letter in the mail tell me my application was accepted and I received a {$2000.00} limit. I did nothing because the card did not solve any of my problems. A week or two later I received a cardI did not use it becauseI didnt need another card I needed to consolidate my bills. I put the card in a draw. I received a bill in the mail from Wells Fargo stating they had paid {$1700.00} on my XXXX credit card. I called them and I was told it was up to me to get the money back from XXXX bank. The most they were willing to do for me was return the {$53.00} they charged me to transfer the moneyonce I return the {$1700.00}. 
I did not ask Wells Fargo to make a payment on my XXXX XXXX, I asked them to pay it OFF. Now I have two bills instead of oneboth of which I cant pay. They also are mess up my credit by using more than of their card. All of which I did not Authorize them to do."
4372,"I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and I am submitting this complaint myself and there is no third party involve. This just proves your lack of proper record keeping. Now, this item is reporting to be 30,60, and 90 days past due, yet it is closed and the balance is XXXX. Lets correct this immediately. You are required to verify for yourself but I will go ahead and remind you that this account was paid, closed and no longer active and should have reflected a status of CLOSED."

4375,A credit Card and a LOC was given by Wells Fargo for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was told that it was not on a personal guarantee. On applying for another loan from another entity there was an audit where it was revealed that Wells Fargo had actually misled me and they were on Personal guarantee. This effected my application for another loan. My business already effected by the COVID 19 has caused a serious situation for my business
4376,Wells Fargo offered a promotional rate of 3 % per year and increased it for a late payment which was totally by mistake in billing.
4377,"My mother, XXXX XXXX, took out several credit cards in my name throughout the past few years with Wells Fargo being one of them. I did not give her permission nor consent to do so. I have recently figured this out at time of her passing XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). At the time, I was living in Florida, however, drove up to North Carolina to meet with the detective in XXXX as this is the location my mother lived/passed away. During my interview with the detective XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, he explained that he conducted a search warrant of her house on the night of XX/XX/XXXX as my mothers death was being ruled as a homicide. During the search warrant, he found a pocketbook full of credit cards in my name in her room. I did not have any knowledge of these credit cards until this point. These credit cards include XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo. All of which I have had taken off my record due to result of the fraud investigations for each credit card company XXXX except for Wells Fargo XXXX. This is why I am reaching out in regard to the Wells Fargo credit card as it was included in this pocketbook in my mothers room, and I did not apply for the card. My mother fraudulently took it out in my name without my permission, awareness nor consent. 

After the meeting with the detective, I was advised to visit XXXX to check my Credit Report and to see if there were any other credit cards in my name. After multiple attempts and phone calls with XXXX, I was finally able to reset my password and get into my account XXXX my mother made the XXXX account in my name ). After logging in, all of the credit cards on my credit report were listed in the pocketbook found in my mothers room. 

Furthermore, there were two loans taken out in my name that I did not know of : Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX loan. Both of which have been deemed as fraud and taken off of my record as I did not open those loans. I have attached the document from Wells Fargo to show that they deemed the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX as fraud. This further shows that my mother has fraudulently opened items in my name with Wells Fargo in the past. 

My mother was able to take out these credit cards in my name, Wells Fargo being one of them, as she had copies of my social security card, birth certificate and drivers license. 
As my mother fraudulently opened the Wells Fargo credit card in my name, she utilized the email XXXX ( based off the record of the application that was provided to me by Wells Fargo XXXX. This is not my email and was her email. I have only had two emails my entire life : XXXX ( personal email ) and XXXX ( student email from university ). Why would I open a credit card to an email I do not have access to? I have attached the record of application as provided by Wells Fargo. 
Additionally, the record of the application that was sent to me by Wells Fargo also shows that she had lied about my monthly income of {$500.00}. I did not have a monthly income from XXXX of XXXX as I just graduated high school and was preparing for my upcoming freshman year of division one college soccer. Furthermore, I did not work my freshman year ( XXXX ) year of college. My mother fraudulently opened the credit card in my name and lied about my income. Why would I open a credit card and lie about my income? 

The record of application also states my address as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NC XXXX. Why would I list this address as my permanent address in XXXX of XXXX if I was leaving to attend XXXX XXXX in XXXX, TN ( to prepare for my freshman year of collegiate soccer ). Attached, is my transcript to show I attended XXXX in the fall of XXXX. 
After speaking to a representative at Wells Fargo, I was told that the number XXXX is associated with the account. That was my mothers number ; the individual that fraudulently opened the application. My personal number is XXXX and has been this since I was XXXX. Why would I open a credit card account to a phone number I do not have access to? 
The Wells Fargo representative also told me over the phone that the account was opened online and was pinged to an address in New York. I was not in New York on XX/XX/XXXX. In fact, it was not until XXXX when I first visited New York. My mother often had business trips to New York for her work at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I suspect this is why the online address at the time of the application was pinged to New York. 
Furthermore, Wells Fargo XXXX in the final response letter ), stated that payments were made from a joint Wells Fargo account my mother and I had shared. My mother opened this joint account and was using it, not me. I have similar proof of this occurring with the above listed credit cards as she was making payments for those credit cards from that joint account ( which I had no knowledge of until being confronted by detective XXXX XXXX. These payments from the joint account were done by my mother, therefore, it is only logical why the credit card was opened and how the payments were made. However, this was all done without my knowledge as my name was used by my mother to open up the credit card. 
Additionally, in the final response letter, it stated We are able to confirm payments that have been made to your account from your jointly owned Wells Fargo Everyday Checking account ending in XXXX. We have enclosed copies of your checking account statements reflecting payments dated XX/XX/XXXX, for {$760.00}, {$26.00}, and {$1000.00}, for your review. The payment on that joint account for {$1000.00} was used in XXXX XXXX, Virginia. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was working with XXXX XXXX  delivering food in downtown XXXX, NC on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. I have personally reached out to XXXX and included documentation that I was working on XXXX, North Carolina that day. This further shows that the joint account was compromised as my mother was solely using it. I have attached the final response letter and the documents from XXXX. 
I have not used this joint Wells Fargo account within the past 3 years as I have opened a XXXX account that I strictly use only. Attached, is my first and last billing statement with XXXX. 
I have also attached a document from Wells Fargo showing the result of their fraud investigation of the credit card. 
Attached, is a copy of the police report from the detective for the fraud of these credit cards. If you have any questions, his number is XXXX and his email is XXXX."
4383,"We made an error paying our Wells Fargo credit card and overpaid them by thousands of dollars. On XX/XX/XXXX, we contacted Wells and explained the issue before the payment processed. We were told our funds would be returned in a few days. About a week later, we called again. The date of refund was changed to 10-11 days. On XX/XX/XXXX, we were told it would be up to 30 days. We decided to close the account that has more than {$8600.00} credit balance in an effort to expedite our refund. A supervisor told my wife they would call us later that day with refund status and we could close the account at that time if we still desired. We still have not heard from Wells Fargo and no one can tell us when we will receive our refund."
4384,"XXXX XXXX XXXX v. Wells Fargo On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I called Wells Fargo Customer Service ( XXXX ) because my debit card was unauthorized cancelled even though I had sufficient funds in my checking account. Wells Fargo staff neither reinstalled my card nor presented any mitigation solution to address the issue. Also, I could not access a branch nor a ATM because does not have one in XXXX XXXX Missouri. The closest branch is located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, KS XXXX ( around 26.92 miles ), and it is temporary closed as well as is its ATM is unavailable ( app.1 ). As a result, I could no buy food, gas, or other basic products ( Fig.1 ) Due to my desperate in having the basic needs fulfilled, I called Wells Fargo couple times, and each time I got different answers so sorry, there is nothing we can do. We apologize .that boiled down in nothing. I can rush a new card by  Monday XX/XX/XXXX ; however, between XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I have been exposed to starvation for lack of access to funds. 
On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I called again Wells Fargo , XXXX , the banker escalated to the Advocacy Dept. , XXXX , that escalated to somebody else. This individual said the solution is a ATM with access code for 30 minutes. However, according to her there is not ATM in XXXX XXXX and when I gave my Zip Code XXXX, she directed me to Mississippi. 
Wells Fargo in XXXX paid {$480.00} millions is a class action for wrongdoing. It is not a surprise that this financial institution is not complying with Expedite Funds Acts when comes to make the funds deposite accessible to the costumers."
4386,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I established a banking relationship with Wells Fargo ; my opening account balance was {$50000.00}. Upon visiting a local branch in XX/XX/XXXX, a customer service representative told me that they were having a special promotion on their XXXX credit card and invited me to apply. My account balance at that time was {$82000.00}. The customer service representative paraphrased the credit card agreement, told me that my credit score was just shy of XXXX and had me sign on the screen I never received a signed copy of the agreement. 

My first credit card statement indicates that the Cash Advance APR was 23.99 % and the APR for Purchases was 0 % ; my total credit limit was {$6000.00}. I used the credit card minimally for quite some time before I started carrying a Purchase balance. I ALWAYS paid on time. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that I may qualify for an increased credit limit of {$7500.00}. A similar letter was received in XX/XX/XXXX, stating that I may qualify for an increased credit limit of {$8000.00}. 

What is absolutely infuriating is that, despite my pristine payment history ( currently my credit score is approximately XXXX ), I am being charged a 25.24 % APR. I will mention, at this point, that I am XXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo and spoke with several Customer Care agents only to be told that there is nothing that they could do to lower my interest rate. Curiously, all of the agents that I spoke with offered me a special interest rate on new purchases I declined. Equally ridiculous is that the following day I received a call from a Customer Care agent located in XXXX XXXX executive office only to have them recite the exact same spiel and confirm that there is nothing that they can do to reduce my interest rate. I am raising this issue to determine whether this is a case of Wells Fargo steering certain demographic groups to higher interest rates."
4393,"My car was hit & run by another car. I made a claim with XXXX, my insurance company. XXXX made a reservation with XXXX, their rental car partner. I had to put a {$50.00} deposit down on my credit card for the return of the car. The car was returned after repairs to my card were made. 

In the process, XXXX has gone wild charging my credit card numerous times even though XXXX was also paying them! 

Despite my supplying Wells Fargo Visa with the evidence of XXXX paying the amount that should have been charged, there are still unauthorized XXXX  charged on my Wells Fargo Visa. 

Please help. I have spent a total of 8 hours of wait time simply holding for XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who is also waiting on XXXX XXXX to pick up the phone. I have tried leaving messages for Senior Vice President XXXX XXXX XXXX with no returned call or email."
4394,"On XX/XX/2021 I made a purchase to XXXX for {$39.00}. The item I received was not the item I ordered, more of a cheap knock-off. I contacted the merchant several times to return the item, they would never give me the information to return the item. I then disputed the charge with my Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX card. I sent several correspondences to Wells Fargo that I had with the merchant. Showing how they would not respond to my returning of the item. The credit card company incompetently handled this dispute. The merchant told them I could return it, but I was never given that information. They did not investigate this dispute thoroughly."
4397,"I told the lady I was filing a complaint and she almost laughed over the phone at me because I was asserting my rights. All I was trying to buy was a {$350.00} futon. I get more than enough XXXX to afford it but Im trying to repair my credit. According to the email they sent me I was denied for insufficient income/Low income. According to the FTC website they can not knowingly and willingly deny me credit since my income is guaranteed and it comes from XXXX payments. 

The FTC website also states I can pursue a cause against the company in federal district court for a claim of discrimination and recover punitive damages. I am thinking seriously about it. If theyve done it to me theyve done it to someone else. A violation of this matter the s also a possibility violation of civil rights. For everyones information : to bring a suit in federal district court you need to ask for at least {$75000.00} in damages. 

Regardless how this turns out I will write a notice on XXXX review and XXXX warning them to stay away at all costs. That you must need to make {$50000.00} to be able to buy from there apparently. The poor and medically XXXX arent wanted."
4400,"I purchased furniture from XXXX in XXXX. They did not send the furniture complete. 
Said the parts would come in XXXX. I never received the bill and it caused me to go late on the report. I returned and got my money back and my late fees back but the late payment history is still my report."
4404,"I applied for a wells fargo credit card, they attempted to do a fraudulent transaction that I immediately said was not mine on XX/XX/19 call was recorded they can review that call. Wells Fargo issues me a new card and assures me that the transaction did not go through but then doesn't approve my claim because they say I activated the card and that I made this purchase. I did not receive the card nor did I activate it, if they would like I can send them my call log for the month and day so they can see I did not activate the card with my phone number. I was nowhere near the place where these theives were attempting to use my card so Wellsfargo denied my claim and want to hold me responsible for their charges {$610.00} worth. I am so upset and can't even imagine how they conduct investigations on claims and just blatantly lie about it and deny the claim. By lying I mean they said I called and activated the original card ending in XXXX again that's impossible. Have them call the location and request video footage whatever they need to do.I did not use this card for a {$610.00} purchase at XXXX."
4405,On XX/XX/XXXX my bill did not go through account with 1 missed payment. I am kindly requesting WELLS FARGO FINANCIA ( Opened XX/XX/XXXX ) to remove this missed payment from my credit reports as a gesture of goodwill. Doing so would sincerely be appreciated and represent an invaluable gift to my family and me.
4406,"XX/XX/XXXX I used my Wells Fargo credit card "" points '' to purchase skin cream from the Wells Fargo website. I paid {$6.00} and {$4.00} for shipping. 

XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of {$180.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX There was an unauthorized charge on my credit card from the same skin cream company for {$98.00}, but I did not know about it until later. 

XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of {$100.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX I discovered the fraud, reported it to Wells Fargo over the phone and closed the account. I was told that the payment I just made would leave my account with a positive balance after the fraudulent charge was reimbursed, so the difference would be deposited into my checking account. I immediately lost online access to this account. I DID NOT ASK FOR ANOTHER CARD TO BE MAILED TO ME! When the rep suggested this, I SAID ABSOLUTELY NOT, I WANT THE ACCOUNT CLOSED COMPLETELY. 

The account was NOT closed. Instead, I was issued another card, which I DID NOT RECEIVE, HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF IT, and had no access to the new account through online banking. I didn't even know I had an account at all until I started getting letters in the mail from Wells Fargo about late payments. 

The new credit card account was opened with a different account number, and I never saw a statement, not in the mail or online, until XX/XX/XXXX, after several requests. Twice I was told that no one had access to those statements anymore since the account was now closed. 

XX/XX/XXXX The same skin cream company charged the NEW credit card {$97.00} the same night I closed my account, and the bank refunded {$97.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX The skin cream company charged another {$97.00} and the bank refunded {$98.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX The skin cream company charged another {$97.00} and they refunded {$97.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX -- XX/XX/XXXX Automatic recurring charges that I had set up on my old credit card continued to be charged to the new account, without my knowledge, like XXXX and XXXX instant ink subscriptions. 

XX/XX/XXXX I got another letter from Wells Fargo saying that my account was past due with a balance of {$200.00} and I would be sent to collections. I immediately called Wells fargo. The rep told me he fixed everything. He reversed all the charges and interest up to that point, and again told me the account was closed now. He also said I would not be sent to collections. This was not true. I had already been reported to the credit bureau for missed payments on a closed account. 

Over the months from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I had at least 5 long phone and 2 in-person conversations with Wells Fargo employees about this matter. Each time, I was assured the problem was resolved and I had nothing more to worry about. Each time, I asked for a letter stating that I was not at fault and that Wells Fargo remove the bad marks on my credit report. Every employee told me the same thing- this would have to go through another department who would get back to me. I eventually was given the number to the dispute resolution department. They could not handle my request, either. 

XXXX XXXX I was finally able to file a dispute with the executive department who said they would have a resolution within 20 days. They did not. I tried numerous times to contact the person investigation my case, but without success. 

XX/XX/XXXX The bank reversed {$74.00} in late fees and charged me {$37.00} in late fees. 

XXXX XXXX The investigator finally called to tell me that I was wrong, I really owe all the money they say I owe, and they won't correct my credit report. I disagreed with her decision and asked how to appeal it. She said she'd reopen the case and have a resolution within 20 days. She did not. 

XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo sent me a letter that said they're sticking to their decision, they did nothing wrong, I owe them all the money, and my credit report is accurate as far as they are concerned. They also FINALLY sent me the statements for the account. 

Meanwhile, during this entire process, Wells Fargo has reported 10 missed payments on my credit report, even while I was disputing the charges. This is illegal. It says right on every statement, "" While we investigate, we can not report you as delinquent or take action to collect the alleged error amount. '' And they continue to charge me ever-increasing interest and late fees every month. They are accumulating and currently up to {$320.00}. 

Wells Fargo has now closed my other credit card account that I had with them, without even notifying me. I paid off the entire card, then tried to use it and it wouldn't work. The online banking just says, "" this account is closed. '' No explanation or letters or anything. 
Also, because of Wells Fargo 's illegal and incorrect information on my credit report ( and these are the ONLY negative marks WHATSOEVER ), my credit score has dropped by more than 200 points. All of my other credit cards have lowered my limits to whatever I owe on the cards or just closed my accounts if I didn't owe anything. This also raised my utilization ratio to 100 %, further lowering my credit score. I can not get an apartment, a car, a sofa, a job ... NOTHING! My life has been destroyed because of the incompetence and negligence of Wells Fargo. 

I have a gone over the statements thoroughly many times. I know I am right. The unauthorized purchases totalled {$430.00}, which was all reimbursed to me eventually. My purchases and deposits totalled {$85.00}. The bank charged me a total of {$230.00} in late fees and interest that I was NOT responsible for. WELLS FARGO STILL OWES ME {$150.00}!"
4410,"I initiated a dispute with Wells Fargo last year for a purchase I made overseas and the bank refused to honor my dispute. Instead I was sent a letter on XX/XX/2020 stating the dispute was declined for "" not as described food and services ''. No further explanation was given and their explanation is misleading and deceptive. I provided all the paperwork as asked and many times the bank made an error where a rep closed my dispute by mistake and I had to reopen dispute again. I was never notified of when my dispute was closed but i only came to find out when calling their bank. I Also at times the bank seemed to have lost my paperwork and made me resend again. Other times my dispute was not reopened when i requested to have it reopened. i want to know why they closed my dispute and to provide a detailed explanation. I have submitted all documentation asked over the months to support my dispute but still my dispute was closed without a valid reason. If this kind of deceptive customer service continues from Wells Fargo I have no other choice but to close my accounts. In the past they have been guilty of opening accounts without customers permission and they paid a big penalty and now they are doing it again by not resolving disputes and not following the proper guidelines. They openning accounts but they don't want to do the work and resolve anything for the client such as disputes. They just want numbers. I want a bank and credit card that will work for me and not a bank that I will be working for them!! So far Wells Fargo is lagging behind as a reputable bank and I wanted to give it a try but they have let me down. I have included some paperwork as support to my claim."

I checked my credit report and see there was a "" soft inquiry '' made by Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2021. I did not get an alert from the credit company because it was not a hard inquiry. 

I believe Wells Fargo knowingly reopened an old account without my permission. This is an unauthorized account. I called Wells Fargo and closed it but was on hold for 60 minutes before I spoke to someone and we were mysteriously disconnected before we were finished. I am thoroughly alarmed by Wells Fargo.

They charged me a {$38.00} late fee and a {$1.00} minimum interest charge for a number of months. They initially waived some of the payment fees because they saw that I was making larger than expected payments and the payments were made before the payment was acutally due. They now tell me that I can not pay the amount early since their "" system doesn't handle payments that way ''. I believe in the State of Wisconsin a bank can not charge for paying EARLY. I view this charge of a late fee and interest charge as a fee charged because I prepaid this account. No one at Wells Fargo seems to understand that. I will attach copies of two bills showing the late fee and minimum interest charge. I have a spreadsheet of payments I've made to Wells Fargo since the middle of 2020. I want Wells Fargo to REFUND ALL fees charged to my account, report my payment history as such, and comply with the law in the State of Wisconsin."

4427,"Below is the email I sent to resolve a situation that resulted in a late payment credit hit and documents unusual and extra-ordinary lengths I needed to go through to submit a payment online to Wells Fargo. My late payment is not a reflection of my ability and pattern of on-time payments, but a fault in their online system. Despite the evidence provided, Wells Fargo refused to correct my credit report. I've also attached a pdf that has the screenshots attached. 

From XXXX XXXX Case # : XXXX Purpose of Email : Provide evidence that my late payment should be removed from the credit reporting agencies. 

Hi XXXX, Thank you for talking with me today and hearing my concerns and providing a way for me to provide evidence ( I've provided screenshots below ) and testimony regarding the late payment on my Wells Fargo account and reported as such to the credit bureaus. 

Now I will briefly explain why, and backed by evidence and logic, it would be just and fair to remove the late payment report from my credit report. 
Due to no fault of my own, I've been required to take extraordinary steps to make prompt on-time payments, such that I have not had to do with any other bank for the 15+ years I have been making credit or loan payments. 

As I've said, this was not due to any fault of my own, but is due to the technical barriers, caused by the design and function of Wells Fargo website, which hindered my ability to setup an account using autopay through a monthly transfer from my XXXX XXXX Checking account. 

When attempting to setup the account I received the error messages "" we are unable to add this account because it is not valid for bank-to-bank transfers and payments '' and "" We're sorry, your transfer can not be completed at this time, please try again later. '' I believed as the second message indicated, that this was a temporary issues with Wells Fargo, and not an issue that I could resolve. As such, in order to make payments, I did so over the phone. However, over several months, I continued to have issues, and so continued to make payments over the phone. which the bank records and computer forensic evidence would show. These are the extraordinary steps that I took to make my payments on-time because the Wells Fargo system prevented me from adding my account. 

Was there something wrong with my non-wells Fargo account that, that was my responsibility to correct? No, I fulfilled my responsibility by having my XXXX XXXX Checking Account setup correctly. The evidence of my claim? I used this same account to make payments over the phone, ( had I been given the opportunity I would have setup payments for autopay through the phone as well, but due to the limitations of your system, I could not make more than 2 advance payments ). 

Additional proof that my XXXX XXXX Checking account was setup sufficiently to make automatic payments, is that I have this same account setup to pay several other creditors. If needed, I can provide evidence of this as well. 

As I've laid out, out-of-the ordinary steps where taken to be prompt in my payments to Wells Fargo. And when I saw that I was late on my payment, which I did not realize, until after seeing it on my credit report, I immediately made an over-the-phone payment, and contacted Wells Fargo to rectify the situation. 

As the purpose of credit reports are to accurately report my credit situation, including my future ability, and past consistency in making on-time debt payments, and is the primary tool for potential lenders to determine my creditworthiness, I think that is only fair and just, and indeed in the best interest of the credit bureaus, creditors, and others in the credit industry that my credit report accurately reflect that I do indeed make my payments on-time. 

As, laid out above, the late payment that occurred recently is not reflective of my creditworthiness, but reflective of fixes that need made to Wells Fargo 's financial website. Therefore, I ask that Wells Fargo make a request to the credit bureaus, to remove "" late payment '' that was added to my account, for the reasons indicated above, and so that my creditworthiness is more accurately reflected. 

Thanks for your time and customer service,"
4428,"I am writing today in regards to my account with WF CRD SVC account # XXXX. The reason for writing today is in regards to the late payment is which is showing on my report in XX/XX/2020, due to Covid I was unable to make the payment in XX/XX/2020. As soon as I was able to, I got my payment made and caught up."
4429,"I had a fence put in XX/XX/2017 and was told there would be a 24 month deferred no interest, I got my bill and saw it was only 6 months, I called Wells fargo several times and they told me the agreement was with the fence company not wells fargo, yet I am paying wells fargo credit card. I have been paying every 2 weeks and now they have put a XXXX interest rate on my card on the XX/XX/XXXX statement."
4431,"On XX/XX/XXXX, received a letter stating there was a balance transfer of {$2700.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX, a second letter stating another balance transfer of {$2000.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX.I called immediately, Wells Fargo cancelled my card and reissued with a new number. I was told the claim would take 15 to 30 days. Called them on XXXX, they said they would open a claim, called on XXXX, told the claim wasn't filed on XXXX promised a letter in 7 to 10 days, called on XXXX now it will take 30 to 45. Told my name or Social # was linked to these two account. Told to check with the two other banks, I have called both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, they both said that my name and Social # are not linked to these account. Wells Fargo told me to get written proof from these banks. I faxed the request to both bank. Both banks have told me this isn't the way things are handled. I faxed requests to both banks. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX called, we got on a conference call with Wells Fargo to confirm my namer is not linked. Wells Fargo said that they would open another claim. I have a letter, which was emailed to me, dated XXXX, saying a claim was opened and should take 15 to 20 days. On the XXXX phone call Wells Fargo said the claim was denied on XXXX. One person at Wells Fargo said they would open a claim for me, investigate and then just deny it."
4440,"On XX/XX/XXXX I called to report that my purse had been stolen 2 days prior. When I spoke to the representative through Wells Fargo Services, I was advised that I would not be held accountable for any transactions made on my account. At the time I called, I was asked if I had made any recent transactions. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was also advised an amount on my card for {$2100.00} was pending and the amount was adjusted and removed. The first card was closed and a new card was issued with a {$0.00} balance. I was sent a letter by the dispute department l, which I signed and dated confirming I did not authorize any charges. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from the dispute department stating this was a valid charge and my name and address matched for the transaction. I called immediately and spoke to card services again. The agent was rude and kept stating he could not help me and offered a fax number. I requested to speak to a Supervisor and she confirmed they had no notes on my file stating my purse was stolen along with my SS security number, driver 's licence, contact info such as phone number, email, etc. I always carry this type of information in my planner and wallet."
4442,"Wells Fargo, who has already admitted to opening TWO fake accounts in our family members names, recently sent me TWO new debit cards in my name. These cards were not requested, and they are separate accounts from each other and seperate accounts from our personal accounts. These came in seperate mailings, and are further evidence of FRAUD of this bank. We recently bought a home, and we believe that these 2 additional credit cards may have affected our credit score negatively, causing us to have a higher interest rate. My husband and I are furious and disgusted with this bank, and need the authorities to stand up to this fraudulent institution."
4444,I have been double billed for a transaction at XXXX XXXX from XXXX. I explained to my credit card company that I was not there during those dates and provided the necessary proof to no avail.
4447,"In XX/XX/2009, I was XXXX and graduated high school. My mom took me to get a credit card from Wells Fargo Bank on XX/XX/2009, I was approved for a {$400.00} credit limit, but no-one explained to me how to use it I was just told don't max it out. I was very young and had no idea what credit even was. My mother was taking me out to dinner to celebrate and we discovered we had a flat tire along the way, we used all the money we had including my credit card to buy a new tire. The only money we had left to eat was the remaining balance of less than {$200.00} on my credit card so I fed myself, my mother, and my XXXX  siblings. I can't get another unsecured card because of this and I feel like I'm being punished for my lack of knowledge on how to use a credit card at XXXX. I'm XXXX now and I know how to be responsible with credit cards and I have a secured card now with a {$200.00} limit with XXXX but I need more credit because I take care of my sick father and a {$200.00} limit isn't enough for me to take care of him, and my household."
4453,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I got caught in a timeshare fraud while in XXXX. I charged about {$7500.00} on two cards. One was {$3500.00} to my Wells Fargo Visa card which they retuned to me but the {$3900.00} on my Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX card was rejected. Four days after I signed the contract on XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed the company and said I didn't want it. I again emailed the company on XX/XX/XXXX. I informed the credit card companies on that date also. The WF XXXX denied my request, saying I did not follow the directions on the contract to cancel in writing not email. I involved the Mn attorney general and they did what they could, including sending a letter to the address I had for the timeshare company but it was returned with no known address. The MN ag has had no luck with WF XXXX. They suggested I contact you. Thanks for any help you can give me. I no longer have the card."
4456,"Wells Fargo has a policy that allows you to only make a limited number of payments to a credit card from non-Wells Fargo accounts using their online banking system. 

This is a problematic policy for a few reasons : 1 ) Its strongly encouraging you to use additional Wells Fargo products that you may not need or want 2 ) There is a risk that you could have unnecessary interest applied to your account because you were prevented from paying off a balance 3 ) There isnt a risk to Wells Fargo for allowing more than the limited number of payments. The transaction clears the the ACH and should have any cost to Wells Fargo. 

In conclusion this is another predatory policy Wells Fargo has put in place that is harmful to its customers."
4457,"In XX/XX/2017 I obtained a secured credit card from Wells Fargo, paying an initial deposit of {$300.00}. I was told by the branch manager in XXXX, Oregon that after 1 year of making on time payments, that my security deposit would be refunded and my card would be converted to an unsecured card and my deposit refunded and credited to my checking account. It has been 2 full years now since I have had the secured card. I have never missed or been late on a single payment. I have always paid more than my minimum payment as well. 
I tried to resolve this after the first year, and was advised that they do not automatically convert the card to a secured card ; they said they review the card periodically and then decide to convert it or not. The security deposit is also "" non interest bearing '' as well, meaning they are making money off my deposit and not giving me any of the interest earned. All they did was waive the new annual fee of {$25.00}."
4463,"I contacted  Wells Fargo Bank  on the   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    , and asked that my Secured Card account be closed, and that the collateral money  ( {$500.00} ) be t ransferred to my checking account within the same banking system.

I checked my checking account on the   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , and noticed there were no changes. I called the banks headquarters in   XXXX   XXXX  , and was told that they were going to handle my financial affairs for 60 days."
4470,"I did a balance transfer from 1 credit card company to wells Fargo. The terms of the balance transfer for Wells Fargo were 0.00 % interest for the term of the balance transfer which means I would not have to make any payments whatsoever. Now, without any notification or changes to our agreement, Wells Fargo is making me pay monthly payments on this balance transfer. This is a BREACH OF CONTRACT, and should be considered illegal."
4472,"XX/XX/2021 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Florida XXXX Wells Fargo XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX Re : Account number : XXXX To Whom It May Concern, This letter is a formal dispute and request to remove late payments from my credit report. The information is incorrect, untrue, and the laws pertaining to furnishers reporting late payments is quite clear. I have outlined it below : Section 623 ( a ) ( 7 ) requires a financial institution that regularly reports negative information to nationwide CRAs to provide one clear and conspicuous written notice of that practice to consumers, no later than 30 days after first reporting such information. My research has found this notice is typically found on monthly statements, however : 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 - Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies ( 7 ) Negative information ( E ) Use of notice without submitting negative information No provision of this paragraph shall be construed as requiring a financial institution that has provided a customer with a notice described in subparagraph ( A ) to furnish negative information about the customer to a consumer reporting agency.

Additionally, FTC Advisory Opinion to Harris ( 03-22-99 ) states : "" Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA addresses the duty to correct and update information by "" furnishers, '' or persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( "" CRA '' ) such as credit bureaus. This opinion goes on to address the reporting of late payments stating this provision requires a furnisher to provide corrected or updated information to the consumer reporting agency that it had reported to originally regardless of whether they were accurate at one point, because the section requires the furnisher both to "" update '' accounts as well as to "" correct.As you can see the law and FTC opinion state that you, the furnisher, are NOT legally bound to report negative information. Please refrain from continuing to report the late payments on my credit reports. The account is current, and thus, you have a duty to correct and update the negative reporting of late payments.

This was supposed to be resolved. fast forward to Wells Fargo banking, I was issued a temp credit for {$190.00} Then it was taken away, then put on as a credit then taken away. I was told via email that the bank was on my side, bank tellers promised me credit will stay on and today {$190.00} was taken from my account again and I was told by Wells Fargo XXXX, that visa refused and bank is recharging me ; I feel cheated, lied to, and victimized by my bank and this unscrupulous vendor."
4479,"I had subscribed to an online computer support company for more than a year, they are called XXXX XXXX XXXX. My contact there is only known to me as someone named XXXX. He has contacted me on at least 2 different phone numbers XXXX and XXXX. I think they might be based in another country but am not positive. They offer software to speed up your computer and virus/ malware protection. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX from their company called me to let me know they would be giving me a refund because their software was not working properly. He called me the next morning on XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX XXXX  to let me know they were going to deposit {$460.00} into my account with XXXX  XXXX XXXX. 

I have online banking and I made the mistake of allowing him to access my computer with their software at this time. He said he was just going to do a Direct deposit while I was watching, but first did a preliminary deposit of {$100.00} dollars for some reason. There was then computer glitch, lag or something he said, the decimal point moved and the deposit became XXXX dollars instead of XXXX .... then this happened again on the screen they apparently deposited {$20000.00} dollars into my account and I was pretty shocked. The guy ( XXXX ) panicked and said he was going to lose his job etc.. and that I needed to refund this to his company. To make a long story shorter, he gave me these two Wells Fargo account numbers along with names ( a supervisor ) that I was to deposit the excess money into after I withdrew it from my account that same day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) He had me deposit one amount of {$9500.00} and {$9000.00} into two separate accounts at Wells Fargo which I did for them that same day, thinking that it was their money. Strangely later that day, he called me asking me to destroy the papers which i wrote the account information on and the Wells Fargo Deposit slips.. he gave me some reasons for doing so, and I started to but I stopped and I still have them in my possession. He then advised me to leave my computer turned off all night until the next day because supposedly he said my computer was being hacked. The next day he wanted to contact me again so I could deposit the rest of the money to them, minus my refund. 

The next morning of the XX/XX/XXXX, I woke up early, thinking about everything, I checked my online banking at XXXX XXXX XXXX with my phone and saw that my XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card had an extra XXXX dollars on it. Immediately I went to my XXXX XXXX  XXXX branch to talk to a manager.. during that time and the next two hours, XXXX called my phone non-stop but I refused to answer. The Manager at XXXX XXXX XXXX checked their internal system and said that a cash advance was taken from my Card into my own checking account. Immediately then I was sure of what happened. I was led to believe that it was an external deposit into my account but it was my own money from my card that I had deposited into the Wells fargo accounts for a total of {$18000.00}. 

Afterwards I went to make a police report at my local Sheriffs ' dept. but after waiting quite a while, they told me they do n't do paper reports for that type of thing, so I completed one online. I later went to Wells Fargo to give them the account numbers and deposit slips and one of the  managers submitted the information to one of their departments, though, because I had started to tear up the papers previously, I did not have part of one of the account holders names, until i went back home and found the other piece. I re-submitted that to Wells fargo the following Monday morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and I spoke to the same manager and she was pretty helpful. 

Meanwhile I faxed a copy of the police report and a copy of an 'Identity Theft Victim 's Complaint and Affidavit ' and also photo copies of the Wells fargo accounts and deposit slips - on XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX  's fraud division. 

I have been trying to follow up on this and so far I am hearing from XXXX XXXX XXXX that I will still owe them the {$20000.00} dollars and Wells Fargo will not hear my case directly because I am a third party to the accounts, and they will not give me any information. there has been a more recent development though. 

Today XX/XX/XXXX, The guy who scammed me "" XXXX '' called me again. he had been attempting to call me, I believe because he probably wanted to get me to deposit the rest of the money he claimed I owed them and most likely try to do more damage, SO, because I had submitted the account information to Wells Fargo, i wanted to give them more time to possibly put a hold on those accounts, before XXXX figured out that I was on to the scam. When he called me a few days ago i told him I was in an accident and in the hospital and could n't talk. 
Today, when he called back I told him the same thing. I said I was in a motorcycle accident and might get out next week.THIS time though, he was upset angry and asked me if I did anything with the bank because he said they could not get the money out of those accounts, he was panicking and tried to ask me a lot of questions.. even offered to pay my hospital bill! I said I was on medication and couldnt talk. ( as I am trying to still not let on I know anything as long as possible ) This tells me that Wells fargo HAS put a hold on those accounts that contain my money from my credit card. Unfortunately though, I have no legal basis at this time or I dont know how to communicate with Wells Fargo about the fact I deposited my money into those accounts under a false belief it was not my own."
4480,"Had a Wells Fargo Credit Card for several years always in good standing. 
My Credit Limit was XXXX and as stated an older account with XXXX balance. With no warning they closed my account. 
For several stupid reasons ... .everyone I talked too was different. 
This had an adverse affect on my credit score! 
I have found this to be common practice and needs to be addressed."
4484,I never opened acccount Wells Fargo attempting to get money from me on something never opened.
4485,"I was a Wells Fargo customer for over 15 years with a checking and savings account, and for a slightly lesser time a credit card. About a year ago, I closed my Wells Fargo checking and savings, due to holds on deposits and blocks on my debit card for no justifiable reason, in addition to constant high pressure sales for more accounts, and consistent news regarding their unsavory business practices. For several months after closing my deposit accounts, I continued making regular payments to my Wells Fargo credit card from my other bank checking account. There was never a returned payment, and never a late payment. Suddenly and without warning or reason, about 2 months ago Wells Fargo started placing long holds on my payments made to the card. The first hold, I called customer service and was transferred a couple of times, before being told that the department that handles those holds is not "" customer facing '' and the only option for contact was to request an email be sent from them that I could respond to. So, I went forward with that process and spent about a half a day before I was able to have the hold removed. I have now had to repeat that process several times - with even a 'test ' payment I made of {$100.00} being held, as well as any larger payments I've made. The department handling the holds or release of holds is not open for the same extended hours that general customer service is, so twice now I've called, been placed on hold, been transferred twice ... only to be told that the department is closed and I'd have to call back the next day. I have asked why this is happening and have not received an answer. I have asked how to avoid this on EVERY single payment I make, and not received an answer. Last week, I applied a payment to the card that would clear the balance to XXXX - while I don't wish to close the card, due to the long positive history I have with it being necessary to maintain my credit rating, I was so tired of being bullied into opening another Wells Fargo account just to have this stop happening. As it stands, I made that payment on Friday, it was "" processed '' by Wells Fargo and cleared my other bank checking on Monday, and as of today the payment is still being held. I called this morning and after two transfers, the 3rd person I talked to suggested that it was the size of the payment causing the issue. I argued that they'd even held a {$100.00} payment when I was testing things out. She then suggested it was due to the outside bank being the source ( even though my payments have been coming from that same account without issue for months ) and made reference to a Wells Fargo checking, as many before her have done. Wells Fargo continues to bully their customers, operate in a way that causes undue inconvenience, and proceed with a course of action that they only get away with due to their size."
4487,"I disputed a transaction on XX/XX/XXXX with WELLS FARGO for the charge of {$780.00} from a merchant : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. WELLS FARGO mishandled the dispute case and failed to refund the disputed claimed amount that was filed because of the poor service provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX incorrectly diagnosed and suggested that water-heater at our house needs replacement. As we have home-warranty from a company name XXXX, they covered the Water-heater cost, but XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) said there are extra cost of {$780.00} for pipes, valves, city code charges and side items. We agreed to get the job done and pay extra cost of {$780.00}, and appointment was scheduled on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX CT. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX ( plumber ) from XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   arrived at our house and replaced the water-heater, my wife signed the paper after the job completed. We thought we would get hot water that day but didn't happened. Next day, my wife called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   and XXXX ( plumber ) said wait for a day and see if it works. We waited for two days and still didn't get hot water. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX ( plumber ) from XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX came at our house, researched the water-heater and piping in the basement and find out that water-heater was not the problem. XXXX diagnosed the problem ; hot and cold water was mixing inside the basement bathroom wall due to previously installed pipes in the bathroom. XXXX, with his apologetic and sincere voice said the truth and accept the fact that first plumber XXXX misdiagnosed the problem, the water-heater didn't needed replacement. 

We did not open the wall to fix the pipes because that was a big job but XXXX was nice to put a value outside the bathroom ceiling and disconnected water supply in the basement bathroom, so the water don't get mixed and the rest of the house gets hot water, a temporary fix. 

I called XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and talk to the owner but he was extremely rudely said he can not help us, and screamingly hung up the call. 

I disputed the transaction of {$780.00} with WELLS FARGO and the case processor investigated the case absolutely incorrectly. I am disputing 'the poor service ' provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and WELLS FARGO processor disputed a case as a problem with 'merchandise ' ; and rejected the claim based on the paper work provided by XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that they installed the water-heater and other material. 

This is simply a poor service provided by a plumbing company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, they suggested to change a water-heater that was not supposed to be replaced. According to WELLS FARGO and VISA customer agreement, WELLS FARGO should fight to get the money back from merchant as we paid for something we didn't needed."
4495,I recently attempted to enter the bank 's website and it wants to send a code to a U.S. cell phone and I'm currently traveling Internationally. I tried to call the customer service number and spoke with a rep that asked five minutes of identity questions and then wanted to transfer me again and I gave up. The first two questions should have been enough. I've been a customer for 35 years with a high credit limit and I explained all I wanted was to know what my balance was to pay the monthly payment. What I got was harassment in my opinion.
4496,"This is a problem I seem to be having more and more frequently when using a credit or debit card. I make a purchase, for some reason am not satisfied with the item purchased, return it, receive a credit, and then have to wait an undefined number of days for the credit to appear on my account. This, of course, affects the status of my account and balance in real time. I simply do not understand why charges appear on a credit card or debit card account immediately, but credits take an undefined number of days -- sometimes more than a week -- to appear on the account. The retailer claims the fault is the bank administering the credit or debit card, and the bank claims they can not issue a credit until they receive it from the retailer. This makes no sense since both purchases and credits are done electronically and should occur immediately, as purchases currently do. 

Another illustration of this dilemma is the "" holding '' fees hotels and car rental companies are now imposing on credit or debit cards. As recently as last year, I would make a reservation at a hotel with a credit or debit card to hold the reservation, arrive, complete my stay, and pay my bill on departure. There never was any so-called "" holding '' fee. The same was true for car rentals. Now both hotels and car rental companies are imposing "" holding '' fees on reservations and rentals and supposedly "" returning '' those holding fees at the end of the hotel stay or the car rental. The problem is the money is NOT returned immediately, is HELD for an unspecified number of days, and the account is left in a sort of limbo until the money is returned or credited back to the account. 

This imposes real time costs on the status and balance of an account, affecting a credit or debit card holder 's ability to use his credit or debit card. 

The credit card at issue in my case is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Master Card and the debit card is the VISA card linked to my Wells Fargo checking account, but I suspect that this new practice is being used by credit and debit card issuers across the board. 

Please look into the legality of this practice, which allows, in the case of a debit card, the issuer to hold on to a customer 's own deposited checking account money, and deprive the customer of the use of that money for an unspecified amount of time."
4499,"I opened a XXXXXXXX XXXX Credit Card in XX/XX/XXXX. The due date for payment is on the XXXX of each month. Subsequently, a few months into payment, I contacted XXXX XXXX Customer Service, @ ( XXXX ) to change my due date from the XXXX of each month, until the XXXX. This plea fell on "" deaf ears! '' I continued calling, to no avail! 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with a Customer Service Representative, by the name of XXXX, and he reassured me that my due date would be changed in XX/XX/XXXX, to the XXXX of each month. This still did not materialize, and I was frustrated to say the least. No payment was made. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXXXXXX XXXX  again, explaining my frustration, and was transferred, to the Executive Office. I spoke to XXXX, in the Executive VP Office. I apprised her of the situation. She informed me to not make any payments, etc. until all issues were researched and investigated pertaining to my account. She stated she would assign my case to an Analyst, XXXX XXXX, and he would contact me in 10 business days. I was given a Complaint Case # XXXX. I was never contacted by XXXX XXXX. I contacted the Executive Business Office, in 10 business days instead! 

The case was assigned to XXXX XXXX, in The Executive Office. I explained my frustrations and plight. He indicated he would analyze the case, and call me back. He later contacted me, and stated he adjusted late fees on my account. He NEVER addressed changing my due date. I requested to speak to his Supervisor. 

I spoke to XXXXXXXX XXXX  Supervisor, XXXX, and the issue was NOT resolved. I requested to escalate my case. I spoke to XXXXXXXX XXXX Supervisor, XXXX, who stated he would listen to previous phone calls, pertaining to my request, to change my due date from the XXXX to the XXXX. He contacted me later in the week, and stated, he had listened to my phone calls, regarding my request to change the monthly due date. He further stated, I acquiesced to the XXXX of each month. I told him, I made this plea several times, to NO AVAIL! He did not indicate the due date would be changed. I also addressed the 30 day late derogatory credit reporting to all bureaus regarding my credit history. This was reported to all Credit Bureau agencies, in XX/XX/XXXX! XXXX stated, Wells Fargo was within their right, to report the 30 day late delinquency! I VEHEMENTLY disagreed, and concluded the phone call.. 

Subsequently, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received correspondence, dated XX/XX/XXXX, from XXXXXXXX XXXX I was in UTTER SHOCK, to learn, my XXXX XXXX Credit Card was closed! I immediately contacted The Executive Office, and was informed XXXX XXXX, would contact me about this matter. XXXX XXXX, has FAILED to contact me about the matter. XXXX XXXX did not contact me via telephone, as promised, regarding the closure of my XXXXXXXX XXXX account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from Collections. I lamented to Collections. I was awaiting a phone call regarding my account from XXXX XXXX, in The Executive Office. The Collections Department, knew nothing of such, and said that my account had been transferred to their department. I immediately hung up from the Collections department, and contacted The Executive Office, and again lamented, how I have been CONSISTENTLY and UNFAIRLY treated by Wells Fargo in the The Executive Office. 

I spoke to XXXX in the The Executive Office, and he apologized profusely, for what I had experienced regarding my XXXXXXXX XXXX Credit Account. He stated he would assign the case to another analyst, XXXX XXXX. Case # XXXX. He indicated phone number XXXX, ext. XXXX was the phone number to follow up. He further stated, I would be contacted in 10 business days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXXXXXX XXXX Collections Department, and spoke to XXXX, Manager in the Collections Department. I apprised her, of my frustrations, and the closure of my account. XXXX apologized, and stated since The Executive Office, is closed on the weekend, and my account was assigned, to The Executive Office, she could not re-open my account. 

XXXX further stated, per review of my account, since The Executive Office had my account assigned to one of the Analyst in XXXX, my account should not have been closed by the Collections Department. A hold should have been placed on my account! The Executive Office, FAILED to communicate this to Collections. As the facts and evidence entail, I was SEVERELY FAILED by Wells Fargo Executive Office.

I am asking that the following take place : My Account should be reopened without any late fees. 
My Account Due Date should have been changed from the XXXX to the XXXX Remove any and ALL DEROGATORY Credit with the Reporting Agencies. 

I am requesting that Wells Fargo return me to whole, both on this XXXX 's Credit Card, and with the Reporting Agencies. All payments will be promptly made upon the correct balance and monthly due date changes! 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

4500,Direct deposit from federal government is still unavailable meanwhile Wells Fargo and XXXX are collecting interest and playing the blame game.
4503,Wells Fargo opened a credit card under my name which i never applied for. Wells Fargo charged my account fees for that credit card. Wells Fargo ruined my credit by opening a credit card and opening accounts under my name which were never authorized.

After that I made a copy of my social security card and send ( post office mail ) with the enclosed envelop from Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa Credit Card sending to me to ask me to provide them the copy of my social security card. Moreover, I am currently the customer of Wells Fargo Mortgage ( Please see attachment ). I do n't know why my social security number ca n't be verified."
4512,"I bank with Wells Fargo. I pay the minimum every month with auto pay. This month the auto pay switched to pay the fullbalance of card without my authorization on XXXX XXXX dollars was deducted from my account making my account over draft with many fees associated. Over {$3400.00} was taken from my checking and another XXXX taken from my savings. 
I now have a negative balance of {$870.00}. i am unable to pay other cards and gym memberships and my rent. I contacted Wells Fargo credit card on Sunday XX/XX/XXXX and was told the funds would be placed back in my checking account by Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX. ON XX/XX/XXXX i check and no funds were place back in checking and savings account. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and was given the run around and they said they did not take the funds, so i raised a dispute because no one could clearly tell me where the the funds from my checking and saving went."
4522,Applied for the card did n't know that they would run a hard inquiry on my credit report.
4523,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I was offered payment deferral assistance through the Wells Fargo app for the third time. I was provided legal disclosure ignore minimum payment notices, no late fees, etc. This was identical to previous offers, but I still screenshotted this just in case. On XX/XX/XXXX, my statement showed a late fee and I immediately opened a complaint. I was told there are only two rounds of payment assistance and it wasn't possible to have a third be offered. A week or so later after my initial complaint, about five or six weeks after the initial deferral in which I was told to stop paying, halfway through the second of two statement cycles that I was to defer, consumer lending wrote me a letter saying my application for deferral has been denied -- an application which does not exist in any form and is only offered to the customer as it was to me, and they said during my initial complaint and for every one of the four or five complaints I've filed in the six months since, that application can not exist because they do not offer it three times. They have never since acknowledged this letter in their dozen plus repetitions in telling me third payment deferals even as an application do not exist at all.

After hours of my time spent trying to get in contact, almost six weeks after I opened this initial case, in mid XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX, did I finally reach my case agent who reversed all late fees and promised if I gave a picture with screenshot of the legal disclosure from that day, that I would receive credit reporting relief. I sent that to her as we were on the phone. She responded shortly after saying there needed to be a date. Since this was an iPhone, the only thing you can do is bring up the date the picture was taken and include that in the screenshot as well, which I did on XXXX XXXX. I never heard back from her after this and she said she would respond if there was an issue, and I assume the reversal had taken place.

A few months later, this hasnt occurred. I opened another case, denied per usual, with the agent refusing to return my calls. I went into a branch and that first agent was reached by phone, and claimed I never asked about credit reporting. A new case was opened and sent to credit reporting. They concluded that they must report as it happened, as the customer paid as agreed. Only, we agreed to a payment deferral for two months through XXXX and XXXX, so this is wholly inaccurate. I complained further with WF two more times, as well as to the XXXX. Only once I got to the XXXX, received the same letter with the same reasoning that there is only two covid deferral assistance offers, and had the case reopened with the XXXX did I receive a call from a WF agent for the first time since XXXX. Even with about four complaints filed inbetween. She wrote they dont offer three rounds of assistance, and the photograph that I provided did not have a date ( previously not acknowledged as existing ) and they have no evidence that I was ever offered such a thing. She has refused to answer calls over two months since her letter. The second reviewing agent of the XXXX  complaint never returned any of my calls after making that first call I referred to above, and I finally received a letter from her which basically said that nothing they did on their end was incorrect and literally attached the XXXX letter from the first XXXX complaint. Which is all they've been doing, outside of the credit reporting agent XXXX - repeating the same thing over about how their policy is there can only be two, which was violated by them in making a third agreement with me, and that everything I said is made up. 

Ive never missed a late payment prior to that month in my history as a consumer. Wells Fargo plummeted my credit score by XXXX points due to their negligence and at this point, fraud. Please note I only have documents from after I went into the branch, and had the case open with the credit reporting department, I foolishly discarded the notices I was saving as I had taken the XXXX agent at her word this would be fixed. They refuse to give me these notices, or even acknowledge them, so hopefully you will have more luck than I. I have every notice since that branch visit in XXXX attached, as well as the XXXX bank statement that shows me making my payments to bring the account current ( by the XX/XX/XXXX due date per the agreement ) after receiving both interest and fee reversals on XX/XX/XXXX, and sending the attached email of the screenshot per the agent 's request immediately after on XX/XX/XXXX. 

To conclude, They gave me a third offer of covid payment deferral assistance, identical to the first two offers, and I have been fervently trying to resolve this issue since the moment I received the XXXX statement with late fee on XX/XX/XXXX. They are refusing to acknowledge the offer as existing, even with their consumer lending department doing just that, and refuse to acknowledge the dated screenshot I sent them as they requested in XXXX."
4526,Opened a card to pay XXXX bill for XXXX for my XXXX. Had my own card to pay with but XXXX  suggested Wells Fargo interest free for 6 months and did not need to start paying off balance immediately. Had trouble logging on and setting up online payments a few times and called to get help. Sent to multiple departments and disconnected 2 times. Finally told me I was in collections! Had no idea. Company sent me to collections because I was late 3 month of payments and I had no idea. Never called or emailed. Claimed they mailed a letter I did not receive. Then tole me I owed {$500.00} on a {$6000.00} cred balance to be removed from collections!!! I have a {$10000.00}. card I pay {$250.00} on. {$500.00} payment is outrageous. Asked to have my billing cycle start over so I can start making payments regularly because I was not aware I was 2 months behind as I never received notice. Then in formed me I had a retail card and was being charged multiple minimums at once?! Tried o call back again to resolve because I was working and person from collections was condescending while I was trying to restart cycle. Called another time ... woman was very nice but collections never answered and on hold over 20 minutes. She told me to call another time. Now I have negative marks on my credit due to them and this scam card and no resolution with their sending me to collections in 2 months without warning.
4527,"Wells Fargo allowed for a credit card to be opened in my name by someone who obtained my information as a result of identity theft.

All 3 of these companies are violating my rights and are refusing to remove this fraudulent account from my credit file and therefor they are violating my rights to good credit and are violating the FCRA Section 605 ( B ). I have sent certified letters to all 3 of these companies and they have continued to ignore me. This account is fraudulent and was opened as a result of identity theft."
4529,"On    XXXX   XXXX    , 2017 I  responded to promotion b y Wells Fargo,  in obtaining a  Visa  card from them.

In so doing, I also faxed them the PDF of the promotion, upon which I had obtained the credit card. Attached please find PDF of the promotion, to which I responded. and my letter to  W.F.    Apparently,  W.F. , was telling me that ( 1 ) instead of the {$200.00}, they wanted to pay me {$150.00} and apparently they wanted to defer the {$150.00} payment to   XXXX  2017   .   Soon after opening the account, it became clear to me that there was absence of integrity and banker 's mindset deeply rooted at  W.F.,  upon which I stopped using their credit card, altogether. Further, I probably shall commence legal action agains t W.  F.,  should they fail, in paying off the {$200.00} to me by   XXXX  2017   .   They are numerous other issues with W.F. Credit Card, such as their refusal in paying the rewards promised as percentage of your spending, as they demand to pay such rewards in {$25.00} or {$50.00} incriminates. As such you can not only redeem {$50.00} on a {$70.00} accumulated rewards."

Percent of credit accounts with late payments of 30 days or more 3 ). Bank card balances are too high relative to credit limit I had paid off my total balance on this credit card months ago. The first and third accusation are not true or accurate because of this. Also the second accusation is not true because I was never late on payments since my account was on autopay. When I called Wells Fargo credit card account services the representative told me the 30 or more late payments accusation had nothing to do with Wells Fargo. That in itself does not make any sense whatsoever. All she told me was that Wells Fargo had deemed my account too risky to keep open. 

I believe my credit score and report has suffered because of this closure."

4547,"In XX/XX/2021 I reported fraud on my credit card with Wells Fargo. My card number was reissued and I received a new card in the mail. Shortly after that I received convenience or "" super '' checks with a promotional offer of 0 % for either a year or 15 months. I decided to make use of one of those checks by depositing into my account ( not with Wells Fargo ) and wrote a few checks on the money in that account thinking nothing of it. Several days later I receive notice of overdraft and returned item fees relating to the check being counterfeit. I call my bank and explain that there's no way the check can be counterfeit because it's drawn on a credit line from Wells Fargo. They told me I needed to get in contact with Wells Fargo and I did. At my first point of contact I was told that the checks I'd received were attached to the old credit card and therefore unusable but that I shouldn't worry because it looked like the marketing department printed new checks for me and they would be sent shortly. After waiting for close to a month I called Wells Fargo back to let them know I'd never received the checks and to rehash the situation. It occurred to me during that call that when I received the previous checks AFTER receiving a new card that those checks were sent with no utility constituting deceptive advertising and a misleading offer. The reps that I spoke to acknowledged on a recorded line that this was indeed their mistake and that they apologize but have yet to correct this issue offering me only options that force me to open an account with them. This situation has not only had an impact on my time spent trying to get a resolution but also on my finances as I incurred an overdraft and returned item fee. I've asked several times for a manager-level employee to reach out to me, I've reached out via social media, and have been committed that not only were my concerns and time urgency documented but that someone would call me. I've never received one call. The only outreach done was a letter sent to my address telling me the very thing I learned within 15 minutes of my first call and that was that the checks I'd received were attached to the old account number and therefore not usable."

4579,"Wells Fargo Bank apparently is using nonfinancial, and probably illegally obtained and applied, data and criteria, to deny me a credit card, and is probably committing these illegal practices industry-wide. 

Despite telling that, by its own standards, it regarded me as an "" excellent '' credit risk, Wells Fargo, where I have banked for over 12 years, denied a credit card to me on the vague grounds of an unspecified ratio regarding credit bureau trades and number of revolving bankcards. Wells Fargo nonsensically offered my credit counseling to improve my credit score of XXXX out of 850 points. 

Despite asking for a re-evaluation and an EXPLANATION of what these vague bases meant and how they trumped by other excellent credit history over more than thirty years, and despite pointing out that there is absolutely no derogatory information in my credit report to even hint I could not or would not pay off its credit card, Wells Fargo has steadfastly maintained, without any further data or explanation, that it made the correct decision. This absolute refusal by Wells Fargo to explain how those two arbitrary, technical numbers have any relevance to my credit risk or ability to pay off its credit card, or how or why my otherwise spotless, decades old credit history is trumped by these unexlained numbers, and the bank 's stubborn insistence, without explanation that its decision was correct, leads inescapbably to the conclusion that Wells Fargo is using some unrevealed, and illegal, set of metrics, data or criteria in its lending decisions. 

I short, since there is no rational, explainable, financial reason for Wells Fargo 's decision, and since the bank refuses to even try to explain its decision, it obviously is concealing something in its decision process that it does not want the public or regulators to know. 

My initial application was in XX/XX/XXXX, application number XXXX. It was denied by letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, in which it was stated that by credit score was XXXX out of 850, but I could counseling to improve it! I asked for reconsideration XX/XX/XXXX, which was denied by a second letter on the same grounds. I had an online chat about XX/XX/XXXX with Wells Fargo, in which they could not or refused to explain their decision, and opened a complaint for me only after I threatened to withdraw my funds. That complaint resulted in a call from XXXX XXXX in the Executive Offices. She knew nothing about the reason for the denial, could not explain it, and could not fix it. She referred me to underwriting to talk to the underwriter responsible for personally reviewing my application and denying it a second time. I was not allowed to speak to that underwriter, however, and the person I did speak to in underwriting knew nothing about the reasons for denial and could not explain them. He opened a new complaint for me though (! ) which resulted in another call from the Executive Offices ( one "" XXXX '' ) who also knew nothing about the stated reasons for the denial and could not explain them. 

I continually was advised to contact the credit bureau which provided Wells Fargo with the excellent credit rating, with no explanation why I should do so or what I would complain to the credit bureau about. I eventually did so, and found absolutely nothing derogatory in my credit report. 

In the meantime, at the repeated urging of Wells Fargo, I arranged a meeting with a banker at my local office in XXXX, Washington. Just before that meeting, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received yet another communication from the Executive Offices, again standing by the decision to deny credit, and still refusing to provide any further explanation. At the meeting with my personal banker on XX/XX/XXXX, I found that he, too, knew nothing about the reasons for the denial and could not explain them. He tried to suggest the denial was based on my debt/income ration, but that is not and never has been Wells Fargo 's stated reason for denying me credit. He opened still another complaint for me, assuring me of a better response. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received still another letter from Wells Fargo, still obstinately refusing to explain its decision, but insisting it was correct. On XX/XX/XXXX, I wrote to XXXX XXXX XXXX, Senior Executive VPf for consumer lending, XXXX XXXX, Senior Executive VP and COO, and Wells Fargo 's Credit Card Services, demanding an explanation. I In response, I received still another letter from Wells Fargo 's Executive Offices, insisting, without explanation, that its unexplained denial was sound and correct and would not be changed. 

During this entire, up to this very moment, Wells Fargo itself says I have, by its own evaluation standards, "" Excellent '' credit. I even have a {$10000.00} credit line with the bank! 

It seems inescapable that Wells Fargo has an undisclosed reason for denying me a credit card. Its utterly intransigent refusal to explain it inexplicable basis for denial, and it insistence that it's unexplained and unjustifiable reasons are correct, simple prove that it has reasons it is not disclosing and does not want revealed to the public or to regulators. These reasons likely are illegal and inappropriate. Given Wells Fargo 's history of improper and illegal activity, this is not an unreasonable conclusion. 

Please keep in mind, I have no need of a Wells Fargo credit card. But I do have a need to a lawful, financially justifiable, rational basis and explanation for the denial. Wells Fargo simply, utterly refuses to explain its decision, and by that refusal plainly indicates it has made it decision on some improper and most likely illegal basis. It seems likely that it is making similar unlawful decisions, using undisclosed and illegal criteria and data, in all its lending practices."
4580,"To whom it may concern, I opened a secured credit card account at Wells Fargo a few months ago, and told the banker very clearly that I would do the autopay with my checking account from XXXX. She said no problem and asked me to open a saving account on Wells Fargo. After a lot of signature without further explanation from the banker, she said that I was all set. I was actually very happy at that time, did not know she linked my secured credit card with my saving account from Wells Fargo in which I do not have enough money to pay back. I did not realize it only after about a month. For sure, it gave me a lot inconvenience later. I spent hours on calling/writing them many times trying to ask for the feedback from Wells Fargo. They did not admit the fault they made, repeatedly showed me that my signature was on the document. However, I was never told the document was the autopay linked to my Wells Fargo saving account.

Thank you for listening.

Best regards,"
4582,"In XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to change banking institutions leaving Wells Fargo and going to XXXX. In order to change I needed to pay off three credit cards I secured a personal loan from XXXX for the exact payoff amount in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX then mailed the checks to the three receiving Credit Cards. I have a XXXX tracking number that proved that the check was received on XX/XX/XXXX. I waited a couple of weeks, the XXXX from Wells Fargo and an outside credit card, were reduced down to XXXX correctly, and I was led to believe were closed. However, the Visa from Wells Fargo did not. I called them, and they said they never received the check I let them know I have evidence that the check was received. They said they didnt know where it was, and that I needed to cancel the check and reissue a check and send it out so I did. When the Wells Fargo finally received the check, they paid the account/cashed the check on XX/XX/XXXX. However, Wells Fargo did not credit the account back to XX/XX/XXXX when the initial check was received they attempted to charge me late fees and interest for that two month time period. My XXXX personal banker said that XXXX would deal with the extra fees and interest, because they felt I should not have to pay those fees or interest either.

When XXXX got the personal loan check delivered on XX/XX/XXXX, and got the extra fees and interest voided, the account was at XXXX.

About three weeks ago, XX/XX/XXXX, I started receiving phone calls from Wells Fargo in regards to my XXXX  and Visa. They stated that I still had outstanding balances on those cards and that the accounts were never closed. I was able to speak with an able minded individual in regards to the XXXX  who voided their accumulated {$40.00} and some dollars and closed the account. The Visa has not been accommodating they stated that when the account was paid to XXXX   on the XXXX that it was in the middle of a cycle and that the interest wasnt charged yet. Over the last 10 months these accounts have been accumulating interest, delinquency, and late fees ( approximately {$400.00} and some ). I have spoken to several banking institutions and even several Wells Fargo people that I have come in contact say that it is standard procedure to have backdated the payoff amount to the initial day it was received, XX/XX/XXXX and since they didnt do that, and still refuse to do that, my credit score is badly damaged.

Ive tried escalating the issue internally but the Wells Fargo representatives keep asking me to make a payment and then they can waive fees. I was finally able to get them to assign the case to an executive internally, but this individual would not speak with me, would not return my calls, and has yet tried to make contact directly. Wells Fargo states that they have sent out letters keeping me updated, but I have since moved and did not update Wells Fargo of my contact information given that I was told the accounts were closed. I have since let them know my mailing address but still have not received anything from the executive assigned to my case."
4583,"May credit card was closed on XX/XX/2017 by Wells Fargo. When I called to ask way my account was closed. I was told that i did not have a banking account with them. Which was not true I had three account 's with them. I had an joint account with my husband which was closed, because someone was writing fraudulent checks in his name. In which they were fully aware of and they still closed my account. I asked if i can open new savings account i was told no. This was not my fault I was never late all ways paid in full."

I also attached inside a schedule of fees to go along with those violation broken by the company. I will resend all those documents.

4589,"Hi, back to XX/XX/XXXX I lived in XXXX for my first time as a XXXX.

walk in to Wells Fargo bank and talk with a representative named XXXX.

she was always busy and nice I wait till she finished with others then she asked me to open an account because its good for me what ever, finally I got the card on the mail and the card was gray card with is different than my other back ( red ) I tough its a good card because of the color ... I had no idea what is credit or debit and how its effecting my score.

My process for a XXXX XXXX was apply for my family and I and its been a while since we had to go back to our country, i got back to USA after receiving my XXXX XXXX  in the mail and have it for about 2 yrs.

So after all I got my social security for 2 years and 2 Cards 1 from XXXX XXXX XXXX and one from XXXX with fico score from XXXX  and XXXX  is XXXX witch is very high as I have been told I tried to apply for "" Cash Wise '' card in Wells Fargo Bank in XX/XX/XXXX.

I got declined by the bank with not understanding the reason!

XXXX and XXXX didn't showed anything about Wells Fargo bank!

I visit a lady work in "" XXXX '' XXXX   somehow I told her the story then she Saied maybe XXXX report will show and that's what happened!

Finally I open the account on XXXX   with paying $ XXXX/Month I asked for Free check for all my credit Bureaus I sow the credit report and I see the problem!

Before I had the SSN in XX/XX/XXXX as a XXXX XXXX  from the bank opened a secured card under my name and just told me that this card is good for me!!! all this payments I did was for XXXX dollars all the time and I didn't understand the whole think, the card color the XXXX limit it just was a secure card from Wells Fargo! all this history waited to me when I just got my SSN than stick to my credit history!

I got like 4 month with late payments for my card because they charged me for having less than 1500 so its just build up and up.

At the end of the day I tough this is a Debit Card so I don't have to worries about the money that there because its my money and its not the bank so I can use it and max it out and its all good and not hurting no one.

so in XX/XX/XXXXI got into USA and walked in the branch and I had a balance on my acc and they told me its because the account didn't have XXXX  dollars in the Debit card so I have to pay the fees. I paid that also.

so what I did?

1. I fly from XXXX  for XXXX to talk with her and get it removed ( also I visit my family so it wasn't really bad to find out what happened with XXXX ) XXXX got fired from the Wells Fargo because she made a lot of bank accounts for others and make commission somehow, she apply for me with not under my permission and she speaks my language so you usually trust someone from ur country and ur language a little more ...

I got wrong by listening to her, she took advantage of my lonely here in XXXX and did something for her and thief commission from the bank!

2. I talked with XXXX  by applying for dispute, after about 2 or 4 weeks I got declined I don't know how to remove it so I talk now with CFBP and hope so see a positive answer."

4592,"I financed a pool through Wells Fargo. I was told it's a credit card and I would get the card and statement in the mail. I never received a card or statement. I called Wells Fargo over 20 times in a course of a year. I was told that a statement and a new card is coming, it's on online banking so statements are on there, they couldn't verify my information, they also mailed me late notices but couldn't give me a statement or account number, the escalated complaint team assigned me a case worker that promised to fix everything. Yet nothing was ever done. The final call where I spoke to someone was that he is going to personally mail me a copy of the statement that he printed out. Then reach out to the credit department for them to remove the late payment marks on my credit because of Wells Fargo mistakes. Again that never happened. I called the agent assigned to Me probably 10 more times after that and never got a returned call. Wells Fargo put me into collections now and hurt my credit even more. I never got the card or a statement the entire time the account was opened. They promised to correct the issues but never did. I think It's very unfair that they don't give a statement or even verify an account number so I can make a payment. Then when I don't make a payment penalize me because of it. I can't make a payment without an account number. Then they hit my credit for their mistake. They even admitted it's part of the contract that I receive monthly statements but i never did. 
Is there anything I can do with this situation."

I contacted my 2 U.S. Senators from Arizona, thats U.S. Senator XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX in regards to my issue. Senator XXXX and XXXX sent me a letter assuring me they would look into this matter and contact executives from Wells Fargo Bank to seek an immediate resolution to this matter.

Wells Fargo Bank Executives has appeared before Congress for congressional hearings the last few years to answer for Wells Fargo Bank opening up millions of checking and credit card accounts in peoples names all over the country without their permission or consent.

I have been going back and forth, asking Wells Fargo to help me dealing with the matter by showing proof that the money was indeed return to XXXX XXXX but to no avail. I have asked multiple times for the past 2 months and keep getting false promises that they will E-mail me the letter but they never do.

I told them due to my loss of income I couldn't afford the high payments. I asked if I could make $ 50 monthly payments. My wife was still making Payments and XXXX was still marking the account as late on my credit report. My account was closed and I strongly feel XXXX 's didn't want to help."
4604,"XX/XX/XXXX To whom it may concern : The purpose of this letter is to report wrongdoing by Wells Fargo that has caused financial hardships and adverse credit standing for me since XX/XX/XXXX. I have been in contact with Wells Fargo about a business credit card payment error where their online payment system processed a payment transaction resulting in a double payment on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Since I am retired and have a fixed income there was not sufficient funds available to pay Wells Fargo the XX/XX/XXXX payment due to the previous monthy payment being double the amount so XXXX payment was not paid. Wells Fargo contacted me and said that I would have to pay two payments for XX/XX/XXXX to make the account current. I managed to make a double payment in XX/XX/XXXX and they refunded the missed payment fee and made some adjustments. I asked about the effects on my personal credit score and the Wells Fargo representive said that since it was a business account that my personal credit score would not be affected. 

I checked my credit history this month and found that there was a drastic reduction of my credit score in XX/XX/XXXX. I believe the action of Wells Fargo was the reason my score dropped so much because I am current on all other accounts. My score has been low since then and I have not applied for a home equity loan, car loan or credit card as I had previously planned. Managing my credit is important to me and just when I got it up there all the planning I have done will be of no benefit this year. 

Confidence and trust in Wells Fargo is neccessary in order to do business there. I have also mailed an application to be part of a class action law suit against this company. I had not planned to do that until I learned that Wells Fargo had been untruthful to me. This happened in XX/XX/XXXX and they were still doing the multiple payment scam to others until this month. They knew about it and continued to do it. Unexcusable. 


Sincerely, Attachments :"
4608,On XX/XX/2020 my bill did not go through account with missed payment. I am kindly requesting WELLS FARGO BANK CAR to remove this missed payment from my credit reports as a gesture of goodwill. Doing so would sincerely be appreciated and represent an invaluable gift to my family and me.

For backstory, I went to XXXX XXXX in NY for a work meeting, I bought three rum and cokes and they were {$9.00} each, after tax and tip my total was {$35.00} for the three drinks. I left and came back within the hour and ordered the exact same three drinks but this time I was with my coworker, my card was on file. Upon waking up the next morning ( Knowing I never accurately signed a receipt upon leaving ) I noticed a charge of {$81.00} including the original {$35.00} from my first visit. My guess is that the bartender put my coworkers drinks on my tab and possibly my coworker may have signed the receipt. In any case, there should only be two charges for {$35.00} ( generously ) and I was wrongly charged {$46.00} which isn't a large sum of money but Wells Fargo basically told me to go XXXX. 

Would love to see this get resolved as its not so much about the money but the principle and shadiness behind Wells Fargo Claim process."

4625,"Fraudulent charge made by XXXX XXXX XXXX Tel XXXX on XX/XX/2018 for total of {$2400.00}. Submitted claim to Wells Fargo. They did not initiate a fraud investigation. They did not refund the card for the amount. The bank is taking no responsibility, even though it has a chip and I have the card and it could not have bee used at the store. Bank says to talk to merchant. Merchant says to talk to bank, and customer gets XXXX in the process!"
4629,wells Fargo will not give me my money back for charge that was not made by me and the company already admitted it was not me
4630,"The Wells Fargo credit card is a card that the company where I work ( XXXX XXXX XXXX gave me to pay my expenses related to the work I do, such as travel expenses, meals, gasoline, etc. However, when reviewing my expenses made in XX/XX/2019, I realized that XXXX expenses appeared that I did not make or authorize a purchase. later, for the month of XXXX of the same year, XXXX unauthorized expenses appeared, giving a total of {$6800.00} USD divided into XXXX unidentified expenses. I reported these expenses directly with the Wells Fargo Bank, they told me that this claim could not proceed since I still have the credit card in my possession and therefore the expenses do not proceed for review and return, later I did a second report with the same result. XXXX proceeded to directly request the revision of this problem again by means of a letter sent to the bank, the answer is that the investigation does not proceed. They can not verify that I did not make these expenses, but neither do they verify that I make them, when making a purchase in Mexico with a credit card, you have to sign the ticket where you authorize a purchase, however I request that the bank will do a double check who made these purchases in establishments and check who misused the card."
4631,"I banked with wells fargo since XX/XX/XXXX and had a secured card with them as well. Last summer in XX/XX/XXXX I decided to close my checking account with them and pay off my secured card. I was going to close the secured card but the banker told me that was a bad idea and that I should instead not use the card anymore and then I would get my refund and the card would "" fall off ''. I did as the banker informed me to do and little did I know until I saw an email from wells Fargo that I owed a balance on a platinum visa. I called and inquired about what happened and they told me they upgraded me from a secured card to a platinum card. I did not consent to this nor was this ever disclosed to me prior to getting a secured card. I closed that card because I never authorized the upgrade and was told the secure card would fall off and there would not be an active account for that credit card. I feel that I have been deceived by wells fargo. And now this will be reported on my credit that I closed the credit card and that is not good for my credit."
4633,I received a notice from Wells Fargo bank stating that they were thanking me for opening a credit card and that I would soon receive it in the mail. I never applied for a credit card with Wells Fargo. I called Wells Fargo and asked what was going on. They looked and said a card was opened in my name no charges had been made and that I should be receiving my credit card in the mail to my address. I told them I did not apply for this credit card I do not want it. They said it mustve been opened in my name fraudulently which did not make any sense to me considering the mail came to my house and no charges were made on it. They said the card was open on XX/XX/2021. XXXX concerned this is more fraudulent activity by Wells Fargo.
4634,"On XX/XX/2021, I sent a letter to Wells Fargo in regards of an account being reported to the credit bureaus where they are reporting different numbers than my records. but they sent me a letter without the whole number that I requested. 
I wanted to know if the account was sold, and if so to whom. I sent a follow up letter on XX/XX/2021 and it was ignored."
4636,"XXXX XXXX, 2017, I received an email message that there had been an expenditure on my closed credit card account. When I telephoned the company to report the theft, I was phished for information that included my account password. I refused to divulge it and the operator would not investigate the problem or transfer me to the security people. The credited card issuer is Wells Fargo. I had closed the account last year. Apparently, Wells Fargo is encouraging illegal activities among its staff again."
4638,On XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a phone off XXXX XXXX and used my wells fargo debit card on XXXX XXXX to pay seller who didn't send the phone and blocked me for all means of contacts I contacted the bank while the payment was still showing as pending but was dragged in forms and calls till it cleared.

4640,"Hello my name is XXXX XXXX in XXXX I purchased {$7100.00} of Furniture form Mega Furniture. The store promotion was no interest financing until XXXX ( see flyer ). 
When discussing how much I wanted to pay I requested $ 250 monthly payments. We calculated it would take about 29 months, and with a 36 month agreement I could have it paid off early and have a cushion just in case anything happened. 
When finalizing the paperwork the agreement read only 12 months interest free when asked about the 36 months, I was in formed that the promotion is 12 months at a time and if I make my payments on time the promotion would automatically renew, that was the special financing ( see attached financing promotional ads ), reassured I signed the agreement. In XXXX I received the notice that my promotional financing was ending. I called Wells Fargo and they confirmed all my payments have been made on time but that does not renew the promotional terms I was advised to contact the store. 
I contacted the store spoke to XXXX my salesman and he said he should renew, he then went and spoke to his manager who said she would have to look up the agreement and call me back. 
When she called me back she informed me that they no longer work with Wells Fargo for financing and the agreement says it was only for 12 months. I explained to her that is not what I was told when I signed it and XXXX just confirmed that is should automatically renew. She apologized and said he did not understand the question. But there was no question it what he told be a the reason I agreed. To pay off that amount in a year I would have had to pay over {$600.00} a month which I would absolutely not be able to agree to as I could not afford that high of a monthly payment. She again apologized for the confusion and advised there nothing they could do. 
Distraught I called Wells Fargo back and again explained the situation and was advised all I could do was dispute this. This is my second dispute I contacted the XXXX  and was replied to by XXXX XXXX who I also spoke to. I advised her of the situation and that Wells Fargo has been great with working with me and advised they will change the terms XXXX XXXX just need to submit a Terms Change Request Form. 
XXXX requested that Wells Fargo send them the form as they are no longer vendors. XXXX Wells Fargo sent it over the same day and XXXX confirmed it was received and she would forward it to accounting. I followed up a week later XXXX advised me there were items on the form that they did not know as they are no longer vendors she requested Wells Fargo contact them directly to help complete the form so they can submit it. XXXX Wells Fargo called the same day. XXXX thanked me for getting Wells Fargo to make the call and the form will be completed. Confirmed with Wells that they spoke and gave all the information to complete the form. I agreed to close my XXXX   complaint.

4641,"Wellsfargo has violated me by closing out consumer credit transaction accounts which I as the original creditor had established due to alleged late payments. I paid these people and they closed out my account! Ever since they closed out my account it has caused nothing but harm and an enormous amount of stress. They reported negative adverse information to my credit report which has done nothing but put a burden on my life! They mad violated me yo! Every time I spoke to a representative they told me that my account would not be closed due to covid-19 effecting my income however, when I went to login to my account it was closed down and told me i no longer had any products with them. I was speechless yo ( shaking my head ). They also closed out previous bank accounts that i had with them as well without my knowledge. At this point they have totally committed unauthorized use ( 15 USC1602 ) as the cardholder, I was not granted proper documentation nor the full disclosure that I needed in order to correct, if anything, my payments. I was on an open ended credit plan so there should not have been any alleged late payments at all reported due to the finance charge within the contract agreement which if they upheld their practices accordingly they would know is the sum of all charges! This is discrimination without a doubt and fraud ( 15 USC 1691 ). Because of the negative reports Wellsfargo made to the credit bureaus it has been a hassle getting approved for credit cards, bank accounts, automobiles and living headquarters just to name a few. This has been effecting me mentally and physically over the course of time and i'm tired of the abuse and i'm seeking remedy. I never even gave them written permission to report any of my information to any credit reporting agency which is totally identity theft! I don't understand how banks expect to have our confidence as consumers when they brake the law and build mistrust with its consumers. Absolutely crazy to me."
4644,"The issue revolves around the dispute of 3 charges of {$15.00} totaling {$45.00}. I have purchased three {$100.00} cards on XXXX ( XXXX ) which were fine. However the 3 x {$15.00} XXXX gift codes that came with the card were invalid. XXXX refused to address the issue blaming XXXX digital for it. 
Subsequently I disputed the purchase with Wells Fargo ( Acct # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and I received the note that the dispute was resolved in my favor and {$15.00} instead of {$45.00} has been credited. When I called the CSR line that later transferred me over to dispute line, the issue was not resolved. The dispute person blamed the issue on "" the system '' while attempting to re-open the case once more with details over the transaction. I have provided a very detailed account of the dispute including purchase details and I was astounded to hear that the dispute has not been addressed. Subsequently I was transferred to WF 's executive customer service line where I was mocked as the person on the other line, XXXX XXXX claimed she could n't hear me very well. I have made numerous calls that day and my phone line was completely fine as I could hear both CSRs and dispute dept person very well. 

The issues worth asking : 1 ) How many times does it take for WF to get a dispute such as this right? 
2 ) What is an appropriate amount of time WF feels its consumer can be put on hold? 
3 ) Where is the accountability to make sure that the dispute process is dealt with in honest and transparent manner and not in bad faith and deceptively? 

Resolution : {$45.00} credited to my account."
4645,"On XXXX XXXX, 2018 I received in the mail a XXXX credit card from Wells Fargo that I never applied for. I immediately called Wells Fargo ( after verifying the phone number on their website ). Their department that investigates matters like these is supposedly looking into it and will call me in the next day or two. Rather than giving them any personal information over the phone, I told them that I would go to a Wells Fargo branch to officially close the account."
4646,I contacted XXXX collection several months ago because of COVID 19 I was not able to make my payment. The collector advised me that it would not be a problem to extend my payment one month. Unfortunately he never extended the account causing it to report to my credit 30 days late.
4647,"I contacted Wells Fargo Bank today XXXX, XXXX, 2017, to provide additional evidence to support my case in a large purchase I made, for which the merchant did not provide. I was told there is nothing more I can do and that after arbitration, there is no more appeal process. What frustrates me is that on multiple occasions, when this bank has decided a dispute in my favor, they have come back and changed their minds. However, in a large transaction, where the merchant did not perform the service they promised, my bank is refusing to help me. They are refusing to accept new evidence and are saying there is nothing further I can do. The bank 's dispute process and arbitration is biased toward businesses and they are not advocating for their customers, as they promise. Furthermore, in the initial consultation, I was never told this dispute was going to arbitration. Instead, I was told by the dispute analyst, XXXX XXXX, that all I needed to get was an invoice or an estimate from another merchant to show the service was not as expected ; yet the dispute was still decided against me. I was not given full disclosure to the magnitude of this process and now, after reaching out a second merchant for definitive proof that I did not get the service I was charged for, the bank is still refusing to help me with this. I filed a complaint earlier about this matter in the previous evidence. This new complaint is about the fact that my bank is refusing to accept the new evidence I am presenting and they are retaliating against me for filing the original CFPB complaint. I have been a Wells Fargo customer for years and it is shameful that they are treating me like this. This transaction is worth 1 full month of my paycheck and my bank is helping this other business rob me of my money."
4653,"I contacted Wells Fargo in an attempt to close a credit card account opened for me unauthorizedly as part of the Wells Fargo account fraud scandal. I had previously paid off the card a day prior. 

Upon explaining that the account was opened for me in an unauthorized manner, the representative suddenly went off-script and indicated, instead of continuing the procedure to close the account, that their company lists unauthorized accounts ( read : accounts opened illegally in customers ' names by representatives of Wells Fargo ) separately in their internal systems from accounts opened directly by customers. This immediately struck me as indicative of a broader organizational effort to engage in, curate, or otherwise downplay fraud as part of the unauthorized accounts scheme. Before I could press further, I was transferred on to a second representative, who indicated she was part of a customer service department. 

This individual also refused to close the account, instead noting that she was unable to do so. Instead, she offered a "" case number '' and indicated that I would receive further correspondence on the issue. 

A full, unabridged recording of the call with both representatives is available upon request. Additional identifying information or essential case details may be provided upon request."
4654,"I had two balance transfer transactions on the same card. Both with unique transaction IDs and expiration dates. I was approaching the expiration on the first one and inquired through the customer service number how I would go about making a payment to pay that particular balance off. I was informed that I would have to wait until the day that offer expired to make the payment being as that balance would then be assigned an APR ( where all previous balances were at zero APR ). I called the card company again when that day came and asked if that was indeed correct. They said that I should submit the payment and they would apply my minimum payment according to their terms and everything paid beyond that would be applied to the balance with the highest APR. Seeing as that balance was expiring that day the customer service rep said I was good to go forward with paying that balance off. I made the payment moments later through their online app and didnt think anything more about it. I received my new statement and found that not only was my payment not applied to that balance, but they also extended that particular transfer offer another month. Only about a tenth of the almost {$1000.00} dollar payment was applied to the expiring balance and the rest was applied to the other balance transfer that didnt expire for months. I opened a case that day with the customer service department who was supposed to return my call with any updates or results since they didnt understand why the offer was extended another month and not sure it can be fix now that the payment has been applied. 
A week went by with no phone calls. I called back and was told there was no open case and was transferred to the executive office who proceeded to open a case and send me to a supervisor. That was over a month ago. I have called roughly once a week to check up seeing as no one ever called me back as they claimed they would. I have spoken to countless supervisors and case managers who continue to say weve never seen anything like that and I dont know how that happened or how we can fix it. I even opened a resolution case with the bank that the card is issued by and that case was closed 20 minutes later because a case with the executive office is already open and they will take care of the issue. I just received my newest statement which now has interest included for that remaining ( now expired ) balance transfer that should have been paid off two months ago. I should probably mention that I also work for this same bank and even being both an employee and a customer has gotten me no closer to the issue being resolved."
4655,"I received an email on XX/XX/XXXX that my new credit card was being shipped to an address I was not familiar with and should arrived in 3 - 5 days. I had no prior contact regarding this action. 
When I called the individuals name was provided which was foreign to me. My credit card was cancelled and a new one is being issued. When I asked how they could issue a card without first contacting the principle account holder to confirm, I was told that if the full card information is available they will add the individual and send out the card. I asked if the last four digits of my social security number was provided since that is always requested of me. I did not get a direct answer. 
At my request, I was transferred to the Fraud Department who could add no further detail but did mention that the information is easy to obtain on the dark web. 
When I went to Florida in XXXX I conducted some business with the bank through my XXXX. The next day I got an email indicating my account had been accessed from a different device and that no action was necessary if it was me. 
I believe the policy that allows a credit card to be issued without checking with the principle account holder abets fraud. It is unimaginable that with the ease of acquiring personal information that this would be permitted. 
No financial loss occurred so the Sheriff 's Department closed the case but did establish a record. No answer as to whether or not the bank would initiate any action. 
The company is Wells Fargo. It begs the question as to whether or not representatives get a stipend for new cards issued."
4661,"I opened a Wells Fargo credit card with 0 % for 15 months. I initiated a balance transfer of {$5000.00} dollars from my new credit card to XXXX XXXX XXXX sky miles card. It never posted to XXXX XXXX and I 'm being charged interest every month! XXXX XXXX claims they never received the money, Wells Fargo claims they sent the money at the beginning of XXXX. Wells Fargo ca n't provide me with any transaction info I if they actually sent it, where they sent it, or anything else. In this day and age, it ca n't be possible that transactions are n't easily traceable. This is absolutely ridiculous. I 've contacted both institutions multiple times, I 'm basically being robbed of money in interest."
4662,"XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I logged into my Wells Fargo account and saw that there was an overdue balance of {$27.00}. When I called, they said that they upgraded me to a XXXX XXXX card since I was a valued customer and that because of this upgrade, my payment increased to {$62.00}. They replied that I was suppose to "" Opt out '' if I did not want this card. After much ado, they agreed that they would write off the {$27.00} and "" downgrade '' my card but that I am still considered past due. I then asked if this would inpact my credit score and they said yes, it was possible. I did not charge anything and did not authorize an increase or upgrade. They should not be allowed to charge more money anytime they want and then say to the consumer that it is our job to "" opt out ''. 

Why is a company allowed to upgrade me and charge me more money without my consent? This seems to be what got Wells Fargo in trouble to begin with. 

I have asked them to provide me with a letter so that I can send to the credit bureau since they said it most likely was reported as being a late payment. Someone is supposed to call me back from claims management. Ridiculous practice! 

Please review this practice."
4664,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX Credit Card. I am a customer of the bank for over five years and am in good standing and got a credit score in the top 20 % of the population. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo closed the account, without notifying me. I eventually found out on the customer portal of Wells Fargo and subsequently filed a complained with CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX. ( CFPB Case # XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX answered to parts of my complaint on behalf of Wells Fargo thru the CFPB. While many questions remained unanswered, according to Wells Fargo the account was closed "" by our Fraud Department due to a possible fraudulent application being submitted. '' It was suggested by Wells Fargo, that I should submit a new application by either of the following three options : 1. You may go online at wellsfargo.com website. 
2. You may apply by phone at XXXX. Agents are available to assist you Monday- Sunday, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), ET. 
3. You may apply at your local Wells Fargo Branch, when you are back in the United States. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I did as suggested and opted for ( 1 ) above ( Application # XXXX ). This time the credit was not auto approved. Today, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX but postmarked XX/XX/XXXX in which Wells Fargo informs me, that my application after "" careful review '' was denied. The resaon given for the denial was : "" This is a duplicate application ; you have already responded to this credit offer '' I am sorry, but this is totally absurd! It was Wells Fargo which cancelled the previous account without ever explaining, why a fraud was suspected or why they would n't inform me of such suspicion. It was Wells Fargo who suggested I should apply again, as the old account could not be reopened. What did I do wrong? What has changed, that I was initially approved and am now rejected?"
4666,"I have noticed that my Wells Fargo XXXX credit card statement has been consistently misapplying credit cards payments since XX/XX/XXXX. For example, I made recent online banking payments ( transfer from checking to credit card ) on XX/XX/XXXX for {$500.00}, XX/XX/XXXX for {$500.00}, XX/XX/XXXX for {$400.00}, and XX/XX/XXXX for {$1100.00} - each transaction was credited then subtracted twice from my balance. Thus, leaving me with a growing outstanding balance. On XX/XX/XXXX I logged into my Wells Fargo online banking account and noticed that the XX/XX/XXXX payment for {$500.00} that I made to my XXXX credit card was added to my outstanding balance. I called Wells Fargo today XX/XX/XXXX and told by their representative XXXX that the bank knows about the issue and has been working on it. Wells Fargo never issued a notice to its customers to notify about this problem thats been ongoing with their system for well over a month and a half, and its unacceptable to not have this matter rectified immediately. I would like to know the following : ( 1 ) why hasnt Wells Fargo notified its customers of this problem? and ( 2 ) I want my account to be immediately credited {$500.00} that was erroneously added to my running balance when in fact it was a payment on XX/XX/XXXX?"
4668,"On XX/XX/XXXX I hired XXXX  ( an heating and air company ) to inspect my two HVAC systems. The service charge was {$78.00} for the inspection. Their technician indicated that I also needed a new fan motor which was an additional {$500.00} charge. I never received the motor or service although I did follow up with this company to find out why. The last response that I received was that they were checking with their parts department, but I was never re-contacted. Based upon this failure, I contacted my Credit Card Issuer ( Well FARGO BANK ), and requested a dispute .be placed against this merchant for the {$500.00} charge. I further stated that the {$78.00} part of the charge was appropriate. I was told by the WFB employee that the charge was being put on hold pending resolution ( CC. # ending in XXXX ). 
I received my next billing statement in XXXX, XXXX indicating that the bank had switch the credited amount from {$500.00} to {$78.00}, and that I owed a balance of {$420.00}. After speaking with a manager in WF Credit Card Dept, I sent documentations to them ( ( dispute file # XXXX ). The manager stated that in any transaction, that only one disputed was allowed. He further indicated that XXXX  had not responded to their initial inquiry. In my letter to WFB 's CC Dept sent 0n XX/XX/XXXX, I included XXXX invoice ; the previous CC statement showing my withholding of {$500.00} ; and a copy of the charge showing a balance of $ XXXX also pointed out that their voice prompt indicates that calls to their department are recorded and a review will show that their employee mistakenly switch the disputed amount.. As of this date they are still showing a balance on my most recent statement. The Bank has not re-contacted me over the past month about this matter."
4670,"Good morning, yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a new credit card statement from Wells Fargo regarding my XXXX XXXX XXXX  card.Upon looking at it, I was charged {$830.00} in interest. The problem with that was that I was receiving emails from Wells Fargo stating that I had until XX/XX/XXXX to pay off my remaining balance in full before I would start getting charged interest. The first email came on XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX ; and I received a second onXX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, which was hours before Wells Fargo sent me that statement with the interest charge. I have attached both emails as .txt documents below.

I then questioned Wells Fargo via message center on their website and I received a response from someone named XXXX and part of her response was : "" You have two promotion on this account with no interest if paid if full that ends on separate dates. The first purchase made on XX/XX/XXXX expired on XX/XX/XXXX and the second purchase made on XX/XX/XXXX expires on XX/XX/XXXX. '' I was never informed of a promotion that ends on XX/XX/XXXX, since I have set up my Wells Fargo account to automatically send payments on certain dates to avoid late fees. Those two initial reminders form Wells Fargo about interest fees certainly did n't mention anything about XX/XX/XXXX. I again contacted XXXX via the message center and asked why I was being charged something I was never informed about when they did n't hesitate to remind me twice about interest before, and I was willing to pay off the remainder of my balance minus the interest fee, which was {$300.00} right then and there if the fee was waived. She replied there was nothing she could do and I then sent a response saying to cancel my card, I would like to speak to a manager, and that this practice is deceptive because it charges on a fee that was never mentioned before. I never received a reply after that, so I am assuming that they have closed the complaint. I have also attached those conversations below.

The real problem about this is that I was systematically trying to pay off my debts to raise my credit score because I am trying to buy a home. My balance for this Wells Fargo card before the interest fee was {$300.00}, which I was planning to pay off on a weekly basis until XX/XX/XXXX, which is what I was told by Wells Fargo was the deadline to pay in full without interest fees. In fact, I had a payment scheduled on XX/XX/XXXX that cleared for {$100.00} to get the balance down to {$200.00} and I would pay off the rest the next two weeks. It is unfair to be charged {$830.00} in interest unknowingly for a {$300.00} balance all because the credit card company was informing me of a date later down the line. Having a balance of {$1100.00} is a big difference than having no balance at all when it comes to paying off bills, and that charge is really going to set me back."
4671,"Hello, On XX/XX/2021, I returned from XXXX to my home in XXXX XXXX, NC. I informed the bank of my travel dates. 
On XX/XX/2021, when I was at a XXXX in XXXX, NC ( close to my home ) I received a text message ( attached ) from Wells Fargo asking me to verify my purchase activity. The text asked about a {$1000.00} charge at XXXX XXXX NY and then another charge at the same vendor for {$970.00}. I did not reply to that particular text, and I never authorized those purchases. For some reason, Wells Fargo removed the {$1000.00} charge without my intervention but they accepted the {$970.00}. However, they cancelled my credit card, because as I was at XXXX ( XXXX, NC ) my credit card was rejected, which means that they had suspicions of fraudulent activity. I used my debit card ( from the same institution, Wells Fargo ) at that XXXX. I have included screenshots of both the credit card account and the debit card account so that the information showing proof of me being in NC buying at XXXX ( where my credit card was rejected ) is highlighted. 

Two days later, I opened a dispute on the remaining {$970.00}. The whole process has been XXXX. I have spent more than 8 hours talking to generally unkind and unhelpful representatives. I have asked them to re-open the case three times, and all they say is that my fraud request claim has been denied because "" Since your credit card was in your possession at the time of the transaction, it was concluded that the charge was authorized and the claim was closed. '' While the credit card was indeed in my possession, as I was trying to use it at XXXX, the {$970.00} charge at XXXX XXXX NY is a fraudulent one. I can not be both at the XXXX XXXX in NY and the XXXX at NC, where I live, at the same time. 

I faxed the same materials that I am attaching here at the request of one of the representatives ; one of them confirmed that they have received them and were considering them. Then a second one denied that I had sent that fax. I did send the fax and I even used the fax at the local branch of Wells Fargo in XXXX XXXX, NC. The manager of the branch sent those documents herself and was very kind. 

At this point, they just want me to accept that I made a purchase in NY and they do not believe me, nor they have considered the proof. I have offered them to contact witnesses, to ask me any questions, and they keep saying that since the card was in my possession and a chip was used and a chip can not be duplicated, that I must have done the purchase. 

I am a mom, a home owner, I have good credit, I have had the same job for 12 years, I have a PhD and an MA, I have been a customer of wells fargo for 20 years, I have always paid all my loans and bills on time, I don't have a criminal record, I have not committed fraud in my whole life, and yet they say that I had the card and I made the purchase, but they do not show proof of it even when I have requested proof. 

I am despearte at this point, since it is their word against mine and they refuse to look at the attached materials. Nothing I can do convinces them. Thank you so much for your help, XXXX"
4673,"Wells Fargo is refusing to settle the amounts on my credit cards presented to them that I did not authorize or know the party, merchant or property involved, but my creditcard has been used without knowledge for these expected fees.

They are unable to provided any history on your individual opening branch account. 
They falsify when your account was opened. I have the documents to prove the history Why don't they provide those documents? They have received those documents and why don't they respond accordingly when you continually ask why nothing has been accomplished to attempt to resolve? 
I have the names of these unknowns on Wells Fargo letter heads that are incompetent of resolving. I have the calling cards of people who could never help resolve any issues. Some have been fired. 
It is very obvious that their executive office continues to defraud the public. This is public abuse and abandoment and fraud. They have found financial errors they made cheating me out of my hard earned money and can not answer any questions as to why. The local Well 's Fargo branches will write down your questions and those specific questions are never answered. Why has my bank acounts been purged? The 7 years of History has been destroyed. Where have they gone? These claims are on currently held required by law. 

The CFPB needs to investigate these people and the banks that have done this to me. 
I have the documents to be to provide as evidence."
4677,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo regarding a charge of {$1.00} on my card. The representative couldn't tell me why I was being charged the {$1.00}. There was a heated argument between myself and the representative over the charge to my account. The call ended shortly after that, and on the very same day, I discovered that there was a payment to my card that was posted in the amount of {$1500.00}. I never authorized that payment, and a few days later my checking account with my normal bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, didn't have the funds to cover the payment of {$1500.00}, so XXXX  charged me {$32.00}, and Wells Fargo charged me {$27.00}. I went in person to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX and told them to not attempt to collect the {$1500.00} since I never authorized that payment. On XX/XX/XXXX, they collected the {$1500.00} from the payment that I didn't authorized even though I told them in person and on the phone not to attempt to collect. XXXX  charged me another {$32.00}, {$5.00} for withdrawing money from savings account, and the {$1500.00} from my checking account.

On XX/XX/XXXXI scheduled a payment for {$100.00} on the Wells Fargo card. It doesn't make any sense that I would schedule a payment of {$100.00}, then on the same day schedule another payment for {$1500.00}. I am sure that the Wells Fargo representative that I argued with over the phone was the one that scheduled the payment of {$1500.00}, and I like there to be an investigation into this matter.

Thank you very much and I appreciate any help you can offer."
4686,"The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is issued by Wells Fargo. I make on-time payments through my bank, and I received a letter from Wells Fargo, notifying that they decreased my credit limit, which placed my credit use at 115 %. This creates an issue because it immediately lowered my credit score. The letter states that they are choosing not to reveal the reasons why they decreased my credit limit. This is an abusive practice and is detrimental to my credit history."
4688,"I filed for bankruptcy. In speaking with my attorney, he advised me to stop automatic payment withdrawals on all credit cards which I did. I cancelled my Wells Fargo XXXX account three times since XX/XX/XXXX. I have emails to show the cancellations. The withdrawals still came out. This last time the withdrawal caused my account to go negative. I called them to complain about the situation that they have now taken approximately {$400.00} out of my account that was not authorized. They spoke to me as if I was uneducated and said I must not be cancelling it correctly yet I have emails showing the cancellation should have been completed. They told me I was re enrolling which I most certainly did not as I was following my attorney 's advice. I will now have to open a dispute with my bank since the charge came through. I just think this is very unfair since I cancelled the automatic payment withdrawals."
4689,"In XX/XX/XXXX contacted Wells Fargo to setup payment plan arrangements with them for my current ( not past due ) closed XXXX  XXXX card that was closed in XX/XX/XXXX while I was having technical and other issues and was locked out of my account. 
A week later my oldest XXXX  credit card was closed because I made payment arrangements with these people, which makes absolutely no sense. That account was also current and not past due. 
This will reduce my overall available credit and adversely affect my credit score and I absolutely did nothing to deserve this outcome! I was being a responsible and diligent customer and they close another account. HOW XXXX  IS THAT!?

Even more atrocious is the fact that they didn't even put the outstanding balance of the newly closed credit card account on a payment plan since it was closed due to the payment plan arrangements I made for the other card. This is some of the most backward and almost malicious thinking and practices that I have ever heard of! 
WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT!?!? 

They are refusing to open the account citing the false excuse that it was not closed due to bank error when it absolutely was because they didn't state what the logic of doing so was and both accounts were in current and good standing. This was absolutely a bank error!

4699,"This in reference to my Wells Fargo Financial Platinum Visa card that I been a member since XXXX. 
For the year XXXX, I was charged {$180.00} in late fees. My payments are due on the XXXX of each month.

They charged me late fees even when the bill was showing the money was paid. 
They paid me back {$80.00} as a one-time courtesy as if I failed to make my payments. The person on the phone was rude and side it was my fault I have to abide by their rules of payment. - I do not understand. I only know to pay my bills before the payment deadline."
4700,"On XX/XX/XXXX we obtained credit from Wells Fargo ( classified as XXXX XXXX - issued through our HVAC vendor ) to cover the expenses of a major purchase in the amount of approximately {$9900.00}. For this loan we were given a special interest rate of 9.9 % APR. Most months we paid slightly more than the minimum payment ( minimum payment was {$180.00}, we payed {$200.00} per month ). 

We have not made any other charges to the credit card until XX/XX/XXXX, when we experienced another need for expensive repairs. Since we were using the same vendor we asked if we could charge the cost against the same card and asked if Wells Fargo was offering any special finance terms. The woman in the finance office contacted Wells Fargo and we learned that there was a special finance offer of 0.0 % for 18 months. We elected to take advantage of this offer. 

When the new charge appeared on our credit card statement I increased the amount of our payment to $ XXXX/Month. On my XX/XX/XXXX statement I noticed that the loan amount of the no interest loan was not decreasing enough on monthly basis for the loan to be paid off in 18 months ( the balance on the no interest load was decreasing each month {$57.00} ). So for the XXXX payment I increased the amount to {$290.00}. When I received my statement for the following month, the amount applied to the no interest balance was still only {$57.00} ). 

I called Wells Fargo to ask what I need to do to reduce the balance on a monthly basis in order to pay it off at the end of the special rate period. I was told that there was nothing that I could do, that the way they apply payments is to apply first to the balance against which interest is charged, then once that balance is paid in full the payments will be applied to the no interest portion of credit card balance. Either what she told me is not entirely true, or I misunderstood what she said, since they are applying {$57.00} against the no interest balance each month. If the monthly payment was being applied against the outstanding balance with interest then the no interest balance would not being reduced at all. 

The no interest balance has a APR of 28.99 % and this interest is being deferred, and if I do not pay off this balance within the allotted timeframe then I will be charged the entire deferred interest charge, which will be slightly less than the original loan amount. 

The way Wells Fargo is applying the monthly payments makes it impossible for me to pay the no interest loan prior to special terms end date. This practice seems deceptive and predatory, especially given the fact that I made an effort to arrange to direct my payments to pay off this balance within the agreed timeframe."
4707,"Description of Complaint : This is about a lightly used credit card. I accepted an offer on XX/XX/2020 to transfer {$5700.00} in balances from other credit cards to my wells fargo card ( and pay a {$230.00} fee for doing so ) in exchange for no interest for a year or so. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a {$3700.00} payment ( no purchases in the mean time ) because we were purchasing a house and I was advised that making this payment would significantly reduce the interest rate on my new home loan. My remaining balance was {$2200.00} with minimum required monthly payment of {$25.00}, which was set up on auto pay from my bank account. I was not aware of the interest charge because the account is set up on auto bill and I was not using the account. Later this summer, my wife inadvertently charged our lawn mowing service to this card. l immediately contacted Wells Fargo to determine the amount of payment I needed to make to continue to avoid interest and they could not tell me. It was then that I discovered they had been charging me interest since I made the large payment in XXXX!!!! I have made payments and they continue to charge me interest. Called several times, keep getting put on hold and hung up on. No one can even tell me why this has happened."

I was told the furniture had no interest if paid in XXXX months and the hot tub, no interest if paid in XXXX months. I have been paying over the minimum payment all year, and now received a call that Wells Fargo, the card issuer, is charging interest. I am baffled, since my balance is much lower than the lawn furniture cost, since I paid more than the minimum every month. Now, the woman is explaining it is XXXX different types of promotions and it depends on the way they applied the payments. I am very upset with how poorly the promotion was explained. I have been fortunate enough to use deferred and no interest offers through different banks and never had this problem! Wells Fargo needs to be reigned in."

I have disputed these charges with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/21. Their fraud and member services opened a claim. The claim number is XXXX.

They say it was because of my poor credit history. I never late in this card, paid on time. But they did not even bother to give me notice of their decision to close it. My poor credit history is not because I do not pay, but because of the debt settlement and was being handled. I even have more than enough checking funds to cover the measly {$2500.00} credit they gave me. 

My only issue with them is the unfair treatment I received, because of the perception they think based on my credit score, but not based on my performance in how I pay their issued credit card to me and as a matter of fact I am excellent consumer, never late, nor missed a payment."

I was told a certain price, late-night arriving a long flight and I agreed, my main concern would have been the security deposit, for which this company XXXX Rental CaXXXX asked for XXXX Euro deposit. I've picked up the car, SIGN THE RENTAL CONTRACT and give my Wells Fargo credit card. 
XXXX days after, I've checked my statement online, my card was charged a huge amount ( {$4100.00} ), so I've called the rental office and I was told that was a misunderstanding between us, the amount told was referring actually/month, I needed the car for XXXX days. When I ask the price for XXXX days, the rental agent/owner told me XXXXEuro with XXXXeuro deposit. He agreed to take the car back. 
Dropping off the car on XX/XX/2021, I was very nervous because that can not ever happen when I request a quote, and I was told that my credit card would be credited the rest of unused days = XXXX days. He said that I will receive an email with my bill. 
As of today, that car rental never returned a penny, I disputed XXXX with Wells Fargo and both times I was denied. Spoke to the executive dept, the same answer. Last week I've closed the account with them, there is no way for me to pay that amount for XXXX days of rental, XXXX closed the XXXX claims while I was abroad they would send everything thru the mail, by the time I could talk to someone in regard to my claim, my claim would be closed because of certain days limit. I've tried very hard to talk to Wells Fargo/many times they don't care and want to keep me responsible for something that I have not used.

4733,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a credit card offer form Wells Fargo Financial Bank located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, South Dakota, XXXX for a possible line of credit. I applied for the credit card and was approved on XX/XX/XXXX. This card was secured with Wells Fargo Financial having a secured interest in my home. The following year, I was unemployed and filed for Chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. I listed the credit card as a part of the bankruptcy and assumed it would be discharged with the rest of my debt. In XX/XX/XXXX, the bankruptcy was discharged and I have since moved on thinking that this credit card was a part of the discharge. I am currently in the process of trying to refinance my mortgage with a different financial institution and have qualified and been approved for the refinance. Upon review with the title company, it was discovered that this credit card debt was showing up as a interest in my property and the title company is refusing to remove this item even though I submitted the bankruptcy discharge information. After learning of the situation, I contacted my bankruptcy attorney on XX/XX/XXXX to determine what can be done about this. I learned from the attorney that because of the secured interest in my home, there is nothing that they could do, however, I was informed that other clients in similar situations with the same credit card have been able to get a release/settlement due to fraudulent practices demonstrated by Wells Fargo. Upon my research on the internet, I was able to find the XX/XX/XXXX class action lawsuit against Wells Fargo in the state of New York where they settled with credit card consumers for {$4.00} XXXX dollars. They were in violation of policy violations, which put consumers ' home at risk. Wells Fargo Financial Credit Services of New York, a Wells Fargo affiliate, acquired XXXX Home Equity Lines of Credit through which they offered a secured credit card called the XXXX XXXX Platinum, which I had. This allowed consumers to secure their credit card purchases using interest on their home loans -- a practice that is not permissible under the law in the state of New York. There is evidence that on top of the illegal practices it in engaged in, Wells Fargo altered and falsified income documents, in order to qualify borrowers for loans that would otherwise be denied. On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a formal complaint against Wells Fargo with the Office of Minnesota Attorney General XXXX XXXX 's office. 

The Attorney General 's office has also contacted Wells Fargo on my behalf and has requested written response from them regarding my claims. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I also filed a complaint with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency."

I emailed Wells Fargo immediately and was told that these payments were "" on hold until XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX '' as I had made "" too many payments '' to my account this month. Another check of both my Wells Fargo account and my bank accounts showed that not only does my Wells Fargo show these payments as posted, but my Bank accounts show the money as having been withdrawn from my bank accounts on XX/XX/XXXX ( the {$410.00} payment ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( the {$360.00} payment ). In addition, I received my most recent billing statement from Wells Fargo via email on XX/XX/XXXX showing a balance of {$370.00}, which obviously includes the payment of $ 400+ that I had made on XX/XX/XXXX. Lastly, that billing statement has a due date of XX/XX/XXXX that I would not be able to pay on because I have "" paid too many times. '' Quite frankly, I feel as if I have been robbed. Am I being charged interest on these non-payments? The money was taken from my bank accounts but is somehow not being paid towards my credit card. Yet, it is SHOWING as being paid towards my card when I check my account. But, Wells Fargo says it isn't. So, the payment is being posted according to them but it isn't being posted? Also, will I be penalized for going over my credit limit when I have nearly {$700.00} before I reach my limit? This is ludicrous."

I contacted XXXX XXXX, the owner, and offered to send the wrong bed back. I was told not to but was assured that the right bed would be sent quickly. I believe she claimed by the end of that week or next it would be taken care of. Anywhere from several weeks to a couple of months went by with no bed showing up and no contact from her to let me know what was going on so I contacted her again and again was assured that the issue would be taken care of. In XXXX of XXXX I demanded a {$200.00} credit after no bed had arrived and I had not been contacted to be updated about what was happening. XXXX agreed to credit me within 2 weeks. I will attach a copy of that email exchange below. She claimed she had tried to contact me many times and that she had sent the bed but it was returned to her because I had moved. I never received any contact from her and have lived at the same address for around 2 decades. I have since questioned her claim that she mailed the bed by asking for the tracking number but she has not provided that to me. Around this time back in XXXX was also when COVID was starting up. There were many other priorities I had in addition to I simply didn't know what the best course of action would be against her. I am now fine with a chargeback but at the time knew that that would affect her and I was unsure of how to handle the situation. Some time went by and I ended up filing a XXXX  complaint against her. She ignored the complaint. It is now XXXX of XXXX and no {$200.00} credit or bed have ever occurred. The credit card company rejected my dispute claim because it was only 9 days over the 540 days they allow. I am contacting you in the hope that you can please get my money back from VISA. I have all of the proof you would need including like I mentioned above an email from the business this complaint is against agreeing to refund me. Simply because I opened the dispute claim 9 days over their limit they are not giving me the money I am owed. I can provide any more details that you need. Thank you greatly!

I suppose that unless this bank is charge 25 % on a balance that don't want to extend available credit. They passed me from one department to the other. No help. After numerous attempts to solve this with the bank, they proceeded to close my account. I can't help but think that this was discriminatory because of my previous inquiries. NO ETHICS! Shame on you Wells Fargo!"
4740,"My rewards Visa credit card from Wells Fargo was stolen or illegally used on XX/XX/XXXX. There was 13 transactions of a total of {$990.00} used. Unfortunately short after I reported, the bank declined the claim. I reopened the claim with a police report on XX/XX/XXXX."
4742,"Wells Fargo claims that I had a credit card with them ending in the number XXXX which for the longest time was used to monthly auto-pay an account in meal pal for XXXX. This card was on auto-pay from my savings account in wells Fargo. This went on for over 2-3 years before I even noticed it. Upon noticing, I brought it to wells Fargo 's awareness and they have done nothing to solve it. I canceled my savings account with them and all banking relationships with them. To make it worst, they sent me another credit card ending with XXXX and have started to chase us for some pending payments ( which we never incurred ). This is real harassment. We receive a call from their debt collection agency every Saturday at XXXX XXXX and a letter from them every month where we have made it amply clear to them that we have nothing to do with it. 

I am sensing that this is part of a larger fraud here and looking for help in resolving it. not sure how many other consumers might have similar issues with them.

4748,"I received a statement from Wells Fargo informing me that "" Your WELLS FARGO XXXXXXXX XXXX account with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has been sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX... '' It speaks of amendments to my credit card agreement, but I never applied for this credit card or any credit card from Wells Fargo."
4749,"On XX/XX/17 I used a 0 interest for 6 months offer from Wells Fargo and deposited {$4000.00} in my account to purchase a car. I have been charged huge account fees and interest rate when the offer was for 0 interest. I complaint 3 times and I asked for a statement that shows how the interested was calculated. All 3 times I was denied of the statement and an account representative said that the offer expired in XX/XX/XXXX. 

The 0 % interest offer was for 6 months and not for two weeks. Please instruct Wells Fargo to comply with my request for a statement that shows how the fees and interest was calculated. 

Thank you!"
4750,"XXXX made an unauthorized deduction from my checking account which caused associated overdraft. The overdraft resulted in draft from saving account and cash charges, fees, etc. to Wells Fargo credit card. Occurrence was XXXX day a three way phone call took place between XXXX and Wells Fargo. It was established that the transactions were all unauthorized. XXXX over charged interest even after receiving payments in full. XXXX has also failed to report the loans as having been paid ( in full and excess ) to the credit bureaus. Wells Fargo still has yet to reimburse the savings account and the credit card from the checking account. They sent a letter only a week after the three way call informing that all the proper adjustments had been made. Later, Wells Fargo sent another letter ( false claim ) stating the reversals were not made, and falsely claimed the checking was over drafted. The checking was not over drafted until the unauthorized transaction. I have called repeatedly. This is an online account but I am not able to communicate to Wells Fargo online or file proper disputes online and the calls have resulted in hang ups and repetitive transfers without help. I have spent hours on the phone. Wells Fargo has repeatedly been charging false daily average balances, cash fees, and false balances to the credit bureaus as well. It has been over a month. Also, no one is able to disclose how they are miscalculating the interest/fees, etc. I made no charges on my credit card the last billing cycle yet have lots of wrongful charges, fees interest and false reporting on the billing statement. No one will help. I'd like a bank investigation or Auditor to fix the account because Wells Fargo has been unable to do so. Please assist. Thank you.."
4754,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I was a victim of the XXXX  data breach and since then thieves have used my information to open various credit cards and auto loans. The account that I am referring to in this complaint is with Wells Fargo ; in XX/XX/XXXX a credit card was opened and continued to be used until the thief accumulated a debt of {$4700.00}. I have contacted the creditor and all three credit bureaus several times before the debt got this high in an effort for this account to be shut down and taken off of my credit report. And to no avail neither entity has taken any action but have consistently tried to make me pay for such debt that the thief accumulated over the years without making any payments. I refuse to pay for such debts that do not belong to me. I previously demanded from both the creditor and all 3 credit bureaus for a copy of the application submitted for this credit card in order to verify the identity of the individual that applied for it. All entities have denied my requests over several years in an effort to verify and close this account. This has negatively impacted my credit report for several years now. I have been unable to even obtain a loan to pursue secondary schooling. Please delete this account and all of its history from your systems and my credit report immediately. Attached I also included a certified mail receipt from previous letters sent to the creditor."
4755,"Wells Fargo is not offering credit to its low income account holders who have banked with Wells Fargo over 10 years or more. Wells Fargo withdrew its secured credit cards, and makes no attempt to create an alternative to the secured credit it had offered prior to XXXX. Wells Fargo does not offer any means of low income account holders or offer to discuss with low income account holders, how they may obtain credit given Wells Fargo 's existing requirements. Wells Fargo discriminates against these consumers at all of its local branches in XXXX, FL by failing to diversify its staffing, failing to hire, retain or train employees who are best suited by language or race to administer Wells Fargo credit, mortgage, commercial credit and lines of credit at its locations in XXXX, FL. 

The bank has a sad history in the city of failing to implement any type of diversity at its branches, so low income consumers are treated as if they are invisible and their credit building, access to mortgages, access to products that enable them to build, recover or obtain credit. Wells Fargo has failed its low income customers by creating preferences of customers and staffing in its locations in XXXX, FL. 

The last visit to a Wells Fargo branch in XX/XX/XXXX to its XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX branch in XXXX, FL the bank refused to cash one of it's own cashier 's checks and held the check for more than four hours while its employees and manager gave clear or reasonable explanation as to why the check was held. The bank refused to cash the check or process the transaction for between 3-4 hours. I spoke to the manager and employees there and was given no explanation as to why a Wells Fargo issued cashiers check was not cashed or deposited into a Way to Save checking account. 

Wells Fargo locations in XXXX, FL discriminate routinely against customers, and require the customer to produce so much identifying information at its branches with its sit down representatives customer 's privacy, customer dignity and customer service is totally traded for invasively aggressive practices and tactics for identifying its customers. The reps at the XXXX, FL locations have no knowledge of who their customers are, what their needs are, or the types of banking services that would benefit them. 

The local branches have failed to hire and retain diverse staff who can service all members of its community. Wells Fargo has also failed to specifically enact marketing programs to assist low incomes consumers with their consumer priorities such as to build credit, gain access to home mortgage loans, access secured credit so credit may be built back after bankruptcy. 

I have had to call the 800 line to access to routine banking that would normally be accomplished at a local branch of the bank because the staff, the reps, the sit down reps were so overly intrusive about identifying information, or did other types of offensive servicing such as refusing to cash or deposit a wells fargo issued check. The branch reps are not diversitied and therefore they are not accessible to consumer account holders to discuss planning needs, building credit, or home financing. 

Wells Fargo as a company is not marketing or making its services user friendly at its branches. Customers will be held waiting in line at the bank for an hour or longer to access basic services bc the branch does not understand efficiency and the staff who were hired do not represent a diverse group at any of the XXXX, FL branches. The services are slow, inefficient, against Wells Fargo 's own corporate policies and poorly applied at its branches in its local community."
4758,I was at my friends house for a party on XX/XX/XXXX than I woke up the next morning and my car was missing along with my Wallet when I left in the car so I I file a police report on the XXXX and then on the XXXX I found out there someone use my debit card to withdraw XXXX $ Plus they also rented a hotel room I jist want my XXXX $ dollar but Wells Fargo say they didnt find anything fraudulent. As soon as I found out my wallet was missing I report jt stolen right away I even sent them a copy of the police report. They found my car on the XXXX or XXXX I think and it was total there was nktjnf left in it so now Im out of a car and out of XXXX $! $!
4759,"I have reached out to Wells Fargo on several occasions each time I was denied a hardship application due to fact Wells Fargo refuses to provide consumer with written confirmation of their offer, then refuses to due business with any consumer that exercises their right to complaint with CFPB or seek class actions. 

I have made several attempts to seek financial assistance through Wells Fargo hardship program due to XXXX, each time during discussion if I raise any concerns or ask for written confirmation my call is transfer to their escalation department, I then placed on permeant hold, then call is disconnected and I have to repeated this process now going on ( 3 ) months. 

Wells Fargo is engaging in discriminatory business practices against XXXX XXXX selectively declining hardship application and telling consumer if we exercise our right to file complaint or seek legal assistance they will not refused to provide assistance. I spoke with a representative by the XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX refused to allow me to complete a financial hardship application, both threaten to terminate call if I filed a consumer complaint."
4760,"Due to my good credit score and history Ive been receiving many offers from banks etc.for credit cards. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo to apply for a credit card after receiving many solicitations. The offer was for a zero interest for18 months no interest on purchases and balance transfers. When I spoke to their rep I made it clear I was planning to transfer {$1800.00} to the card from another higher interest card. I also asked them specifically if they were going to be able to make a decision on my application in a timely manner. They said yes in 48-72 hrs. XX/XX/21 : After waiting nearly 3 weeks and calling them several times for a status report, I forced escalation for a decision. I was told I was denied due to a lack of proof of employment, even though Im anXX/XX/XXXX whos been temporarily displaced by the pandemic until its safe for me to return. The fact is I have some XXXX issues and I cant afford to take any chances right now. While I will not deny that Im upset about their decision, Im more disturbed by the distortion, deceit and outright lies I was told along the way down this misguided, wayward wandering and meandering path to what should have been a simple decision in 48-72 hrs as promised. The lies included telling me they called and left a message about additional requirements. My phone records indicate no call or message ever existed. Seriously? Please dont attempt to insult my intelligence with lies and distortion that I can prove are not truthful ... .disgraceful. 
Specifically heres a summary of my personal interactions with Wells Fargo : XX/XX/21 - credit card application filed via phone Told decision would take 48-72 hrs XX/XX/21 - called Wells Fargo after 5 days and no correspondence from them as promised. After being jerked around for more than 10 minutes with a representative that I had a very difficult time communicating with, and a lot of fumbling and bumbling and distortion, I was told they were still looking at the application? Once again I was told it would probably be a few more business days XX/XX/21 - called Wells Fargo credit to get a status report after more than 10 days with no communication from them. Once again a very strange disorganized and dysfunctional call where my WF rep suddenly claimed to not hear me and we were cut off somehow? I called back and was told by the rep that I now needed to provide 3 months of bank statements - which I submitted that day at the Wells Fargo bank branch XXXX, Ca with the help of a bank employee XX/XX/21 - called Wells Fargo again after no correspondence from them. The agent indicated they were still looking into it and might have more questions? At this point Im frustrated and ready for closure on the matter. 
I ask that a decision be made by next day - after waiting more than 18 calendar days for an answer that I thought was going to take a few days at most XX/XX/21 - called Wells Fargo. After waiting a long time I asked to escalate the matter to the proper department for final decision. After 38 minutes and several iterations of my rep/agent speaking back and forth to the underwriter I was told that my application was not ready? Specifically there was an issue with my stated annual income that they could not verify or something? I told them for the 4th time Im an XXXX XXXX and Ive been temporarily displaced by the pandemic. I was told they were not ready to go forward. At this point I was livid and I told them to please cancel my application. It seems nonsensical to me that Id be met with so many obstacles when its never happened to me before. In fact Ive gotten instant approval from other banks and creditors recently. I have a total debt profile of XXXX and a XXXX FICO and more than XXXX of liquid assets which I planned to leverage for better interest rates. Seemed simple and straightforward to me ... or so I thought. While I understood my acceptance was discretionary and their offer non-binding, what I take issue with is their repeated efforts to solicit XXXX XXXX. Obviously my credit profile and status was clearly targeted when they did this. Furthermore I was forced to provide my financial statements, which I now feel I need to worry about as I dont trust this institution at all. 
Fact is I currently have 5 similar offers from other banks/creditors that I could have chosen - several of which are pre-qualified. However Im most upset that my credit score has suffered with this credit inquiry because I chose the wrong offer from a bad bank and now Ill have to absorb the consequences. Take two ... 
Im writing because Ive never felt so disgusted degraded disgraced and humiliated due to a ( repeated ) lack of professionalism and incompetence. I want others to know about my experiences dealing with these sidewinders so they might avoid this institution at all cost as I should have done. Obviously their history of consumer complaints, financial indiscretions and improprieties which have led to big fines and penalties should have been a clue to avoid them but honestly I never expected it to be this bad of an experience. Trust me it was the worst. They are bad news in my opinion. Buyer beware. Do your business with a more reputable financial institution with integrity. I can assure you Ill never attempt to do business with these clowns again."
4761,"On XX/XX/2018, I logged on to Wells Fargo to pay my credit card bill. Two things distressed me : 1 ) In the payment options, they have removed the amount that is on my last statement. They only have options for minimum payments due. In the screenshot, you see {$210.00} as the "" total amount due '', but when I navigated back to a statement that wasn't visible on the payment screen, my amount due since my last balance was more than $ 4K. In my opinion, this is predatory. They are making it hard for me to pay my bill in full, hoping I'll make only the minimum payment due so they can make more money on interest charges. See attached. This is a recent change to a large lender and very troubling.

2 ) I wanted to see just how much Wells Fargo has changed me for late fees, so I searched "" late fees '' on my account activity. It returned "" no results '' even though I can see a charge in the screen shot. Again in my opinion, this large lender is hiding data about their fees thereby making it hard for me to know just how much they are costing me.

These are subtle but very concerning changes to online payment user experiences that will lead consumers to make poor decisions with regard to their credit. Wells Fargo is making fees and payment in full opaque, for their benefit."
4762,I tried to apply for a credit card at Wells Fargo but was told I can not receive a credit card because I already have accounts with Wells Fargo that were not paid as agreed. This however is not true because I have never had a credit card with any back or company ever. I believe it to be that someone has open accounts under my name or social security number which are not allowing me to apply for a credit card.
4765,"We are a small business and had a signed contract with a customer. All payments were made via the client 's credit card through XXXX. We delivered the product to the client, but it was slightly damaged during shipping. We hired a company that came to the client 's address and fixed the product at our own cost. The product ended up being upgraded and has increased its value. 

The client, however, made a chargeback of {$19000.00} on XX/XX/2021. XXXX  gave us only XXXX window to present our case and appeal the chargeback. As a matter of fact, the email XXXX sent us indicated that the money was ALREADY taken out of our bank account, without the XXXX window. 

We submitted all the paperwork to XXXX AND Wells Fargo proving that the chargeback was illegal. Stripe never followed up or requested any additional documents. The money was out of our bank account within a few hours. 

We called and email WellsFargo even prior to the chargeback, alerting them of the potential fraudulent chargeback, as the client threatened us. Wells Fargo told us to sit tight and wait for XXXX to handle this. 

We strongly believe that this was not handled properly and that we lost {$19000.00} due to the bank and the card processor 's negligence."
4767,"I woke up yesterday morning to an email from Wells Fargo asking me to rate their service on my recently completed credit card dispute. I 'd received no other notification that the dispute had been resolved, but I still have over {$100.00} of fraudulent charges on that ( now-closed ) account. Here are the facts of said dispute : 1. I am an American citizen who will be reading for a XXXX degree at the University of XXXX in the XXXX XXXX from now until XX/XX/XXXX. 
2. In early XX/XX/XXXX, upon arriving in the XXXX, I found four fraudulent charges on my credit account. All four were with the same merchant ( XXXX ), by the same individual ( evidenced by all four bearing the same mobile number, which I did not recognize ), on the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( after I 'd departed America on the XX/XX/XXXX ). 
3. I immediately disputed all four -- and one of the four was credited within minutes, before I could even upload my supporting documents. I still do n't know why the other three were n't credited at the same time, given that they were all the  same. I 've asked Wells Fargo multiple times to explain why, via multiple channels. They 've never answered. 
4. I skyped with the Fraud Department, and they confirmed the remaining three as fraud. It was a no-brainier ; I literally showed both Wells Fargo and the merchant an officially stamped visa proving I was n't in America when those charges were made. I 'd boarded a flight at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX Pacific Daylight Time on XX/XX/XXXX ; had a layover in XXXX , New Jersey ; and was outside the United States before the calendar turned. 
5. I received an email on the XX/XX/XXXX stating that "" the merchant may owe you a refund '' and that the merchant had 30 days to investigate the matter. I really can not fathom why such an investigation should require more than 30 seconds before crediting me, given the absolutely indisputable proof I provided. 
6. Yesterday I received the survey mentioned above.
7. I sent an email to Wells Fargo via their "" Secure Email '' through their website, and today I received a response that they 'd forwarded my complaint to their "" Non-Fraud '' Department. The Non-Fraud Department does not correspond by email, can only be reached via phone during "" normal '' business hours in America, and may send me something through the mail to which I must respond promptly lest I forfeit my right to dispute the charges. Wells Fargo is fully aware that I 'm not in America, have no phone service in the XXXX yet, and have only sporadic access to internet until my University IT account gets set up ( most likely some time in the next week ) ; I have communicated these facts to Wells Fargo via no fewer than three separate channels. The mailing address they have for me is my mother 's, as I was living with her before departing for the XXXX and they will not allow me to update it to my XXXX address. 

I have top-tier credit in America, with a FICO score over 800. I know this because up until I filed this dispute I was able to see my FICO score on wellsfargo.com as a perk of my XXXX Credit Account. Upon filing the dispute, I observed that the option had been removed without notice. This seemed almost like retaliation, especially given that Wells Fargo has always provided me with notice of even the most minor changes to my account. I asked Wells Fargo to explain why it was removed -- and specifically the timing, given that it coincided not only with the dispute but also with the XXXX hack -- but as was the case with only one of the four fraudulent charges being credited, they failed to answer.
I need my excellent credit, as I will need to apply for XXXX XXXX loans from the US Department of Education again next year. Those are subject credit approval. I was approved almost instantly this year, but if my credit gets damaged because of Wells Fargo 's ineptitude, it could really bite me in the XXXX next year."

This letter is being sent to you in response to notices sent to me from your company and more importantly, due to your erroneous reporting to the Credit Bureau { s }, the highly negative impact on my personal credit report. Please be advised that this is not a refusal to pay, but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 { b } that your claim is disputed and validation is requested. 

This is NOT a request for verification or proof of my mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above named Title and Section. I respectfully request that your offices provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay you. 

Please provide me with the following : What the money you say I owe is for : Explain and show me how you calculated what you say I owe : Provide me with copies of any papers that show I agreed to pay what you say I owe : Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable : Identify the original creditor : Prove the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account : Show me the you are licensed to collect in my state : Provide me with your license numbers and Registered Agent or Agent of Service : At this time I will also inform that if offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus { XXXX, XXXX or XXXX } this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact, if any negative mark is found on any of my credit reports by theses companies, I will not hesitate to bring legal action against you for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Defamation of Character If your offices are able to provide proper documentation as requested in the following Declaration, I will require at least 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist. 

Since youve obviously neglected to investigate this account thoroughly I am demanding you remove this account off my profile. It is at this time that I will point out the in XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX et, the courts ruled each and every time that the CRA couldnt merely Parrot information from the creditors and collection agencies that they have conduct an independent REASONABLE investigation to ensure the validity of the debt and honesty/integrity of the creditors/CA in question. Sending out a generic form through the XXXX system that doesnt even contain my reasons for the dispute is not reasonable. 


Which Im sure you are aware each violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act allows damages of {$1000.00} should this matter ends up in court. 
I look forward to an expedite resolution of this matter Thank you. 


Also, during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with my legal counsel for suit. This includes listing any information with a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated or verifying an account as accurate, when it fact there is no provided proof that it is accurate. 

If your company fails to respond to this validation request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from my credit report and a copy of such deletion { to any/all of the 3 major credit reporting bureaus : XXXX, XXXX and XXXX } request shall be sent to me immediately. 

I would also like to request, in writing, that no telephone contact be made by your company to my home or my place of employment. If your offices attempt telephone communication with me, including but not limited to computer generated calls and calls or correspondence sent to or with any third parties, it will be considered harassment and I will have no choice but to file suit. All future communications with me MUST be done in writing and sent to the address noted in this letter by XXXX.

4770,"Time after time, since XX/XX/XXXX, COVID-19 Pandemic, as a XXXX XXXX XXXX long time customer, who has written letters, Emails, phone calls to plead for help because WF had agreed with the federal govt, and state gov't to help their customers who ask for help, and I believed that. After two hardship letters to XXXX XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX WF, and Email pleadings, to lower their punitive interest rate, they refuse. A PUNITIVE {$80.00} plus per month could help pay for my utilities, food, etc. WF claims they help people and are equitable. I see no equity in their practices. I see some age. and marital status discriminatory practices. 

Even my credit union has helped my out. Shame on Wells Fargo, for letting their elderly customers, suffer more harm by not even going our of their way to help. 

I can understand why WF is involved in so many class action lawsuits. WF did not even help me out when I wanted to refinance my home where WF held the mortgage of XX/XX/XXXX years. A divorce. AfterXX/XX/XXXX years with no alimony put me in a financial hardship. After filling out their application, which was an invitation from WF to refinance my home at a lower mortgage rate, WF put me through a futile exercise of paying the mortgage for XX/XX/XXXX months ( in 2015 ) on my own, which I complied with, which resulted in turning me down, and I had to sell my home. 

Fast forward to COVID-19 Pandemic, they are still denying help to me, a XXXX XXXX XXXX long time customer. These punitive actions on WF 's part should be addressed. Age and Marital status in my opinion, is not being dealt with equitably or justly by WF."
4771,"I have Wells Fargo Visa Credit card. As per the terms after spending $ XXX within 60/90 days one will get $ YY as the cash rewards. I have {$210.00}. When i tried to redeem it - it 's only letting me redeem in the multiples of {$25.00}. I want to redeem all. Trying to work with Wells Fargo since XX/XX/XXXX regarding this issue. They asked me to reach out to the Rewards Center ( 3rd party ) but they are also not willing to write me a check of {$210.00} and send it to me.
Nowhere it 's mentioned in the card member agreement that rewards can be redeemed only in the multiples of {$25.00}. Moreover other banks and credit cards also does n't follow what Wells is doing."
4772,"In the last year I have become a victim of identity theft. I have faxed letters, sent certified copies of letters and mailed letters to inform Wells Fargo Bank I am a victim of identity theft and a bank account and secured credit card was opened fraudulently in my name using my social security number. I sent them a copy of the FCRA 's Notice to furnishers of information and asked them what their process was for victims of identity theft. They should have proper guidelines in place to deal with matters like this. 

My experience has been unpleasant and very hard. After I contacted the XXXX to dispute the negative inaccurate information being reported from Wells Fargo I received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX outlining an investigation of facts that are just not true. There is no truth to any of the facts outlined by XXXX XXXX at Wells Fargo Executive Offices. She is making bold claims of me applying for accounts at Wells Fargo branch locations, making payments to accounts I never had and opening secured credit cards from accounts I never had. They sent me a copy of an application contains my first and last name, annual income and a fraudulent signature that is not mine. I repeat, the signature they are using to verify me to these accounts is not my signature. 

I sent Wells Fargo a letter disputing the accounts and informing them the accounts had been opened up as a result of fraud/identity theft. I also made clear I wanted them to stop reporting accounts to XXXX that had been opened as a result of identity theft and that the information need to be deleted from my credit file at the soonest time possible otherwise Wells Fargo could face hefty fines for not following the law. I also made a identity theft report and filed an FTC report and gave Wells Fargo a copy of the reports. 

Here is a letter I sent to Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX : : : : XX/XX/XXXX Case # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Alabama XXXX Wells Fargo Bank NA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX IA XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX, I am in receipt of your letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. I tried calling twice and left voicemails, but the calls were unreturned. Thank you for addressing this urgent matter. 

You should know After carefully reviewing your letter, I can confirm I am not the listed owner of this account. I encourage you to re-investigate the facts you have stated in your letter. 

Account Opening - Your letter states that the account was opened on XX/XX/XXXX after I submitted an application at a Wells Fargo Bank location and you enclosed a copy of the signed application for my review. It is my claim I have never stepped foot in a Wells Fargo Bank location to apply for a bank account or secured credit card. This simply did not happen. 
Furthermore, the signed application you sent On XX/XX/XXXX does in fact have a signature, however upon careful review it is NOT MY SIGNATURE. The signature on your application is fraudulent. It is not my signature. My correct signature can be found on the letter and FTC identity theft affidavit I sent on XX/XX/XXXX and faxed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Secured collateral - I have never had a bank account with Wells Fargo Bank. If any account did exist it was the result of identity theft and should be treated as such. Enclosed is a copy of the obligations of furnishers under the FCRA Notice to Furnishers of Information. Please read the notice and govern yourself according to the law. 

Lost/Stolen - On XX/XX/XXXX you claim I reported a card lost/stolen and a new card was issued and sent to me. It is my claim I have never had an account or reported a card lost/stolen with Wells Fargo Bank. This did not happen. You also claim cards were mailed to me at addresses I have never lived in my entire life. The addresses these cards were sent to were addresses I have never been associated with. The addresses you sent the cards to are : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Georgia XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Georgia XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Georgia XXXX I have never lived at any of these addresses. Or received mail at any of these addresses. These addresses are a result of fraud. 

Transactions - I have never had a bank account or secured card account with Wells Fargo Bank, therefore I have never made any purchases or payments at any Wells Fargo Bank locations. If an online payment was made with an account in my name it is the result of identity theft and should be treated as such. 
Please send me the appropriate documentation to address the matter of having a bank account opened fraudulently in my name. 

Account Closed - After reviewing my credit report and seeing the fraudulent account opened I sent a written request to close the account and remove it from my credit file at the soonest time possible. 

Should you have any additional questions regarding my claim please contact me directly at XXXX. I am available 7 days a week from XXXX until XXXX Eastern Time.

4783,"Approximately two ( 2 ) years ago I opened a Wells Fargo credit card. 

This card was primarily for the purpose of a balance transfer. 

After I paid off the entire balance, I requested that the account be closed. 

The account was always paid in a timely fashion, and my credit in general is excellent. 

I received a letter from Wells Fargo indicating that "" ... we have closed your credit card account for the reasons listed below .... 

-- Total monthly payment ( s ) due for bankcard or line of credit account ( s ) on credit report is high -- -No wells fargo checking or savings account -- -Over six months Account inactivity From reading this letter any one would assume that wells fargo initiated the closing of the account due to the above reasons, some of which are negative. 

I do not want any negative statements regarding this closure, which I requested, to be listed on my credit card. 

The appearance is that Wells Fargo is "" punishing '' me for closing my account. 

Conditions 1 and 2 existed when the account was approved and opened, and the account was inactive after it was initially opened for a period of approximately 18 months I guess that up until relatively recently # 2 would not have been true since they probably would have opened an account in my name without my permission I should have received a letter from them confirming that my request to close my account was approved, not a letter indicating that as some sort of review of my account it was being closed. 

I request and expect a written response from Wells Fargo explaining their actions in this matter and an explanation as to how they will rectify any negative entries on my credit card."
4784,"On my checking account, Well Fargo withdraw : XX/XX/XXXX amounts {$720.00} XX/XX/XXXX amounts {$1500.00} XX/XX/XXXX amounts {$6700.00} XX/XX/XXXX amounts {$1500.00} On my saving account XX/XX/XXXX amounts {$1000.00} XX/XX/XXXX amounts {$2300.00} I can not pay the amounts for my personal credit card then I check on my business bank account, Well Fargo withdraw money from my business bank account. According to legal adviser and Fair credit reporting act, Well Fargo do n't have authority to withdraw money from my business bank account."
4787,This account is already PAID with no balance.
4789,"In summary, this narrative concerns Wells Fargo 's payment allocation practices on a personal credit card with multiple promotional rate balances with identical terms that expire at different times. Wells Fargo distributes payments among all of the balances in a manner deliberately engineered to make it impossible to pay off the balance expiring the soonest prior to expiration without also paying off the entire account in full. In addition, several payments were egregiously applied primarily to the newest balance ( i.e. the last to expire ). 

Clearly this is designed to maximize Wells Fargo 's opportunity to generate income on transactions of this nature. When a consumer is forced to pay the total account balance to avoid interest charges on one balance expiring sooner than others, it also effectively revokes the duration of the promotional period promised for each transaction posting to the account after the initial one. These payment allocation practices were not described in any disclosures, on the credit access devices ( "" Superchecks '' ), on the statements, or in the terms and conditions of the account. Although there is presently no law in place to govern how payments are allocated when all balances on a credit card account are at the same interest rate, Wells Fargo is not in line with its peers ( the other three "" Big Banks '' ), which apply payments to multiple same-rate balances either in the order they post to an account or the order in which they expire. 

In detail, I conducted a total of five transactions with identical terms ( 15 months at 0 % with a 4 % transaction fee ) for varying dollar amounts on separate occasions. No other transactions have taken place on the account aside from fourteen timely payments totaling {$2300.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ). It was when I made this XX/XX/XXXX payment that I discovered how payments had been applied to the account. 

Here is the complete chronological breakdown per the figures shown on each statement. Payment # 4 shows nothing going to the newest balance, but payment # s 5, 6, and 7 demonstrate where most of the payment is nefariously applied to the newest balance. 

Balance # 1 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$4100.00}, expiring XX/XX/XXXX Balance # 2 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$1000.00}, expiring XX/XX/XXXX Payment # 1 -  XX/XX/XXXX for {$350.00} : {$280.00} to balance # 1, {$70.00} to balance # 2 Payment # 2 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$170.00} and Payment # 3 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$170.00} ( same billing cycle ) : {$280.00} to balance # 1, {$70.00} to balance # 2 Balance # 3 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$1500.00}, expiring XX/XX/XXXX Payment # 4 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$360.00} : {$280.00} to balance # 1, {$72.00} to balance # 2, {$0.00} to balance # 3 Payment # 5 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} : {$23.00} to balance # 1, {$5.00} to balance # 2, {$70.00} to balance # 3 Balance # 4 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$1500.00}, expiring XX/XX/XXXX Payment # 6 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00} : {$64.00} to balance # 1, {$16.00} to balance # 2, {$29.00} to balance # 3, {$89.00} to balance # 4 Balance # 5 - XX/XX/XXXX for {$2000.00}, expiring XX/XX/XXXX Payment # 7, XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00} : {$43.00} to balance # 1, {$10.00} to balance # 2, {$19.00} to balance # 3, {$19.00} to balance # 4, {$100.00} to balance # 5 Payment # 8, XXXX for {$140.00} : {$50.00} to balance # 1, {$12.00} to balance # 2, {$22.00} to balance # 3, {$22.00} to balance # 4, {$31.00} to balance # 5 Payment # 9, XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} : {$35.00} to balance # 1,  {$9.00} to balance # 2, {$16.00} to balance # 3, {$16.00} to balance # 4, {$22.00} to balance # 5 Payment # 10, XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} : {$35.00} to balance # 1, {$9.00} to balance # 2, {$16.00} to balance # 3, {$16.00} to balance # 4, {$22.00} to balance # 5 Payment # 11, XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} : {$35.00} to balance # 1, {$9.00} to balance # 2, {$16.00} to balance # 3, {$16.00} to balance # 4, {$22.00} to balance # 5 Payment # 12, XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} : {$35.00} to balance # 1, {$9.00} to balance # 2, {$16.00} to balance # 3, {$16.00} to balance # 4, {$22.00} to balance # 5 Payment # 13, XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} : {$35.00} to balance # 1, {$9.00} to balance # 2, {$16.00} to balance # 3, {$16.00} to balance # 4, {$22.00} to balance # 5 Payment # 14, XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} : {$35.00} to balance # 1, {$9.00} to balance # 2, {$16.00} to balance # 3, {$16.00} to balance # 4, {$22.00} to balance # 5 Payment # 15, XX/XX/XXXX for {$100.00} : To be determined on XX/XX/XXXX statement As of the XX/XX/XXXX statement, only {$1200.00} ( or 54.17 % of all payments ) has been applied to balance # 1, bringing it from {$4100.00} to {$2900.00}. Had payments been allocated as I anticipated, balance # 1 would instead be {$1800.00}, and the other balances would remain at their original dollar amounts. 

After reviewing all statements, Wells Fargo 's website, and 12 CFR Part 1026 ( Regulation Z ), 1026.53 Allocation of payments, I contacted Wells Fargo by phone on XX/XX/XXXX to determine 1 ) whether they accept requests to allocate payments in a specific way, 2 ) whether there is a written policy in place governing how payments are allocated when there are multiple balances at the same interest rate, and 3 ) whether a research request could be submitted to retroactively reallocate previously posted payments. 

I spoke with three Wells Fargo associates and was able to determine only that Wells Fargo does not accept requests for specific methods of payment allocation. The first associate offered the solution of waiting until the day after the promotion expired to make a payment, invoking the CARD act 's payment order rules regarding balances at different interest rates. This action would still allow any remaining balance to be subject to interest. It also does not address that the remaining balance would be higher than anticipated due to the allocation method. The third associate, in the "" executive office, '' was not able to locate a policy regarding payment allocation for multiple balances at the same interest rate and could not confirm whether payments could be reallocated. I specified to this associate that had I been aware of how payments would be allocated and, with no option to modify this, I would choose to conduct only one transaction. I informed this associate that I would be submitting the case to the CFPB. The associate provided a phone number and case number and advised that I would be contacted at a future date. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called requesting a status update on my case. The associate advised that it could take "" up to a month '' for a response. As of this submission on XX/XX/XXXX - over five weeks since my initial contact - I have not received a response, and there are just over four weeks remaining until the first balance is set to expire. 

In the meantime, I conducted additional research and was able to locate numerous other posted CFPB complaints from consumers who faced the same/similar issue with Wells Fargo ( the complaint numbers are : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, perhaps among others ), and also located a potentially relevant description of payment allocation on Wells Fargo 's website. 

The description, located at https : //retailservices.wellsfargo.com/customer/faqs.html, states : "" Your payment applies first to the minimum payment due ( including past due amounts ) for that billing cycle. Anything over the minimum payment due generally applies first to No Interest if Paid in Full ( deferred interest ) promotions in the last two billing cycles before the expiration date of the promotion ( when applicable ) ; then to regular term balances with the highest APR to the lowest APR ; and then to all other sub-accounts based on expiration date. If you'd like to know how payments apply to your specific account, call us at XXXX, Monday - Friday, XXXX XXXX  to XXXX XXXX Central Time. '' It is unclear whether this policy applies only to Wells Fargo 's co-branded retail cards and does not define the term "" sub-account. '' It does indicate in this instance that payments can be applied "" based on the expiration date. '' However, it also implies that "" your specific account '' may have an entirely different set of payment allocation parameters than another. But lastly and perhaps most importantly, it provides that a consumer is able to determine how payments apply to a specific account. Wells Fargo was thus far unable to do this, aside from reiterating the basic provisions of the CARD act.

Wells Fargo may currently be in compliance with the law, but the payment allocation practices described in detail here are, I feel objectively, both abusive and deceptive to consumers. At a minimum, Wells Fargo should be able to explain their methodology when asked ( per  their own language quoted above ). At a minimum, the CFPB should require notification that payments can be applied in no or any particular fashion when there are only multiple same-rate balances on a credit card account. 

A secondary, unrelated issue also became apparent while poring over my account. To my knowledge, this did not impact me directly, and I did not bring it to Wells Fargo 's attention, but I believe this should be made known. Several of my statements were not consistent with the Minimum Payment calculation as specified in the account agreement : "" Minimum Payment. Your Minimum Payment Due includes any amount past due plus the greater of : - The sum of late, returned check, returned payment, rush plastic, and annual fees and interest billed during the Billing Cycle for which the Minimum Payment is calculated plus 1 % of the New Balance shown on the billing statement ; or - {$25.00} ( or the entire balance on the Account if the New Balance is less than {$25.00} ). '' Examples : - the minimum due for XX/XX/XXXX, on a 0 % balance of {$5200.00}, was {$250.00}. 
- the minimum due for XX/XX/XXXX, on a 0 % balance of {$4800.00}, was {$97.00}. 
- the minimum due for XX/XX/XXXX, on a 0 % balance of {$4500.00}, was {$90.00}. 

The minimum due for XX/XX/XXXX appears to be 1 % of the balance plus the dollar amount of the transaction fees associated with the first two balance transfers ( {$160.00} and {$40.00} ). These fees are included in the 0 % interest balance and should not have been included in the minimum due. Subsequent transaction fees were not included in the minimum due following the closing of those statement cycles ( for example, the XX/XX/XXXX balance transfer of {$2000.00} had a transaction fee of {$80.00}, which was not added to the minimum due for XX/XX/XXXX ). Then, the minimums due for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX represent 2 % of the balance rather than 1 %. It is not apparent why these three billing cycles required higher minimums due, when all following statements to present day are in alignment with the posted formula."
4791,"I received an email from Wells Fargo saying that a credit card I did not order had been shipped to an address I didnt recognize. I was able to call Wells Fargo and cancel the card before any charges were applied. They informed me that someone was able to add themselves to my account. The fraudulant name and address to receive this card is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX . XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, KY My hope is that you'll be able to stop this person from attempting this in the future."
4792,"In XXXX of XXXX, I tried to apply for a card at 0 % interest for 18 months from my bank, Wells Fargo in order to set up a new office for my business. I got the run-around for weeks because they insisted the address on my account did not match the address with the XXXX. Finally, they offered to resolve this by giving me {$10000.00} XXXX XXXX at 0 % on my already-established WF credit card for 18 months. This seemed to solve my need so I agreed. For the past 2 months I have noticed significant interest charges on this card ( over $ XXXX for a total now of over {$600.00}. ) While I had been making additional purchases with the card ( beyond the {$10000.00} @ 0 % ) I had also been making large payments to cover the new charges, along with the minimum payment for the {$10000.00} cash advance. I could n't understand why I was getting charged so much interest so I contacted their customer service. According to them, and unbeknowst to me, they had been dividing my monthly payments ( somehow?! ) towards both my new charges AND the {$10000.00} ( which was supposed to be @ 0 % for 18 mo ) rather than applying my monthly towards the higher interest ( new ) charges as well as the minimum payment on the {$10000.00} cash advance. Essentially, now, four months into my 18 months of 0 % interest, they are claiming that I have paid off close to {$9000.00} of the balance that was at 0 %, while meanwhile my accruing new charges in the amount of close to {$15000.00}. It seems incredibly unethical and deceptive for a bank to take it upon themselves to apply portions of payments to a lower-interest-rate-balance when there are higher-interest-rate charges to be paid. This was not disclosed to me and to this day I do now know how they are calculating which percentage of my payments are being applied towards the 0 % cash advance. When I spoke with them on Monday, they insisted there was nothing that could be done."
4795,"My is with Wells Fargo on a closed credit account. My challenge is getting Wells Fargo to work with me on a closed credit card account with a remaining outstanding balance at a time when I am experiencing financial and medical hardships. I have been speaking with bank representatives from months. I have written to the office of the President. I am seeking a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment amount and a special repayment program due to an ongoing battle with XXXX, financial, economic and medical hardship ; There is no uniform regulation, policy, process or guidelines on working with banks and credit card companies on trying to work with them on lowering interest rates, lowering monthly payments or any special help or assistance when going through financial and medical hardship. Working with Wells Fargo I have reached out to many representatives many times. 

In comparison to my experience with Wells Fargo trying for assistance working with XXXX XXXX XXXX on the exact same situation my experience with a XXXX XXXX XXXX account as been as different as night and day. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX worked quickly, effectively and compassionately resolving the matter by lowering the interest rate on my account with them from high double digits to 1.75 %. This meant as there rep stated I would have a realistic chance to succeed in paying off the balance on the account because the interest would not keep on piling more debt on making the balance on the account go higher and higher. XXXX XXXX XXXX 's rep asked ME to provide a payment amount I could afford to make monthly and then set an agreed upon monthly payment withing {$5.00} of that amount. Because XXXX XXXX XXXX put me in this Special Repayment Program I am successfully making regular payments and on my way to paying off the account The Wells account is under my name and social security number. It is for a closed account for my former work from home business, which is closed, The account in question is closed. I have been reaching out as frequently as weekly and/or several times a month to Wells Fargo representative, XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have repeatedly gone into detail on the Special Repayment Program I have with XXXX XXXX XXXX and had asked for the same with Wells Fargo. 

We have discussed that for roughly 3 years I have been battling XXXX physically, financially and emotionally. I have consulted more than 8 doctors and specialists. I have changed doctors 3 times. I have been seen at and received services from more than 9 different hospitals, clinics and medical facilities. I have had more than 7 XXXX. My treatment and monitoring is ongoing. I have had more than 30 XXXX XXXX. I have been and I am continually impacted by all of the above including medical side effects, daily pain, loss of work, ongoing and mounting medical bills. We have discussed that I am only partially employed on a temp basis as a XXXX XXXX. We have discussed mounting medical bills, we have discussed juggling to stave off loss of my home and being in arrears on my mortgage. 

In my desperation I discussed the voluntary sale of my daughter 's car to pay on the debt but XXXX, the Wells Fargo rep advised against the sale as apparently the proceeds from the sale of the car would not be financially sufficiently beneficial to Wells Fargo. 

The Wells Fargo required minimum payment of {$400.00} per month combined with an interest rate in the HIGH double digits, that continues to compound and increase the balance on the account, dooms me to failure, dooms me to no successful outcome"
4799,"I requested redemption of cash reward points from Wells Fargo valued at {$77.00}, They have documentation that says you can only redeem earned points at {$25.00} intervals so they only sent me {$75.00}. How this passes as ethical is beyond me. If I earned the points and they have a monetary value how is it ethical that they restrict redemption to an abitrary {$25.00} amount. How much money are they saving when customers cancel their cards or die and relatives cancel the cards? Granted the amounts lost would not exceed {$24.00} yet they say it was earned by the customer by using the Wells Fargo card who assigned the value of the points. If it is earned then it is owned by the individuals that earned it. What are the odds that you will ever have an exact {$25.00} increment when redeeming points? I contacted the company and they sent me the rules and when I tried to contact the "" XXXX '' man and has not returned my call. This occurred around XX/XX/2021. It's a small amount of money that's involved, however this could reap thousands of dollars for Wells Fargo 's Rewards program over time at their customers expense."
4800,"Wells Fargo charged us excessive interest, by a misleading process where there was a payment delay - by Wells Fargo ; Wells intentionally takes up to 2 billing cycles to process the initial payment, putting the consumer behind in payments.
We bought an engagement ring at a local jeweler, about {$1500.00} worth, and used our new Wells card to pay for it. 

The program they offer is called "" Jewelry Advantage ''. It is a XXXX card, dedicated to one Jewelry store. We opened such an account. They advertise that if you pay off the charge within 6 months, there is no interest. However, we ran over by 1 month, through no fault of our own - so they charged us interest. 

It sounds simple but Wells has set this up in an extremely deceptive way. They ask for your routing and account numbers, so they can 'pull ' the payments in an automated way. 

Here is the problem : they take up to XXXXWO FULL BILLING CYCLES to pull the first payment. This puts the consumer behind - potentially right from their first payment!
What is worse, is we did in fact notice we were behind ; we called Wells Fargo, the rep said he would fix it ; by taking a payment right then on the phone, and then the payments would 'sync up ' and we would be fine. We did exactly as he said, but we still ran over - it never sync 'd up.
Obviously the consumer can check over and over ... but when you deal with a bank as big as Wells Fargo, you want to have some trust. There is no reason to take up to two full billing cycles to pull an EFT payment. Everyone deals with EFT. It can be fully transacted within 4 days, sometimes as fast as 2 days. 

Our interaction with Wells - which was extensive, including several senior ( VP ) people - gives me the very strong impression that this design is intentional. They want the consumer to fall behind, so they can collect more interest.
Wells Fargo has found yet one more way to fraudulently collect excessive interest from consumers."
4802,"I opened a Wells Fargo Platinum credit card with an initial credit line of {$7500.00}. 
I made charges of {$7500.00}. 
I set up through Wells Fargo 's mobile app a linked checking account from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
I got my bill, and set payment of {$1500.00}. My XXXX checking account was debited {$1500.00}. 
A couple of days later I went to use the card, and was told I was at my credit limit. 
I called Wells Fargo, they said they were holding the funds before crediting the account. They held the funds for over a week before crediting the account, even though on my Wells app it showed I had {$1500.00} of credit capacity. The Wells rep stated if I had a Wells Fargo checking account the credit would have occurred immediately after the ACH hit. But since I was not with Wells, the funds from the ACH were being held, and not credited. 
The representative was strongly suggesting I now open a Wells account so I would not be penalized with having my funds held. 
I told them, no, thank you, I have never heard of this sort of practice and I would pay off the account and close it. 
I went to the app to pay off the remaining {$6500.00}. I entered the amount, selected my XXXX checking account as the funding source. The app told me they could not process the transaction. 
I called Wells, and was told they will only process {$5000.00} in payments, and I could not pay off the account from the Wells Fargo app. 
I asked if they could do it over the phone, and they said this one time they would do it. 
I closed the account. 
Not allowing someone to pay off a balance, unheard of, and think of what it could lead to : Increased interest, as it is calculated daily, increased fees, if you are not allowed to pay your balance off, etc. etc. Wells Fargo has been a bad actor for some time, and they are back at it and this time, given what just happened, the penalties need to be far more serious. They have not learned from the errors of their ways, and should be severely punished."
4808,I opened a store credit card XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX worth {$4900.00} through Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo closed my credit card without any notices or explanation. I have no documentation from the company as to why my account was closed. The company closed my account between XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted the company XX/XX/XXXX to see why it was closed but they refused to give me any explanation. I didnt owe a balance. When I did have a balance I paid my bill on time ( sometimes ) early. They did offer they can file a dispute so that the account can be removed from my credit but has yet to do so. It has been months since I last spoken to that company and nothing was ever done. The closed account still remains on my credit. I will never get a credit card with Wells Fargo ever again. They are extremely unprofessional.
4809,"On or around XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased several furniture items from XXXX XXXX store in XXXX, Illinois. When my financing application was approved, I realized that XXXX customers finance accounts are being serviced by Wells Fargo ( WF ). Had I been advised prior to the transaction, I would have declined the financing and credit from Wells Fargo. 

After I purchased and received the furniture from XXXX, I then expected to receive a monthly statement from WF. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received my first statement from WF for the purchased items from XXXX. I was surprised when I noticed that my first statement has a past due amount of {$40.00} and a late charge of {$27.00}. I immediately called WFs customer service after XXXX ( CST ) on XX/XX/XXXX to notify them of the error, but the automated voice instructed me to call during business hours. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at around XXXX, I called WFs customer service again and the call was routed to the XXXX. I spoke with a gentleman named XXXX who agreed to waive the late charge as long as I pay the past due balance. I refused to pay the past due balance noting that there should not be any past due balance on my account because the account is new and it is the first monthly statement. In addition, I asked that the late charge be removed immediately including the derogatory notation of a past due charge indicated on the account. 

Further, I also declined to provide my personal, sensitive information to an offshore WF representative for fear of identity theft and potential misuse of my personal information. I told the offshore representative that I prefer to set up a WF account online and pay there instead in order to make a record of my payment. I have every intention of paying my debt to XXXX through WF and will pay said debt as long the amount and records are accurate. I attached a copy of my first bill from WF with the account number and my address redacted for security reasons. Please investigate on this matter and contact me for any additional information you may require to assist you."
4811,"On XX/XX/21, Wells Fargos credit department took {$5700.00} from my Wells Fargo checking account, resulting in my account being over drafted by {$2900.00}. At the time of writing this, my account is XXXX. Wells Fargo Executives confirmed that this auto payment was taken in error as I had turned off auto payment on XX/XX/21. 

This morning, my family and I were stranded in Florida as we were attempting to gas up and return to our GA home from vacation. At XXXX XXXX, my card declined and I reviewed my account and saw the error. I promptly contacted Wells Fargo and proceeded to speak with no less than 10 representatives, ranging from tellers to Execs over the course of the day. Every person quoted a 3-10 day TAT to resolve an issue they confirmed was theirs. This is unacceptable for an issue this urgent. Just to get home, I had to use the same credit card that is the root of the issue just to get my family home.

Multiple reps lead me to believe I caused this issue before the Exec team proved this to be untrue. The Exec team has provided no assurances to when I will get my funds back. One rep, who I can provide details on if needed, stopped answering my calls which I advised I would make to check in for updates. At XXXX XXXX, this rep obviously started sending my calls to voicemail. I called seven times in a row from my number and each attempt was sent to voicemail. Suspecting my calls were being screened, I called the same Wells Fargo Exec number from my wifes phone, and it was answered on the second ring by the rep I had been trying to reach. How can I trust a business to keep their word on expediting a complaint when they screen my calls? Again, this was a confirmed Wells Fargo issue that wiped out my account. At the least, they owed me updates and transparency.

With Well Fargos history of fraudulent practices, I have no faith that anyone actually worked to expedite and resolve my issue. I have no money in my account and have mortgage and bills to pay today. 

I am pursuing every path I can to report Wells Fargo for their suspicious business activity."
4812,"On XX/XX/XXXX subject used my personal information to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to have replacement card shipped to an address other than mine - XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, OH XXXX.

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX I was notified by text message that Wells Fargo had received these charges. I immediately telephoned Wells Fargo and stated that these charges were not mine, request an investigation into the fraudulent charges and requested that the account be closed. It was n't until XX/XX/XXXX that I received a message on my online bank account notifying me that on Wells Fargo had shipped a replacement card to an alternate address in XXXX, OH. I do not recognize this address and have never been to XXXX, OH. On XX/XX/XXXX I filled a police report with my home town XXXX XXXX Police - Case number XXXX reporting the identity fraud. On XX/XX/XXXX I  received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX that they rejected my claim that these credit card charges were fraudulent and that I was responsible for their repayment."
4814,"My company performed several thousands of dollars of work on a vehicle owned by a Wells Fargo account holder, XXXX XXXX XXXX. Our investigation revealed the fact that XXXX XXXX is a state and federal convicted felon, XXXX XXXXXXXX, fraudster, identity thief and XXXX XXXX person. XXXX XXXX fraudulently disputed the sum of {$2300.00} on his Wells Fargo debit card. Wells Fargo found in our favor, however XXXX XXXX paid a Wells Fargo employee at the branch to reopen the claim. Wells Fargo unlawfully reopened the claim and ultimately unlawfully charged the funds back to my company XXXX XXXX XXXX. The actions of Wells Fargo violate XXXX Policy in that the claim was found in our favor and fraudulently reopened. We are attaching several pieces of evidence and invoices of work done."
4816,"Dear Sir, My name is XXXX XXXX. 

I have a Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that I use daily when needed. 

In XXXX I made my payment of {$100.00} to Well Fargo, my payment was due the same day I paid my credit card. I was having some hardship due to COVID. 

In the XXXX statement, Well Fargo charged me a late fee of {$29.00}. I called Wells Fargo and explained that I was having some hardship due to COVID and that is why I paid my bill the day it was due. Wells Fargo refused to waive and forgive the late fee.

I am writing to you to ask for your help in this matter.

I always pay my bill on time and I always pay way more than what is due. I believe Wells Fargo should be able to forgive the late fee, Most of the American people are having hardship due to COVID, and credit cards company should not charge us late fees because we paid our bill one day late.
I need your help in getting Wells Fargo to waive or forgive the late fee of {$29.00}.

I am not asking to suspend any payment, just waive the late fee.

Thank you."
4819,"This issue is on a Wells Fargo XXXX : 1. I had a {$25.00} minimum payment due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
2. I made a payment of {$100.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which they did n't apply to my card. 
3. I made a payment of {$650.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which they did n't apply to my card. 
4. I made a payment of {$100.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which they did n't apply to my card. 
5. I made a payment of {$25.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which they did n't apply to my card. 
6. I made a payment of {$34.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which they didnt apply to my card. 
7. I made a payment of {$7.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which they didnt apply to my card. 
8. I was then charged a {$50.00} late payment fee on that {$25.00} minimum payment that was due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 

This makes no sense to me no matter how they try to explain it. Basically my payments were too early even though they were all paid in the same month. I paid {$920.00} towards my credit card balance all in the month of XXXX when I only had a {$25.00} minimum payment due for XXXX, but somehow they were able to charge me a {$50.00} late fee. 

I pay my bills the first week of the month, I can not understand how my payments do not count towards whatever I have due in that same month. This is absurd. It seems like just another way Wells Fargo is fleecing the consumer."
4820,"This last year, XXXX XXXX, I took a trip to XXXX with my friends. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX we went to a small textile shop where they sold shirts, rugs, linens and such. I bought myself a couple of silk shirts for {$110.00} using a Wells Fargo Credit Card. The store ran the card and had me sign the receipt. When I returned home, I noticed on my statement that there was an additional transaction for {$2600.00} which I had not made. I contacted the fraud department at Wells Fargo bank and was eventually told that they denied my claim for fraud. They had reviewed the transactions and the receipts and claimed that I had made the transaction since my signature was on both receipts. I requested copies of the receipts and clearly I did not sign the receipt for {$2600.00}. The signature was not mine. I tried explaining this to the bank but they still denied my claim. I am amazed that the bank, which has my signature on file and on various documents, could n't come to the same conclusion regarding the nature of the fraudulent signature. I made various attempts to which the bank refused to help me. I have sent letters to the bank signed by the friends that were with me testifying that no such transaction was made by myself. I myself testify under perjury that I made no such transaction."
4821,"In Mid-XX/XX/XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a credit card account with Wells Fargo on the internet website wellsfargo.com. My husband did the same. Both applications were submitted within twenty-four hours of each other and for the same credit card type ( "" Wells Fargo Cash Wise VISA Signature Card ' ). The information submitted with the applications included the same address and telephone number. Both of us received letters from XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, IA, XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX, that acknowledged our applications and stated that : We can approve your application if we are able to verify certain information by XX/XX/XXXX. 
What you need to do Please call us by XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ... 

When we called that number, we were told that Wells Fargo needed to verify our identities. We were directed to visit a Wells Fargo Bank branch and present a government ID plus non-Wells Fargo financial account information plus vehicle registration or insurance information, all in our name in order to satisfy the Wells Fargo identity verification process. We complied with the request by jointly visiting the Wells Fargo Bank branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, California, on XX/XX/XXXX. We presented the requested documents. All documents showed our correct names and our correct address. Copies of all documents were faxed from the branch office to another Wells Fargo office by the bank employee, XXXX XXXX. 

Two days later, I received a letter from Wells Fargo Bank, XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX, that stated : ... After another careful review, we are not able to approve your application at this time. 
About your application We are unable to offer you a credit card account because : Identity ca n't be verified. 

When I called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX, to inquire whether they had made an error the representative told me that there was no error and that Well Fargo 's decision with respect to this matter was final. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another letter from Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX, that confirmed Wells Fargo 's decision. 
My husband also called Wells Fargo. He was told his application was approved and that no error had been made. He received a confirmation letter from Wells Fargo XXXX, datedXX/XX/XXXX, that stated Thank you for opening a new Wells Fargo Credit Card account. Your credit card, ... .., will be arriving soon .... 
Shortly thereafter, he received his Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa Signature credit card and used it. 

Please note that there was no derogatory information on my credit reports, that my credit score was not substantially different from my husband 's, and that there was no substantial difference in our credit histories. Hence, Wells Fargo 's decision to approve my husband 's application and to deny mine could not have been based on reasons related to credit worthiness. 
My husband and I have lived at the same addresses for many years, the last five years at the address submitted on the credit card applications and shown on all documentations provided to Wells Fargo for the identity verification process. During all these years, we have had the same joint telephone numbers. We both submitted all requested documents to Wells Fargo to comply with their identity verification process. In addition, I had and have active Wells Fargo debit and credit cards as part of joint accounts with my mother. These joint accounts show my identity ( name, social security number, DOB, address ) being identical to the information provided in the application. On XX/XX/XXXX, while in the branch office of XXXX XXXX submitting the documents for the identity verification process, I also requested a replacement debit card. It promptly arrived in my mail a few days later. Thus, Wells Fargo 's decision to approve my husband 's application and to deny mine could not have been based on reasons related to verification of identity. 
As stated above, XXXX XXXX XXXX, assured me on the phone that the denial of my application was final and not an error and followed up with another letter re-stating the denial. At the same time, Wells Fargo XXXX. assured my husband on the phone that the approval of his application was not an error and followed up with a letter confirming the opening of his credit card account. Therefore, Wells Fargo 's decision to approve my husband 's application and to deny mine could not have been made in error. 
Both of our applications were submitted to and processed by Wells Fargo XXXX. at the same time. Hence, Wells Fargo 's decision to approve my husband 's application and to deny mine could not have been based on reasons related to changes in approval/denial procedures, guidelines, or rules. 
Both of our applications and subsequent submittal of documents were sent to identical Wells Fargo XXXX. locations. Thus, Wells Fargo 's decision to approve my husband 's application and to deny mine could not have been based on reasons related to local differences in approval/denial procedures, guidelines, or rules. 
In conclusion, I have to assume that Wells Fargo 's decision to approve my husband 's application and to deny mine was made wholly or in substantial parts on the basis of the only significant differences in our applications or related information, i.e., on the basis of age, sex, race, national origin, religion, or color. An act that is in violation of 15 U.S.C. paragraph 1691 et seq."
4823,The following accounts listed on the FTC report were unauthorized and resulted in my social security number being used fraudulently.
4824,"In XXXX and XXXX I contacted Wells Fargo banks credit card services fraud and disputes department and filed a fraud claim with them ; my credit card limit was {$11000.00} and then someone stole my identity and compromised my Wells Fargo credit card. When I contacted Wells Fargos credit card fraud department to file a fraud claim, I was advised that the claim had been filed and that I would not be responsible for any fraudulent changes made to my credit card. Wells Fargos negligence in NOT opening a fraud claim or Putting a complete stop on the credit card has resulted in Wells Fargo filing a collection law suit against me and without me knowing. In late XXXX Wells Fargo bank went to court and requested from the XXXX XXXX county superior court in California that the court favors Wells Fargo bank and file a judgement against me for money that I did NOT owe Wells Fargo bank. My credit limit was {$11000.00} and because Wells Fargo did not file my fraud claim and identity theft claim properly ; the person or persons who had access to my Wells Fargo credit card had fraudulently charged over {$30000.00} in fraudulent charges. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from my employer that Wells Fargo bank had a wage garnishment and a levy on my wages. Since XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo has been deducting money from my biweekly wages and has had a wage garnishment order to withhold funds from my paychecks. This has caused me severe financial problems and has put me and my family in a situation to where we could barely eat or have a place to live. I have filed a claim of Exemption but it was denied by the court because Wells Fargos counsel of record had lied and continues to lie to the court that I was responsible for those fraudulent charges. I am planning on filing a motion to vacate the judgement and provide the court with ALL the physical evidence that I have showing and proving that I contacted Wells Fargo over two years ago regarding the fraudulent charges. How can Wells Fargo allow someone other then myself to make those fraudulent charges and allow the credit limit to keep going beyond the LIMIT of {$11000.00} that I had. Wells Fargo has also since sent me two settlement checks because of deceptive law practices and also allowing other individuals to apply for a checking account, savings account and a credit card account without my knowledge. I am requesting that this agency publish this for the world to see. If Wells Fargo does not cease all collection and wage garnishments from me, I will post this to every social media Platform to expose Wells Fargo and notify everyone of theirs unlawful business and collection practices."

I do n't have any judgments.
4848,"On XXXX XXXX XXXX I requested a balance transfer, via phone, from my Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX card. I gave the XXXX digit number of the credit card I wished to pay off. I gave the last XXXX digits of the Wells Fargo XXXX, the last XXXX digits of my SS, my full name, and my full mailing address. I was told at that time the transfer was on it 's way. I monitored both cards and a week later I noticed the card I was trying to pay off had not been paid off. I checked my Wells Fargo account and noticed XXXX transactions.

4849,"Wells Fargo routinely fails to award bonus cash back for purchases made through its "" Wells Fargo XXXX '' program. For example, I responded ( by "" activating '' offer on XXXX web site ) to an offer to receive 10 % back on a purchase at XXXX XXXX. ON XX/XX/XXXX I made a {$45.00} purchase at XXXX XXXX with my XXXX credit card number ending in XXXX. I should have received {$4.00} cash reward. I received nothing. I used the XXXX card rather than a XXXX  card I could have received 5 % cash back, because of this offer.

Thank you."
4852,"I filed a claim with my bank, Wells Fargo, back in XX/XX/2021. The dispute was a debit from my account in the amount of {$830.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX AL where I NEVER received any product due to unavailability of furniture due to COVID-19. XXXX XXXX does not divulge the complete information until payment has been submitted -- gives a standard reveal that furniture will be available in about 3-4 weeks. This is not true because XXXX XXXX is accepting orders knowing full well that the furniture is unobtainable. Now, XXXX XXXX is stating it is entitled to my {$830.00} because it has a non-cancellation policy. This is not the issue -- I NEVER received any product nor was contacted to state that the product is available for shipment -- NEVER. Wells Fargo did an investigation and credited the monies back into my account ; however, WF is reversing that decision and debiting my account because XXXX XXXX is stating that "" charges were made by you or someone who had your permission. '' XXXX XXXX is not entitled to the {$830.00} because this is a scam -- never received any product nor was contacted to state that the furniture was available as of this date. This is highway robbery."
4854,"I was getting married and opened a no interest for 12 months credit card issued by Wells Fargo to pay for the wedding ring ( "" Account X '' ). The terms of the card were that if the total sum of the loan were paid in 12 months, then there would be no interest. If the sum was not paid, then I would be responsible for XXXX % annual interest for the entire amount of the original loan. 

At some point, I stopped receiving statements about my account. Because I had setup 12 recurring payments I believed my account to be paid off. 

Moving forward I had to purchase a wedding band and my wedding ring, so I opened another 12 month interest free card issued by Wells Fargo ( "" Account Y '' ). I received a letter in the mail detailing how to setup automatic payments to this account, which I went through and did. The next month I received a call from a Wells Fargo representative insisting that I had not made any payments to Account Y. 

Through discussion with Wells Fargo, I discovered the automatic payments most recently setup had been directed to Account X. Account X had not been paid off. The recurring payments I had setup were not sufficient to pay off the total loan, and I had not received any communication in email, writing, or phone to tell me about the incoming interest charges or the numerous late fees and missed payments I had. When I went back and looked at the statements for the first time using their online website, I found a month in which I had a {$1700.00} balance and was charged a {$1200.00} interest fee. I am attaching this particular statement, which I saw for the first time less than a month ago ( ~5 months after the end of the promotional 12 month period ) Per Wells Fargo , at some point I was switched over to getting "" electronic statements '' although I can not ascertain why. Wells Fargo has provided confusing answers for which email address statements were sent to. One time they said one email, another time they said a different one. I have checked all of the emails referenced by them thoroughly and there is no record in my spam folders, inbox, or any other folder of statements or statement notifications from Wells Fargo. 

I spoke with an executive at Wells Fargo, and with the IT department at Wells Fargo, and they insist that emails were sent but will not offer me any proof that such emails were sent. I contacted my email providers and my email servers have never received email from Wells Fargo. I believe that they will not provide proof that emails were sent because they were not sent. They had a strong incentive to not provide the statements which I am entitled to by law. 

I raised these issues with the executive and they referred my issue to a case manager XXXX XXXX, available at XXXX ext XXXX. I was assured that I would be contacted after 10 business days. After more than 10 business days I had not received a call, and called XXXX XXXX at the number above. She was unavailable and called me back later. At that point, she gave me no new information and just said the same thing that the customer service agents had told me to begin with. They would not tell me why the statements were not delivered, or why I was not contacted before {$1700.00} in interest was charged on a {$1200.00} balance. This is predatory lending, and Wells Fargo is manipulating customers so that they will not pay their balance in 12 months. They have an incredible incentive with these contracts to neglect the borrower 's rights to monthly statements and to notifications of changes in interest rate, which I never received."
4855,"I disputed this alleged account and requested through the credit reporting agencies that the accuracy of this account be verified and that documents on file be mailed to me to show detailed billing and contractual obligation to pay the alleged debt. The following letters were sent to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX which did not deny liability, but requested 100 % accuracy in reporting and verification of the alleged debt and documents used to verify the debt to be sent to my address for review : Letter 1 sent on XX/XX/21 Letter 2 sent on XX/XX/21 Letter 3 sent on XX/XX/21 Letter 4 sent on XX/XX/21 As of the date of this complaint, I have not received documents to satisfy my request. Please note that I never denied the ownership of the account, I requested the account be reported 100 % accurate. I do not recall spending XXXX. I believe I have a right to review the charges on the account before agreeing to pay the amount you allege, I owe. 
Since I never received billing statements, I am requesting all statements to show how the alleged balance was calculated. Please send them to my address above. I want to see all charges on the account to arrive at the sum of XXXX. 
Send me all statements from when the account was opened along with any applications and contracts completed to open the account bearing my signature and opening dates, where the account was opened ( if opened at a branch, provide the location ), and any other information that was supplied to open and use this account. Since you are reporting the account as charged-off, send me a notarized statement that the debt was not utilized as a profit-loss tax deduction during the period it may have been payable, and was not claimed as a loss with any insuring entity during the period it may have been payable."
4857,"I am living in XXXX but worked 2 months at the University of XXXX in 2011 and opened a bank account at Wells Fargo that time. I have about {$800.00} in my account and requested a credit card to get access to my money. The bank refuses to send me the card to my home address ( although this is the address they have in file ) and the only option they offer to get access to my money is that I should personally visit a branch. Of course the time and cost for travelling from XXXX to USA is  more than {$800.00}, so it is impossible in practice. They state that they can not verify my identity otherwise and rejected my suggestion that I will scan my ID or proof my identity otherwise. Thus, Wells Fargo do n't offer me any way to get access to my own money."
4858,My unemployment card I have requested three times they told me the first two times it be in around two or three business day the first two cards arrived together through XXXX.

Well since the first two cards I cancel them now today date is XXXX XXXX. My third card still has not arrived. I was on the phone with customer service and the young lady was being rude.

I feel someone or everyone is commiting fraud or trying for me to give up the funds to the debit card holder bank. I have bills to pay and am tired of them making too many excuses I have asks if they be able to transfer my money to my saving account they told me no. I feel they are able to do it but the refuses to do so. And the bank saving account is under my name and belongs to me the saving account. Am overwhelmed tired fedup stress out and just want to give up on life over this issues with this card debit card bank please help asap
4859,"I have a loan with Wells Fargo Bank. I have always made my payments on time. For some reason I realized that there was a late payment on my credit report. As you can see, I have always had a stellar payment record with this company. I tried contacting both XXXX  and Wells Fargo Bank with no successful resolution. XXXX  is only reporting me late. There was definitely an error on their part. I was never 30 days late last XX/XX/2015."
4861,"I was issued XXXX XXXX Debit card ending in XXXX which happened to be a fake one, not associated to me records. I turned this fake fraudulent card to a bank in XXXX at XXXX XXXX The real debit card end in XXXX has been used for over 150 transaction without my authorization or consent. My case was denied because they say I authorized this transaction which impossible because I never had that card ending in XXXX. 

They have been un willing to connect to explain or reasoning for this arbitrary decision. This effects my credit and my identity. 

Wells Fargo also seem very un concerned that the fake debit card I returned was an issue. 

I would like my case to approved in a more timely manner and Wells Fargo held accountable."
4862,"XXXX XXXX made an erroneous filing of a "" severely past due account '', which was submitted in error, based on a fraudulent theft of "" courtesy checks '' from my mailbox that in a case they had investigated and closed ( see cfpb complaint XXXX. 

Without contact or notice Wells Fargo summarily blocked and closed this account, causing embarrassment and hardship on the card holder."
4864,Again Wells Fargo has failed to answer the one question I had for them. Why did you want me to send a copy of my signature to you to verify that the signature on the XXXX XXXX XXXX slip was mine?
4865,"On XX/XX/2020 around XXXX, I received a text alert from XXXX that a transaction on a card that was in my possession ( never stolen or missing and rarely even used ) for {$3100.00} was PENDING from Wells Fargo in XXXX XXXX FL XXXX I immediately called my bank to block the card ending in XXXX and told them that I did not authorize this. I am a XXXX veteran and this took 99 % of my XXXX check. I asked them to stop this pending transaction and was told by the CS that I had to wait until it posted to do a dispute. The next day, the transaction ( {$3100.00} and {$3.00} over the counter fee from Wells Fargo ) posted to my account with the following memos : Signature purchase from XXXX WELLS FARGO C/A # XXXX XXXX FL XXXX XXXX Card ending in XXXX Debit : OTC Withdrawal Fee Posted on XX/XX/2020 at XXXX I immediately filed the dispute with my bank and called Wells Fargo Fraud number on XX/XX/XXXX. The CS at Wells Fargo told me that because I was not their banks customer to contact me own bank for this dispute. And that was that with Wells Fargo. They took my money and now Im suffering undue hardship. The claim ( # XXXX XXXX for this fraudulent transaction at a Wells Fargo in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX has left me devastated.

I am unable to pay any of my expenses to include Rent, car payment, car insurance, etc. I have incurred late fees, non sufficient fund fees from my bill collectors as a result of this fraudulent transaction. I believe this is an inside job with an employee of XXXX and an employee of Wells Fargo.I also believe I aint the only one that got ROBBED from this type of fraud by these two businesses."
4867,"I contacted Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2019 to inquire about the product that I received from them. I was approved for a charge card ( {$2700.00} in credit ) that was useable for two merchants : XXXX XXXX and XXXX by XXXX. When I spoke to a CSR, I was informed that I couldnt use the card for the other merchant, but strictly XXXX XXXX. I was also informed that I couldnt change the product neither transfer/reallocate my credit line because it was a charge card, so I requested them to close the account. Though my account was in good standing and never used, closing my account with Wells Fargo impacted my credit score. I was highly disappointed and dissatisfied with their service. Why would the lender issue me a product that had both retail brands printed on the card itself? Thats false advertisement! Both companies are affiliated and issued by the same bank. I filed a dispute ( same date ) with the credit bureau to inform them in advance that Wells Fargo closed the account by my request. Less than 30 days, I saw remarks on my account that stated consumer disagrees when all I did was close the account due to false advertisement."
4872,"On XX/XX/XXXX, a fraudster gained unauthorized access to my online Wells Fargo account. The fraudster was able to initiate a cash advance from the credit card in the amount of {$7200.00} to the checking and from the checking, wired the {$7200.00}, along with {$1900.00} from the checking account ( {$9100.00} in total ) to an unknown account/bank. Prior to this incident, I had a {$0.00} balance on the credit card with an available credit balance of {$7500.00}. I also had {$2000.00} in the checking account. No unusual transactions alerts were triggered. Wells Fargo did not flag either the cash advance or the wire transfer. I have had these accounts for XXXX years and have never authorized a wire transfer out of my accounts. 

I reported the fraudulent transactions to Wells Fargo via telephone and a representative went through measures to issue out a new checking account number, a new debit card and a new credit card. The representative assured me that the matter would be investigated and to rest assured, Wells Fargo would help keep my accounts secure and assist me in restoring the funds taken by the fraudster. However, despite me making multiple calls to check in on the status of the claim, I was given the runaround repeatedly. Several representatives sympathized with me, while others questioned the authenticity of my claim. 

Wells Fargo failed violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by failing to properly investigate my dispute of fraudulent transactions on my Wells Fargo Checking/Credit Accounts XXXX Despite reporting the fraudulent transactions to Wells Fargo on the day that the transactions occurred, Wells Fargo kept the fees associated with the fraud on the account, which resulted in the credit balance to be overlimit. Additionally, Wells Fargo reported the credit card account as OVERLIMIT to Credit Reporting Agencies ( reported on XX/XX/XXXX ), which resulted in my credit score decreasing by XXXX points. 

I did not know about or authorize anyone to initiate these transactions on my Wells Fargo Accounts. I did not know about anyone who owns a XXXX bank account to which the my funds were transferred to. 
I have attempted to dispute the fraudulent transactions directly with Wells Fargo several times but Wells Fargo has closed these claims with the conclusion that I have authorized these transactions, despite me consistently telling them that I did not authorize or give my authorization to anyone to initiate these transactions. I have also reported these fraudulent transactions to CFPBXXXX XXXX  OCC, AG, FDIC, and the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Report # is XXXX and the report was taken by XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo has responded to CFPB claims with little to no change. They applied a credit to refund the fees associated with fraudulent balance, however a balance of {$6700.00} remains. A payment on this fraudulent balance is due and Wells Fargo has told me that I will need to pay this balance. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo to address the lack of action that has been done in regards to my disputes. After being on the line for more than XXXX hours and being transferred XXXX times, the XXXX representative whose name is XXXX from the Customer Advocacy Group reviewed my concerns. He guaranteed that no payment would be due, no late or interest charge fees would be applied and that it would not be reported to the CRAs while the claim was open. He provided me with a reference number for the recorded call - # XXXX XXXX XXXX. A payment was still due, a late payment of {$29.00} was applied as well as an interest charge of {$110.00}. 

I have also disputed the transaction to XXXX twice. The first time, Wells Fargo, responded with a result of "" Completed investigation of FCRA dispute - consumer disagrees ''. I filed another dispute with XXXX and it is currently open. 

I complied with the expectations set forth in Wells Fargo Online Use Agreement, in regards to the liability of unauthorized EFTs. 
XXXXI reported fraudulent activity directly to Wells Fargo via telephone on XX/XX/XXXX. Claim was opened and representative confirmed that no further action was needed on my part. 
-Received statement reflecting erroneous/fraudulent charges on XX/XX/XXXX -Sent written notice to Wells Fargo via Certified Mail on XX/XX/XXXX ( within 60 days of receiving the statement showing first unauthorized electronic fund transfer ). 
Per Wells Fargo 's own Online Use Agreement, with respect to Regulation E, my liability "" won't exceed lesser of {$50.00}, or the total amount of unauthorized EFTs that occur before notice to us ''. 

I called Wells Fargo XX/XX/XXXX and was able to speak with analyst, XXXX XXXX, who closed out case # XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX reviewed that the cases were closed - HOWEVER, she reported that when working with the fraud investigators and other departments in regards to the claim, they deemed the claims for the credit card transactions as FRAUD. XXXX went on to explain that while Wells Fargo acknowledges that the transaction was fraud, they are unable to reverse it because the funds are no longer in the checking account. I explained to her that the funds were not in the checking because the fraudster had wired the funds to an unknown account. XXXX acknowledged that she did see in the notes of my case that the funds were wired to an account at XXXX bank but when Wells Fargo attempted to recall the funds, XXXX would not return the funds- either because the funds were no longer there and/or because the account was now closed. XXXX stated that Wells Fargo did not go further than attempt to recall the funds. I asked if they attempted to track the funds and she said that they did not. Another representative, XXXX, said that if Wells Fargo attempts to recall the funds and the other bank does not cooperate, Wells Fargo does not go further and will not attempt to recall again. 

Wells Fargo has confirmed that their findings surrounding the credit balance are that the transaction was indeed fraudulent. Multiple representatives have identified this fraud to be a trend amongst numerous Wells Fargo customers. Yet Wells Fargo is doing nothing to offer relief or support from the economic hardships resulting from having my accounts completely wiped out by these fraudulent transactions. Wells Fargo failed to conduct an investigation with respect to the disputed information and failed to review all relevant information provided by me in the dispute provided to them and other agencies I reported to."
4874,"I paid off my XXXX Card, Wells Fargo card service, and 1 of my XXXX XXXX XXXX personal loan account XXXX. My XXXX XXXX and 2nd XXXX XXXX XXXX  loan amount are incorrect. They Both were paid down, My XXXX XXXX car loan is {$25000.00} now and my 2nd XXXX XXXX  XXXX loan amount is {$7300.00}. which is account number XXXX. Please have all three Credit Bureaus update asap. Thanks"
4877,"I contacted XXXX XXXX and was told to call Well fargo to gain online access..they both said I have to wait for the bill ... NONE ARRIVED .... 
I called Wells Fargo again and they told me they sent it and I had a past due amount ... I asked if they had the correct mailing address.. 
( THEY DID NOT ) .... 
they fixed it ..took a payment over the phone and I was told there would be no late fee as it was there fault for the wrong address ... ( she even showed it was returned : ( ( ) The bill shows up today ( X/XX/17 ) that says I owe XXXX on XXXX XXXX 
i attempted to set up on line access with the Number on the invoice ... 
No problem : ) When I call Wells fargo they say they can not setup my online payment account until I pay the LATE fee from XXXX : ( XXXX bucks .... seems WRONG!!!"
4880,"I had a XXXX ' XXXX gift card that was linked to my Wells Fargo credit card. When the gift card balance dropped below {$5.00} or {$10.00}, the account was set up to automatically transfer {$15.00} over from my credit card. Toward the end of XX/XX/2021, I noticed that there were an unusually high number of {$15.00} XXXX ' charges on my credit card back to back to back. I immediately contacted XXXX ' to close the gift card and see what could be done on their end. They provided me with the online transaction history for the gift card which showed purchases made over and over within the same day across a number of states I've never even been to. They also provided me with a detailed spreadsheet of financial details for all the activity on my XXXX ' account. 

I immediately took this information to Wells Fargo to report the fraud. The banker I was working with assured me that this was very standard fraud and would be handled quickly and easily. Within a few days, my Wells Fargo account was showing a bunch of {$15.00} reimbursements, which I thought meant the fraud claim had been resolved. Then, a couple of weeks later, I was hit with a charge for a little over {$1800.00}. I called to find out what that was about, and was told my claim had been denied. They were unable to give me a clear reason for why. I asked to appeal their decision and was told how to begin the "" reconsideration '' process. 

I returned to the bank the next day with all of the paperwork from XXXX ' again, and they helped me fax all of that information to the fraud department. I was told it would be around 15 days for the decision. Meanwhile, I received a letter in the mail saying Wells Fargo had been unable to reach me for 10+ days. They called me several times and I immediately called back every time to provide them the information they needed. Never once did they ask me anything specific about the fraud. Their only questions were things like wanting to confirm my billing address. 

I called the fraud team again to make sure they had all the information they needed, since apparently they hadn't been able to contact me ( which wasn't true at all ). I was told they had what they needed and I would hear the decision within a week or two. We got the letter in the mail a few days ago saying the appeal was denied because the charges were consistent with my typical card usage. I understand that a {$15.00} charge for coffee here and there might seem typical when looked at individually, but there were dozens of these charges being made daily. Additionally, I had proof from XXXX ' themselves that my account had been hacked ( they were able to trace it back to some specific incident in Georgia, even though I hadn't been there ) and the transaction history showing that "" I '' was traveling to different cities and states every few hours. 

Needless to say, I am done with Wells Fargo. Throughout this process, I have learned more and more about their flawed business practices and extreme lack of clear communication and customer support. I will be closing my accounts and moving to another bank as soon as I'm able. I am fortunate to be able to cover the {$1800.00} of fraud charges, but only just barely. On a XXXX XXXX salary and needing to spend my own money to purchase lab supplies for my XXXX  XXXX, I do not have the means or time to continue fighting for myself with Wells Fargo. I don't know if anything else can be done to remedy the situation, but I at least want to make sure that others are aware of the lack of adequate fraud protection associated with Wells Fargo 's credit cards."
4881,They closed my credit card account DURING A PANDEMIC. I had wrote them telling them I was experiencing financial hardship ( my unemployment didnt come in for MONTHS from their backlog in new accounts everywhere ) and they basically said too bad and they couldnt do anything then they give me pandemic assistance and allow me to skip payments for 6 months but keep my account closed. I missed only two XXXX  payments. This was XX/XX/2020 I tried to initially talk to them and STILL they wont reopen it. Its so embarrassing to have that on my credit report for TWO missed payment. Come one.
4882,"I called Wells Fargo Dispute Department to pay {$63.00} but before I made a payment, I told them I wasnt going to pay until they removed the entire account off my credit report on XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX  which they agree and they would send a copy to my address that I paid and it was going to removed off my credit report. The phone called was recorded. After a month, I got a letter saying the loan was resolved but nothing that it was going to be removed off my credit report like they initiated on a recorded phone conversation. when I check my credit report the account was still on there which they lie."
4884,"Emails regarding my account, that is brand new, were sent to my ex-husband who is not on the account and his contact was not included when I opened the card. Breach of privacy."
4885,I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and I am submitting this complaint myself and there is no third party involve.This account WELLS FARGO BANK is inaccurately and erroneously reporting. Their intentional and willful furnishing of inaccurate information is a violation of FCRA Section 623 and according to FCRA Section 611. I have done many attempts to reach out to 3 Credit Bureaus but they failed to give me any results or feedbacks about this concern. Please investigate and remove it from my personal credit file. Thank you.
4886,"Wells Fargo opened a business credit card with the intent for me to use it as over draft protection. Wells Fargo didnt not tell me that they would be sending me a CC to my home or that I had a available balance of XXXX. I was under the ussumption that it was for over draft protection. I got the card, I used the card and payed on the card for over 1 year until I found out the interest rate on the card was over 25 %. I submitted for a lower rate and was declined. I couldnt afford to pay the monthly payment on the card and now the withdrew money from my personal acct even though I am going through mediation. Wells Fargo is a scam bank that doesnt treat there customers with respect and regard. I also did not sign for the card issued."
4888,Wells Fargo VISA has denied me any and all information about activity on my account. The activity I 'm referring to is payments I 've made to WF Visa over the past 2 months that should have resulted in paying my balance in full or perhaps having an amount due to me. The denial has come in the form of not allowing me access through WF online banking nor sending me statements in the mail even after a written request from me in late XXXX. I believe that Wells Fargo 's withholding of the aforementioned information is illegal or unconscionable at best.
4889,"Credit card number:XXXX Dear Wells Fargo Complaints Department XXXX On Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX, I called customer support line at XXXX and requested credit balance refunds from both of my credit cards : XXXX and XXXX XXXX. The refunds were processed and mailed on a Friday XX/XX/XXXX. On Monday XX/XX/XXXX I received a notification from usps through informed delivery that both checks would be delivered the same day. When I checked my mail I only found one check for {$220.00}, and {$610.00} check was missing. I waited two days and spoke to a XXXX who told me that they did not have any checks for me. Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) at XXXX I called the same number and reported my check lost or stolen. The gentlemen on the phone told me he was going to put a stop payment on a check and either mail a new one or put a credit back on the account. I let him know that unless checks would be mailed with some sort of tracking I would prefer just a credit back on the account. He then told me that I could come to a Wellls Fargo Branch and request a cashiers check from the credit card balance. I arrived at XXXX XXXX and was connected with a banker XXXX XXXX. She let me know that they could not do a cashiers check and called credit cards services from a bank line. At that time the whole situation took a different turn : the agent and her supervisor ( XXXX ) were completely unhelpful. The lady accused me of lying of contacting the bank prior and XXXX refused to put a stop payment on a check or confirm that it was done, he refused to reverse any fees if I were to take a cash advance from MY OWN MONEY from the credit balance. I spent 2 hours just to get to nowhere. I do have screenshots of both mail envelopes with checks in them that I received on a Monday as a proof. I need my money back and I need it now, as a solution I am requesting either and ACH transfer to my own bank account or allowing me to a cash withdrawal of my own money without any fees. And I want to make sure that stop payment has been placed on a lost/stolen check. 
I also would like you to review my calls that were made to a call center today and all the notes. 

Thank you for your time, XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX"
4890,"Wells Fargo has used the past national scandal involving widespread abuse of the application process by its representatives to practice widespread discrimination -- according to the perceived ethnicity and/or racial background of applicants over the phone -- in the form of a policy of doing hard inquiries on consumer credit files in connection with any and all applications for Wells Fargo consumer financial products, without having any intention to compete the application, until and unless the applicant phones in. Long before I adopted my recent practice of freezing my credit files, Wells Fargo has always been the only financial institution I have ever encountered that consistently requires me to phone in to verify my identity in connection with an application of any kind, which I have been informed today by a Wells Fargo representative is standard procedure with Wells Fargo. Although Wells Fargo will doubtless claim that this is a means for Wells Fargo to address past widespread abuse of the application process by Wells Fargo representatives, it also serves ( intentionally or not ) to provide Wells Fargo with an opportunity to practice widespread discrimination based on the perceived ethnicity and/or racial background of applicants over the phone ( I myself am of XXXX-Descent ). 

By way of example, my application for a VISA Cash Wise Credit Card ( Reference # : XXXX ) was declined over the phone today ( I had received an email from Wells Fargo last night indicating that I needed to phone in for my application to be processed, 22 minutes before I got an email notification from XXXX that my credit file had been accessed by Wells Fargo ), supposedly because I have too many unused credit cards. Although it is conceivable that this could be a legitimate reason for declining a credit card application, it is one that I have not previously encountered or heard of in 20 years as an avid e-consumer. More to the point, it is blatantly fraudulent for Wells Fargo to have a policy of doing hard inquiries on consumer credit files in connection with applications for a consumer financial products without having any intention to actually process the application until and unless the applicant phones in. 

Of particular concern is an application I submitted online on XX/XX/2017 for Wells Fargo Ways2Save and Everyday Checking accounts ( Reference # : XXXX, in response to a Wells Fargo flyer sent to me by U.S. Mail ). The application was immediately conditionally approved via email pending my return of a signed & dated standard Consumer Account Application form, only to have Wells Fargo send me a second email 10 days later requiring me to phone in for my application to be processed, which I did not do, since I suspected it was a ruse on the part of Wells Fargo to use the national scandal involving pervasive fraudulence on the part of its representatives as a pretext for practicing widespread discrimination -- and which I phoned in today specifically to confirm ( I only unfroze my credit files yesterday through the end of next month because I am in the process of moving and have no plans to apply for any more consumer loans or financial products of any kind )."
4894,I was shocked when reviewing my credit report and found late payments with no dates. Two 30 days late and one 60 day late. I am not sure how this happened. I believe I made my payments when I received my statement. My only thought is that my statement did not get to me. This account has been paid and closed since XX/XX/18.
4895,"I bought 4 concert tickets from XXXX XXXX through the internet online and put the charge of the tickets on my Wells Fargo credit card on XX/XX/XXXX. The purchase was for a concert scheduled to take place in XXXX Alabama on XX/XX/XXXX. I found out the tickets had someone elses name on them. I was not happy with this fact and so I filed a disputed with Wells Fargo within an hour of the original purchase. The price for the tickets was {$230.00}. Again, I filed a dispute within the hour with Wells Fargo told them I did not want the tickets do not pay the merchant let them sue me I would take responsibility. They initiated an investigation. The concert was mind you around 3 weeks away so I let them know that time was of the essence. If they weren't going to allow me to reverse the charge then I needed to know before the concert. With the concert nearing approach and the investigation not yet completed I ended up purchasing 4 other tickets through XXXX XXXX for my wife and two friends. I did this a few days before the concert when me and my wife through a number of phone calls found out that Wells Fargo failed to initiate contact in a timely manner with the merchant. It was an undeniable fact that the investigation would not be complete until after the event. This was due to the untimely nature that Wells Fargo initiated the investigation. I found out that Wells Fargo failed to initiate contact with the merchant until a week or two after the concert. On XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX I found out that Wells Fargo put the charges back on my credit card. The merchant is not authorized to do business in Alabama. I fact checked this information with the Secretary of State and let Wells Fargo know that during the investigation and before the concert took place. I was willing to deal with the merchant directly and let them know that I was not willing to complete the purchase. For informational purposes I can tell you that I actually disputed it directly with that merchant on the same date I initiated the complaint with Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. The merchant immediately ceased contact with me and informed me that it was a matter between me and my financial institution. I would like Wells Fargo to refund the {$230.00} back to me and fail or refuse to pay this merchant. This merchant is not authorized to do business in Alabama, and I will gladly take responsibility directly with the merchant and let them try and collect the money from me. I have had an account with Wells Fargo or the previous financial institution they inherited since XX/XX/XXXX. I do feel that Wells Fargo has not listened to what I want to see happen in this particular situation, and I am not very happy with Wells Fargo. I as a consumer should be able to dispute the transaction. Wells Fargo 's actions in regard to my initial dispute were not initiated in a timely manner. Because of this I have suffered damages in the amount of {$230.00}. By placing the charges now months after the concert took place it is impossible for me to utilize the product that I purchased. The purchase can be rightfully rescinded since the purchase occurred in Alabama for an event that was to take place in Alabama, and the merchant in question was not authorized to do business in Alabama. Therefore I had an unequivocal right to rescind the purchase. Wells Fargo failed and continues to fail to recognize me legal rights in regard to this particular situation and are wrongfully charging me for the amount of {$230.00}."
4898,"I have two accounts with Wells Fargo Bank, a savings account and a credit card account. On XX/XX/2021, I was notified by Wells Fargo via email that my account had been locked due to suspicious activity on my credit and savings accounts. Later in the evening on XX/XX/2021, I discovered that a cyber fraudster had taken a {$3500.00} cash advance accompanied with an additional {$200.00} in fees from my credit card, placed it in my savings account, and transferred {$2000.00} out to a unknown third party. I attempted to report these fraudulent purchases to Wells Fargo, but, because I was unable to fully verify my identity over the phone that evening, I was told to go into a branch to verify my identity. 

The next day, on XX/XX/2021, I went to a Wells Fargo branch to verify my identity and report the fraudulent activity. After spending about an hour and a half at the bank, I believed that a claim had been made and that the bank would provisionally credit the account in 2-10 business days. Regrettably, this was the beginning of Wells Fargo 's stonewalling tactics when it comes to handling cyber fraud claims. 

Two weeks later on XX/XX/2021, the bank reached a determination that I either personally made the transactions in question or that I authorized the transactions in question, denying my claim. This determination is not grounded in truth and is a sad reflection of Wells Fargo 's lack of interest in investigating these claims in good faith. According to my understanding of the banks investigation, the bank concluded that someone had been accessing the account consistently for a period of time and this individual 's behavior was consistent with my activity as a Wells Fargo customer. Therefore, Wells Fargo concluded that I was to person who engaged in these cash advances and online transfer. At no point was I interviewed concerning my online banking activity at other banks, my location within the United States, the devices I've used in the past, the IP addresses I use, or my overall financial position. Furthermore, it is highly illogical that Wells Fargo would freeze my account on XX/XX/2021 because it suspected suspicious activity then on the other hand deny my claim because it was 100 % my doing. 

After getting the denial letter, I escalated the claim to Wells Fargo 's "" Line of Business Executive Office. '' A few days later, based on the same incomplete analysis as the bank used to make its initial determination. Wells Fargo decided to stick by its original, flawed, and embarrassingly incomplete investigation. 

Statutorily, Wells Fargo and other credit card issuers are required to limit the liability of customers who are victims of fraud on credit accounts. Wells Fargo 's only way to get around this obligation is to accuse their own long term customers ( I've been a customer for 20 years, my family has been customers for 50 years, and my grandfather worked at the bank ) of lying to them. 

Sadly, based on an incomplete image of my sign-on activity in my online banking portal the bank has deemed me to indeed be, not a victim of fraud, but a friendly fraudster. I find Wells Fargo 's determination personally offensive but unsurprising."
4899,Over a period of several months I have tried to resolve a dispute with Wells Fargo credit card department about a dispute I made last year 2020 for {$110.00} on XX/XX/2020. I have been given the run around and told to send a written letter for a second time to reopen dispute and got same answer declined without an explanation. I want my dispute resolved and for Wells Fargo to solve my dispute without wasting my time and not really investigating the issue and violating my rights as a consumer.
4900,just start to notice this started cant really say when it started when my mother and brother pass when we recieve they life insurance money my gmail account information was tamper with which the email account was XXXX I am and over the round truck driver I also notice round the same time my card information and bank card was used which made me check my account and i notice someone had access my phone information cant just give dates because someone has been getting money and using my cards since 2017 the reason i never notice is they was taking it peace by peace and access to my phone information i cant access my phone information had to change number because someone tryed to access my accounts
4901,"1. I spoke with Wells Fargo about having a hard time in general about having a hard time making payments and an over drafted checking account in XXXX 2021. I told them that I would resolve it soon having lost both of my jobs due to XXXX and not expecting a paycheck until I was able to start a new job and get paid a cycle after. Wells Fargo communicated that they understood and said they would give me until XXXX to resolve and asked if this applied to my other accounts and I said yes for my credit card account and they said that they had notated in the notes. 
2. Despite # 1, I still received communications about my outstanding balance for my credit card and chatted with an agent on the phone around XXXX XXXX, 2021. When chatting with this agent, he stated that he was calling specifically about the credit card -- so I referenced the previous phone call -- and he informed that my account was in danger of being closed despite me communicating the COVID-19 hardships and being told that I would receive that grace. During that call, we worked out a payment arrangement of around {$200.00}, however, I offered to pay more than the minimum that day to protect my account from being closed. I was going to use the money I had on hand from a prepaid card, however, the agent informed me that Wells Fargo would rather prefer a larger payment later that month. So instead of taking my payment, the agent insisted that XXXX setup an arrangement for later and set it up for me. In addition, I re-discussed how the credit reporting would still show current and not past due because of the COVID-19 pandemic and he said that it would. To sum, the agent called me, refused my payment that day of, reiterated my COVID-19 grace, setup a payment arrangement, and then verbally confirmed that my account would not be closed after answering a direct question on a recorded line. 
3. 2-3 days later, Wells Fargo closed my account. I contacted them immediately and referenced the call and asked them to re-open it again and to fix the error. I communicated the significant harm that it had did to my credit health and what that meant during the public health pandemic and Wells Fargo made me a claim # and told that they would investigate it and provide me with more info. Wells Fargo never followed up. 
4. Fast forward to XX/XX/2021, after getting discouraged and working with a credit counselor, I noticed that Wells Fargo had been reporting some significant negative credit history despite the balance being resolved. I reached out to Wells Fargo to ask about the investigation and to ask they keep their word at least for the credit reporting as the balance was settled. They informed me that they sent a report citing a provision in the contract stating that they can close any account whenever they want and that was the case here. I asked about the verbal agreement and commitment they made to me just days prior to closing my account and they communicated that they reviewed the call and would not go into detail further on how they stated that they would not close my account. Also, helpful to note that I offered to pay that day and if done there is a likelihood my account would have not been closed but Wells Fargo insisted that I pay another day later that month and closed my account shortly after. Wells Fargo created an executive case and also informed me that the results of the XXXX 2021 investigation were sent by mail to an address that was not my mailing address that they found at the post office. When I asked why they would randomly send private financial information to an address that was never listed on my account over the other two accounts, they had no response. 
5. Later that month, still in XXXX 2021, the case manager : XXXX XXXX, sent me an email stating that she would be reviewing the call where Wells Fargo committed to everything in # 2 and she would reach out for more info before deciding the case. They set the deadline of finishing by XX/XX/2021 and I received no contact from XXXX before the decision was issued. I called multiple times before the case was finalized and chatted with others who attempted to reach out to her, and she refused to take all of my calls until I got a supervisor on the phone. She called 2-3 days before the deadline and communicated that she hadn't even looked into my case. Others in the office supported my advocacy and said that it was important to protect my credit health and that Wells Fargo had the capacity to live up to its commitments. That was not the case when the issue was decided. 
6. XXXX sent a letter on XX/XX/2021 to my correct mailing address that stated the same reasons cited in # 4. That they could do whatever they want despite having made any assurances to consumers. I called about this decision and was basically told that again and got no explanation on why this communication was sent to the correct mailing address and why the previous response had not, and they updated the credit reporting to stop reporting negative but still notated it as more than 60 days despite previous commitments. I asked was this ethical behavior for a consumer and let them know and they communicated to me verbally that they had no responsibility to consider any of those concerns because the contract I agreed to allowed them to do whatever they want without any notice."
4903,"I have been doing a lot of back and forth communication with this company Card Benefit Services which are the representatives of Wells Fargo insurance claims. XXXX Wednesday, XXXX XXXX. I spoke with a representative named XXXX that seemed to understand what is going on, the call was recorded on their side and the number I used to contact was XXXX. 

I was denied compensation due to the following "" The Cellular Telephone Protection Program does not cover items which have cosmetic damage or damage that does not impact the item 's ability to make or receive phone calls. '' The phone that I sent into them, does not function at all due to internal issues. It will not turn on and is non-operation. I called in to get clarification as to why they do n't cover my claim. They said it was due to the fact that they do n't cover internal/mechanical damage. 

If you take a look at the documentation I have uploaded, this is what I sent them as a rebuttal for their denial of insurance this might show a better understanding of what the situation in. 

I have called Wells Fargo for assistance on this issue, and they refused to help they stated they could n't do anything since the card was under XXXX XXXX Basically, I was denied a claim for an invalid reason. Wells Fargo insurance stipulates one thing, while Card Benefits Services claims that they follow different insurance. I have provided documentation under which I have cellular insurance provided from Wells Fargo. 

If this is n't the right agency to deal with this, could you forward this to the right agency? I just want this claimed resolved, and want it on the record that Card Benefit Services falsely denied me on a claim, and is n't following their policy. 

Case ID : XXXX XXXX"
4904,During the month of XXXX an unauthorized XXXX  was made in the amount of XXXX. Upon noticing the XXXX I immediately called my bank and told them about the fraudulent transaction.Wells Fargo gave me a temporary credit and days following denied my claim and reversed the credit ending in my account being negative XXXX.
4905,"This is a Wells Fargo account. I opened and used this account for home improvements. There are two charges : one in XX/XX/XXXX and the other in XX/XX/XXXX. The first charge is interest free with 24 equal payments. The required payment is $ XXXX. I made $ 100 monthly payments up until I made the second charge in XXXX. The required payment went up to {$200.00} ( XXXX + XXXX ). Once the second charge appeared on my bill, I made payments of $ XXXX. My intention was to pay off the first charge before the end of the 24 month period. However, Wells Fargo continues to deduct only the {$95.00} as payment from the {$500.00} I submit. This means that I will NOT payoff the first charge before the 24 month period. I have called and asked that the surplus payments be applied to the first charge and XXXX has flatly refused and they continue to apply the surplus to the second charge. The surplus payment is MY MONEY and since I am already meeting the required monthly payment, as such I should be allowed to designate that surplus of funds ( XXXX ) to whatever charge I want paid. What is so difficult about this? They should be happy I'm making my payments, including extra! Do they think someone paying their charges off early means they won't continue to make payments on the remaining charge balance?! 
My complaint is that since I am making the required minimum payment on both charges, any amount over that ( money I choose to use toward payments ) should go to the charge balance I prefer. Most other credit card companies allow this ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX ). Wells Fargo has a history of corrupt activity and this "" policy '' seems very suspicious. I am literally held hostage tp paying on the first charge for 24 months when I want to pay it off!!! They won't even let me do that!

4914,"Regulation Z violation Disputes ending in XXXX and XXXX were opened earlier this year, both for the same reason under goods or services not received. Within XXXX hours, Wells Fargo closed the disputes and no investigations were conducted, as required by Federal law. I reached out to Wells Fargo several times before today, including the CEO. First, I was told that information was needed by XXXX ( supervisor in Claims Assistance ) to reopen the cases. I cooperated and provided the information requested. Wells Fargo acknowledged receipt of the information, yet the disputes were still not investigated and remained closed. For both disputes, I was then told : "" Unable to Assist ''. 

Then, in XX/XX/2021, several months later, Wells Fargo decided to investigate the dispute ending in XXXX and provided a permanent credit for the disputed amount, but no investigation was conducted for the dispute ending in XXXX and no credit was provided. Again, both disputes were opened for the same reason, and nothing had changed between the dispute ending in XXXX and the dispute ending in XXXX. Wells Fargo *was* able to assist. Yet Wells Fargo chose to investigate the one ending in XXXX but chose not to investigate the one ending in XXXX. Plus, Wells Fargo is still assessing finance charges on the amount associated with the dispute ending in XXXX. 

Your assistance would be appreciated."
4915,"I tried several times to contact the company to get assistance with paying my credit card bill and lowering and/or removing fees during my time of a financial hardship due to loss of income, but have not been able to speak to anyone at the company for any help.

4917,"Issue : Overpaid my Wells Fargo ( 'WFC '' ) credit card payment on XX/XX/XXXX with assets from a Wells Fargo Account . Called customer service on XX/XX/XXXX and asked for the monies to be returned. I was told it could take up to 30-days and a check may be mailed. I see no reason that the funds, which where collected and paid from WFC account can not be credited immediately back to the account where the monies came from, a WFC checking account. I spoke with Customer Service Manager named XXXX. This is bad behavior, dishonest, not ethical, and abusive of power, not logical and in my opinion criminal. 

Consumer 's honest oversight ... .I had a XXXX payment due ... ..which I paid on-line on XX/XX/XXXX. In an effort to ensure my payment history is perfect, as I did not recall making the payment and knowing I owed about {$70.00}, I went on my phone and made what I thought was a {$70.00} payment but was actually a scribers error and was a {$700.00} payment. This resulted in a {$700.00} credit balance. 
It is unreasonable to take 30-days to return the monies, it is bad behavior to not act immediately, it is fraud not to return the monies immediately. XXXX, the supervisor, indicated that the monies would be held up to 30-days "" because we can ''. This is an egregious attitude from a Bank that apparently has not learned its lessons on how to behave like a Bank. It 's no wonder they have set XXXX XXXX  aside for legal fees and promised in their XXXX that the number will be increasing to defending their unethical business behavior. So my financial reputation and ability to make my payments on other accounts is in jeopardy because the BIG BANK needs 30-days to research payment activity from accounts maintained at WFC and credit back the {$700.00} overpayment. Scandalous! 

WFC 's "" marketing campaign '' to attempt to improve your image does not help when your employees are unable or unwilling to do the right thing. I was offered to spend additional time talking to a second supervisor ... .really ... how about WFC empower their employees to use common sense ... .unfortunately you ca n't regulate good behavior when you have dishonesty and bad behavior that get rewarded from WFC 's core management ... which is where it is learned ... .Keep investigating there is plenty of issues at WFC including thievery , thru an unauthorized loan of my assets to them, as referenced above."

I then received an automated email on XX/XX/XXXX with the header : "" Due today : We haven't received your credit card payment '' alerting me that there was no payment received. When I called back into the automated number on my statement, I did not have any pending or posted payments from the XX/XX/XXXX payment and so I made another minimum payment to make sure I paid my bill on time. Both of these payments were deducted and I have received my latest statement with the XX/XX/XXXX payment dated that day for both transaction and posting and the XX/XX/XXXX payment which means I was forced to overpay to Wells Fargo because there system did not capture my XX/XX/XXXX payment.

I had no knowledge of any of this until I decided to call Wells Fargo because I noticed that my Wells Fargo platinum credit card was closed.

Ive opened an investigation to try to reverse all of this so I can finish pay off XXXX XXXX in full and reopen my Wells Fargo visa platinum card but I was told they can not do that meanwhile the payment that was made to XXXX XXXX was made by my ex wifes bank account which when I called Wells Fargo they said that payment wouldnt have gone through unless it was my account being debited they even went as far as providing me the account number of my ex wifes bank account and saying it was my account which it was clearly not.

I called Wells Fargo fraud department on XX/XX/XXXX and reported, in detail, every occurrence of fraud on my account, as stated previously there were 19 episodes of fraud that began on XX/XX/XXXX and ended on XX/XX/XXXX.

'' I immediately contacted Wells Fargo customer service via telephone to inform them that there had been a mistake, there was no fraud on the account. I had the card, the account had XXXX balance, and there had been no unusual activity. I escalated the concern to Wells Fargo 's executive office because closing this account would wipe out half of my available credit and negatively impact my credit score. I spoke to a representative on a recorded line who informed me that I was correct, the account had maintained a XXXX balance with no signs of visible fraud, that it was likely a mistake on Wells Fargo 's part, that the account would likely be able to be reopened, and that I would receive a call back the next business day. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call back from XXXX XXXX at the executive office stating the account could not be re-opened, due to "" risk ''. At first XXXX XXXX refused to provide me a reason as to why the account had been flagged for "" risk '', but after I requested several more times, he admitted that Wells Fargo had failed to process an old lost card request ON THEIR END, and because of Wells Fargo 's own failure to process the request, the account was inadvertently flagged as "" risk '' and subject to being closed. Despite then admitting on the recorded line that this was not my fault and had nothing to do with me ( other than via a notice they supposedly sent me which I never received ), XXXX XXXX continued to state that the account would not be re-opened, that I would indeed suffer the negative impacts to my credit score, that I should file a complaint with the CFPB, and that I would have to subpoena them for any further information. This is absolutely the worst experience I have ever had with any financial institution, and has directly damaged my credit score, via no fault of my own, a fact Wells Fargo admits but refuses to remedy. Moreover, they wo n't even provide me with the additional information I have requested about my complaint, stating instead I must subpoena them for it. If this situation does n't constitute a whole series of unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices on behalf of Wells Fargo against an innocent consumer ( me ) I do n't know what does."

*No open installment loans. 
*Too many late payments, negative records, collection agency accounts or derogatory public records. 
The first two items are subjective. However, I monitor my three credit bureau reports daily, and I do not have any late payments, negative records, collection agency accounts or derogatory public records on any of my credit reports. I have a perfect payment history for the reporting periods of all three bureaus. 
I called Wells Fargo and asked them to review their decision. They reviewed and sent me the same nonsense reply. 
In light of the massive fraudulent, criminal activity alleged against Wells Fargo for opening accounts that clients never knew about, I find it incredible that they use a bogus excuse to deny a legitimate application from a well qualified applicant."
4941,"On XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to Wells Fargo to use a travel credit. I experienced a very long hold time and once I spoke to someone was told that I had to speak to a specialist to use my credit. I was told I would be contacted in 24 hours which didn't happen. I called back several times only to experience longer hold times. On XX/XX/XXXX I was contacted and the agent told me he could process my request to use my credit and because the credit didn't cover the cost of the plan ticket he took my credit card number to pay for the difference. When I showed up at the airport on XX/XX/XXXX there was no record of the ticket so I had to purchase another ticket at the airport. 

I quickly called Wells Fargo and was put on hold and when I finally spoke to someone I was told I would be contacted in 24 hours which once again didn't happen. It took several days for them to call me back and I was given a supervisor to speak with. That person has been very unresponsive, does not return calls when I am told she will and when I call back I am put on hold for almost an hour. 

This matter has been going on for over two weeks at this point and I am very frustrated. Not only are they not meeting SLAs, the customer service is terrible and at this point I am ready to cancel my card. I have not been given updates on this matter and am still unsure of what happened on XX/XX/XXXX. It has been very frustrating and I work in Operations for another bank. I know how things are suppose to work and the Wells Fargo escalation process isn't working at all. I deserve compensation for all the run around I have experienced as well as for the loss of time.

XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX   reporting me late. There was definitely an error on their part. I was never 30 days late ( XX/XX/2017, XX/XX/2017 ), also I was never 60 days late ( XX/XX/2017, XX/XX/2017 ), lastly I was never 90 days late ( XX/XX/2017, XX/XX/2017 XXXX"
4952,"XX/XX/XXXX approximately XXXX XXXX sent email about the problem to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card. I called at XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX about the problem as well. I explained that according to the balances on my promotions which are no interest if paid in full by a specific date, the balances are exactly the same each month and I pay XXXX a month which is just a few dollars more than the monthly payment. I explained to the customer service agent that the balances were not changing by even a XXXX from one month to the next. Customer service agent said that payments would be applied and a certain amount would be on each balance. I explained the balances were exactly the same each month as though no payments were being made. Customer service agent still holds that the payment is applied to each different balance and in order to pay it so that deferred interest isnt charged for an amount that would run out on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. Looking at statement on all promotional balances, XX/XX/XXXX statement, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX statement, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX There were no changes from month to month. With a payment of XXXX a month even if other money is being paid, how is there not one XXXX going toward these balances. Its like they intentionally apply no money to these balances so that the deferred interest of 28.5 percent will be added to your balance when the date of XX/XX/XXXX is reached. How is this any klind of promotion. I understand paying the balance to avoid interest but this makes it a situation where no matter how things are done the consumer has to pay the entire balance of what was borrowed to avoid the interest payments. So if I borrowed on the original balance XXXX regardless of XXXX a month payment every month, I would have to make an XXXX payment that I specifically tell them to apply on this purchase. XXXX was original amount borrowed, At the least this is deceptive, at the most its intentionally making sure the balance always reaches the promotion date so they can add the deferred interest."

4954,This XXXX bank shows no interest in securing credit card payments made by me over the phone. Because I don't have a bank account with them I need to go thru some person they've hired to take my payment which means I have to give my personal checking account information to some low level employee who does that job. We all are aware of their prior hiring problems. I tried making another payment today XX/XX/XXXX and ended up with an employee working from home who was recording my call. When I told her she would need to turn off her recording when taking my payment she couldn't do that so I was stuck on hold for about 15 minutes while she tried to escalate the calm to someone else. I was not able to be connected to someone else and now might be charged a late fee. There is no excuse for someone recording my bank account information. And there is no excuse for my not being able to execute this transaction automatically over the phone. I've told them many times already this process needs to be automated but they are too cheap to do so. Or they are more interested in trying to get me to open a bank account with them then in ensuring my financial security. Either is inexcusable and they need to be warned to invest in the technology so that any payment by anyone can be made over the phone using an automated system. One can't trust sending them payment by mail anymore as long as XXXX remains the XXXX XXXX either.

The credit card company, Wells Fargo & Company, resolved the dispute in merchant 's favor, stating that I am responsible for the full charge of {$64.00}, because I did not cancel the reoccurring charge, which is the auto pay feature I set up for the internet service plan, despite of the fact that XXXX informed of account balance of {$0.00}, and the fact that I wasn't able to use the full service for the billing period of XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX.

4969,"I am once more submitting a complaint against Wells Fargo for the unsolicited opening of a checking account and the issuance of a credit card. Wells Fargo Case NumberAfter submitting my original complaint on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to the CFPB Wells Fargo began reaching out to me. Each phone call was with a different representative and I had to arduously explain and re-explain the series of events which took place in the opening of this fraudulent account. Each agent at the end of our conversations would tell me that my case was beyond their ability to handle and someone with more authority would be in contact with me shortly. I was also sent checks for our inconvenience, which of course were so low they were more an insult than anything else and we did NOT cash them. After a few months and many re-tellings with many different XXXX representatives, I was asked to participate in a mediation to help resolve the issue. We finally had our mediation on XXXX XXXX with a XXXX mediator, Wells Fargo representative Mr.*******and myself. During the mediation, interesting facts came to light that even I had not been aware of. Mr. XXXX claimed that I did know we had this account because money ( I believe it was {$300.00} he said was transferred ) had been deposited into the account, after I expressly denied this claim, I asked him to track where the money came from, and sure enough the deposited money he claimed I deposited was actually transferred by XXXX from another XXXX account of mine. I was NOT aware of this! Having never been through this process before, I was not aware or did not understand of my need to submit any additional documentation. Even without any additional documentation on my part, the XXXX mediator found I did in fact have a case against XXXX and expressed that the monetary settlement offer he was suggesting was based on NOT having my documentation submitted. During the mediation I was told what documentation would be required to act as further proof of my complaint against XXXX which included 1 ) My mortgage disqualification letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank which states that a delinquent account that went to collections was reason for the withdrawal of their loan approval. 2 ) Proof of our credit score prior to our XXXX XXXX XXXX mortgage pre-approval letter. 
We submitted our XXXX XXXX XXXX denial letter and then Mr. XXXX then requested proof of our credit score prior to the rejection. Before having submitted the credit score documents to XXXX, they sent us a letter stating XXXX is rejecting the mediators monetary settlement suggestion and if we would like to continue with mediation, they do NOT want to use XXXX for the mediation process any longer. I can only assume this is because XXXX  found that we do in fact have a case against XXXX and that their monetary settlement suggested to XXXX would be much more once we submit the documentation they suggested. 
Meanwhile, I continue to struggle to pay XXXX mortgage each month, and now lawyer fees associated with this XXXX complaint and have resorted to sending personal items to auction to make extra money. This whole process from the beginning till now has felt like an exercize in exhausting the victim until they just simply give up. I do not have the option of simply giving up as my family and I have been so deeply impacted by the actions of Wells Fargo. I have a lawyer retained and am ready to see this through. 
Submitted with this complaint is my original complaint submitted XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, the XXXX  mediation : Mediators Proposal, XXXX XXXX XXXX letter of loan-approval withdrawal, XXXX letter titled : Rejection of Mediation Proposal, XXXX credit score of 703 dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX of 680 dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 

XXXXOriginal Complaint Filed In XXXX of XXXX, I went to the XXXX, Pennsylvania branch of Wells Fargo Bank to address a concern about my ex-wife 's name still being on an account used to pay my mortgage each month. 
At that time, branch manager suggested I open a new checking account, in my name only, as a solution to this problem. The next day I returned to actually open that new checking account, and the manager then offered me a credit card account as well. When I asked some questions and found out there would be fees attached to these accounts, I declined to open either a new checking account or a credit card account, and left, to my knowledge, without opening any accounts. 

Mid- XXXX, XXXX, I received a phone call from a debt collector saying I owed money on a personal credit card account I had with Wells Fargo XXXX I responded that I did n't have any such account, but right after the phone call, I went to the XXXX, Pennsylvania branch of Wells Fargo to find out what was going on, and whether this might relate to my business account with Wells Fargo. The bank assured me that the debt did not relate to my business account, but instead related to a personal credit card they insisted I had opened. 

Even though I never received a personal credit card from Wells Fargo, never received any statements and never made any charges, Wells Fargo ultimately informed me that I had {$28.00} in unpaid annual fees. This is after my wife and I had put a bid in on a house, and after that bid was accepted, I also learned that Wells Fargo reported this supposed delinquency to the major credit reporting agencies, which dropped my credit score from roughly 650 to roughly 530. As a result of this huge drop in credit score, we lost the house, and lost the opportunity to reduce our monthly home ownership costs ( including mortgage, taxes and HO insurance ) from {$3800.00} per month to {$1700.00} per month. For the foreseeable future, I am losing {$2100.00} per month as a result of Wells Fargo 's conduct in opening a credit card account in my name and charging me fees without ever even letting me know they had opened a credit account in my name. 

Wells Fargo has opened a case number for my complaint, and it has submitted requests to XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX to remove this alleged credit card delinquency from my name. But the damage is done, and Wells Fargo has not offered any significant compensation for the damage they have caused me."

I believe Wells Fargo actions were based on race, although I had late payments during a covid-19 hardship, I never missed a payment, nor have I made any or attempted to make any purchases during this time. I feel Wells Fargo is singling out minorities and engaged in a deceptive business practice of offer a balance transfer with a higher line of credit then after receiving the business lowers minorities credit limits which is bate and switch to gain business."

4985,"I have a credit card with Wells Fargo that has a zero interest rate. There are 4 promo balances on it. The zero interest rates on the promo balances begin expiring on XX/XX/XXXX. I will have sufficient cash, over the next few months to pay these off ( if Wells Fargo applies them appropriately ie applies the minimum payment first, and then applies the excess payment to the FIRST expiring promo balance, and so on. 

I have contacted Wells Fargo, via email, and each reply simply restates the previous "" we apply Minimum Payment first to lower APR balances ( Purchases ) before balances with higher APRs ( Cash Advances ). Payments made in excess of Minimum Payment will be applied to balances with higher APRs first before balances with lower ones. '' Note : I have never made a purchase on this card. There are only the four promo balances. Wells Fargo did note in their reply that my APR will jump, after the expiration dates of the promo balances, to 18.15 % for Purchases! This is very convenient, as you will note below, that they have refused to allocate my excess payments to the first expiring promo balance, but rather do some kind of broad allocation - 33 % to the first balance / 31 % to the second / 14 % to the third and 21 % to the fourth. I do n't mind them allocating the minimum payment however they wish, but if I pay an extra amount of {$1000.00}, and I want it to be paid to the first expiring balance, I should be permitted to choose this option. 

Their most recent reply - again - the third time in 6 weeks - was ... '' Payments made in excess of the Minimum Payment will be applied to balances with higher APRs first before balances with lower ones. Because your balance consists of four promotional balances of 0 %, each balance will receive a portion of the payment. '' In my most recent communication with them, I offered to call in each time I make an extra payment and indicate that the first balance should be reduced by the payment etc. I have four balances - first one expires XX/XX/XXXX, second one expires XX/XX/XXXX, third one expires XX/XX/XXXX and fourth XX/XX/XXXX. The total I intend to pay between now and XX/XX/XXXX ( excluding minimums ) is about {$11000.00} and will more than adequately pay off the first two balances, if Wells Fargo allocates the payments correctly. 

I have a XXXX XXXX credit card and have promo balances ( 0 % ) on that card. XXXX XXXX does what Wells Fargo will not, they allocate anything in excess of a minimum payment to my first expiring promo balance. I fail to understand the difference. It also seems to me that this Wells Fargo matter is covered under your CFR Section 12 CFR 1026.53 regarding Allocation of Payments - am I correct? 

I would appreciate your assistance with this matter or any further information that you can offer me."

4990,"I entered a consumer credit Transactions with this company with my open ended credit plan. Wells Fargo alleged that I've had alleged unpaid obligation to them, then they processed to charge off and close the credit account. There are no law under the Truth in Lending or FCRA Statutes that stated anything about Late Payments in connection to an open ended credit plan. 
However, 15 USC 1602 states that an account can not be closed without the original creditors written consent. It further states that a natural person can not assume any debt, and pursuant to 18 USC 8 the United States assumes all obligations. Yet, Wells Fargo is attempting to collect an alleged debt from me while harming my consumer reports and my reputation which is a clear violation of 15 USC 1692d ( 1 ). 

To make matters worst, they continue to report the account charged off to the credit reporting agencies every single month for the past 5 years"

4999,"1. Wells Fargo has stated the XXXX XXXX account XXXX has closed per their own guidelines on accounts suspected to have been opened by someone else other than the named person. 

2. Wells Fargo 's identity verification system flagged my application in the beginning because my SSN was issued after the SSA went to a randomized numbering system. 

3. Wells Fargo 's system is discriminatory because it is not up-to-date to deal with these new SSNs. Essentially, Wells Fargo discriminates against new immigrants and will eventually discriminate against a new generation of citizens who were issued SSNs after the number randomization. During the first few calls to Wells Fargo, they asked me where my SSN was issued, which it was issued from Illinois, but the number itself ( based on the older SSN numbering scheme ) would appear as issued from New York. So, I failed that question which led to Wells Fargo requesting my SS card to be sent via fax ; which I had to send multiple times due to Wells Fargo 's inept and inefficient methods in their offices. 

4. Wells Fargo is no longer a reputable banking institution because of their fraudulent and discriminatory actions. 

5. Wells Fargo continues to send me documents and statements about this account despite them stating they do not believe I am the person who opened the account. 

6. Wells Fargo, during a call on XX/XX/2017 on/about XXXX XXXX ET, refused to remove the account from my credit profile and refused to remove the credit inquiry. 

7. The action outlined in item # 6 is illogical if they truly believe the account was opened by some other person."

On XX/XX/2021, when I was at a XXXX in XXXX, NC ( close to my home ) I received a text message ( attached ) from Wells Fargo asking me to verify my purchase activity. The text asked about a {$1000.00} charge at XXXX XXXX NY and then another charge at the same vendor for {$970.00}. I did not reply to that particular text, and I never authorized those purchases. For some reason, Wells Fargo removed the {$1000.00} charge without my intervention but they accepted the {$970.00}. However, they cancelled my credit card, because as I was at XXXX ( XXXX, NC ) my credit card was rejected, which means that they had suspicions of fraudulent activity. I used my debit card ( from the same institution, Wells Fargo ) at that XXXX. I have included screenshots of both the credit card account and the debit card account so that the information showing proof of me being in NC buying at XXXX ( where my credit card was rejected ) is highlighted. XXXX days later, I opened a dispute on the remaining {$970.00}. The whole process has been XXXX. I have spent more than XXXX hours talking to generally unkind and unhelpful representatives. I have asked them to re-open the case XXXX times, and all they say is that my fraud request claim has been denied because "" Since your credit card was in your possession at the time of the transaction, it was concluded that the charge was authorized and the claim was closed. '' While the credit card was indeed in my possession, as I was trying to use it at XXXX, the {$970.00} charge at XXXX XXXX NY is a fraudulent one. I can not be both at the XXXX XXXX in NY and the XXXX at NC, where I live, at the same time. I faxed the same materials that I am attaching here at the request of XXXX of the representatives ; XXXX of them confirmed that they have received them and were considering them. Then a second one denied that I had sent that fax. I did send the fax and I even used the fax at the local branch of Wells Fargo in XXXX XXXX, NC. The XXXX of the branch sent those documents herself and was very kind. At this point, they just want me to accept that I made a purchase in NY and they do not believe me, nor they have considered the proof. I have offered them to contact witnesses, to ask me any questions, and they keep saying that since the card was in my possession and a chip was used and a chip can not be duplicated, that I must have done the purchase.

I am despearte at this point, since it is their word against mine and they refuse to look at the attached materials. Nothing I can do convinces them. Thank you so much for your help, XXXX"

The banker told me that I (female) had an $XXXX limit while my husband received a $XXXX credit limit. I asked the banker why my limit was lower and he could not give me an answer.  Said that's what the system gave us.  I have reported the issue to Wells Fargo Customer Service and to this date they have not told me why my credit was issued at a lower rate.

He stated that my account had been hacked and my card needed to be disabled. He said he would text me a 6 digit code to confirm my idenity., I told him I would need to hang my cell in order to retrieve the text. He said he would call back once I had the text.

The "" executive office '' closed the case without calling me back, which I only found out by calling them back. The case closure notes say that I must hold the "" Reflect '' card ( which I did not apply for ) for at least 6 months before a change can be made. 

I now hold a financial product that I did ask for. I am reporting this because Wells Fargo has a reputation for "" selling '' unsolicited services, and this is another example."
5044,"I had to finance a broken A/C in the summer of XXXX using a Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX card. At the time I setup the card, I elected for paperless billing which in this case, involved the bank posting a PDF of the bill on their website. I also setup online bill pay to pay the minimum amount with a plan to pay off the card before the interest free promotional period. I made an error in my calculations and did not attempt to pay the balance until XX/XX/XXXX, as it turns out, a little over a month from when the period expired on XX/XX/XXXX. I was charged the interest for the promotional period. I contacted the bank on XX/XX/XXXX to see if they could remove the interest as their paperless billing option obfuscated the warnings for the promotional period running out ( they print it on the back page of the bill they post online ). While I acknowledge my responsibility to understand my terms, I think Wells Fargo hides the appropriate information."
5048,"I am using wells Fargo credit card, and setup automatic payment for every month ( statement balance ). past 2 months payment not went through reason email from XXXX ( schduled payment higher than actual payment ) nothing wrong on my side but wells fargo charged me interest & late fee etc., agent not ready to help me"
5052,"On the evening of Sunday XX/XX/XXXX I discovered I had three charges on my Wells Fargo business card from XXXX totaling {$340.00}. My business card was attached to my XXXX account as I made a purchase for the business a year ago on XX/XX/XXXX. I checked my XXXX account and confirmed no unauthorized charges matching the transactions were ever made in my account. I immediately called Wells Fargo and told them I didn't make the charges, that someone must have my card number, and asked that the charge be stopped and a new card issued. I was told that the card will be canceled, a new number issued, and to report the Fraud in the morning on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo and reported the fraud and I was informed that I would be credited back and that an investigation would take place and completed within 20 days. I was never given the credit and received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX in the mail that Wells Fargo completed their investigation and determined the charges were valid. On XX/XX/XXXX I called the fraud department and informed them I didn't make these charges and I had proof showing purchases made on my XXXX account and also shipping addresses listed to the account. When I asked what items were purchased and where they shipped to-I was told that they would provide me their investigating documents in the mail, and they would open a secondary investigation allowing me to produce my documents. I received said documents dated XX/XX/XXXX in the mail which stated the vendor ( XXXX ) was able to verify my name and credit card information. I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX in the mail stating that Wells Fargo completed their investigation and found charges valid for the second time. My documentation was never asked for and no follow up was conducted by Wells Fargo with me as to acquire my proof through documentation. On Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Wells Fargo and requested a Manager for the fraud department and for a third time complained that I didn't make said charges, advised I had documentation, asked why I wasn't allowed to provide it, why they let the pending charge post, and whether or not their secondary investigation obtained the shipping addresses proving that I had never received any items? I was told a case would be filed with an escalation team member and was transferred to a Wells Fargo Fraud Advocate who informed me they opened a case, gave me the case number, contact number, and told I would be notified by the case agent within 24-48hours and that I would be given the opportunity to provide my documentation and that it will be investigated. I received no contact and on XX/XX/XXXX I called the Escalation number and explained everything and was informed that the case agent reached out to me via US Mail on XX/XX/XXXX ( which I still haven't received ) I was then informed that he would contact me within 24 hours. Today on XX/XX/XXXX, Case agent called me and informed me that unfortunately the fraud case had been closed and there was nothing he could do. I asked about forwarding my documentation and was informed that he would have to request that the fraud department handle this, that he could not accept it. I was then transferred back to the very same Fraud Department who transferred me to the Escalation Case Agent and after questioning them as to what supporting evidence they had that the charges were valid, I was told the Vendor was able to verify my name, email, address, and card number. Wells Fargo never obtained shipping addresses or what was purchased from XXXX. I was then told that the matter was closed, but I could fax supporting documentation and a letter with my credit card account information on it and Statement to them and they may consider it. I have to fight this hard for {$340.00} worth of unauthorized charges I did not make. I also have filed a Police Report as of today and I am waiting for a permanent case number."
5053,"I sent payment of {$75.00} before the due date they have not received it. I sent it through Wells Fargo Bill Pay I sent a request they inquire about the payment. XXXX XXXX calls me every other day reguarding payment I informed them that I have asked Wells Fargo to investigate. I have even sent XXXX XXXX the case number. But they keep calling asking the same questions 1 ) my phone number, address, and about payment they keep saying they will make a note but they keep call asking the same questions."
5054,"I had a secured credit card with Wells Fargo. After roughly a year of consistently paying the credit card off each month ahead of schedule, they offered to switch my card to a non-secured credit card. I accepted the offer and thus they created a new card for me. The old, secured credit card was supposed to be closed automatically. 

Unfortunately, that did not happen and somehow transactions continued to occur on the card and worst of all payments I tried to make some how began to show as transaction amounts I owed. Subsequent fees and late notices appeared on the account. 

My wife and I have tried multiple times to work with Wells Fargo. The only people we get on the phone can't help us and the group they send us to doesn't appear to exist. We have spent endless hours trying to resolve this with Wells Fargo and at this point we don't have the time to continue to pursue this issue with them to no end."
5055,"I received a Well Fargo - XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX in the mail yesterday. I never applied for this card and when i try to call the company and report this i get the XXXX XXXX store CC dept. I can't call the XXXXXXXX XXXX  dept until Monday morning. If i am trying to report a fraudulent card, i should have access to someone 24 hours a day"
5063,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call from Wells Fargo regarding my Wells Fargo Credit Card. The rep stated the payment is late and the minimum amount of {$25.00} is due. I explained to the rep that I have not received my bill for this account. Ive never missed a payment for any of my accounts. The payment due was only {$25.00}. When I was informed the payment was late I immediately went online and paid the full balance off. Even though I am also a victim of the natural disaster. I lost my job in XX/XX/XXXX when the state mandated a lock down. The company I worked for went out of business. I wasnt able to find employment until XX/XX/XXXX. They said we can set up a deferment if I wasnt able to make the payments. I explained that I dont need a deference I only need to make sure my credit report doesnt show any late or missed payments. The rep stated that as long as the balance was paid in full they agreed to not report the late payment on my credit file. They didnt add anything on my credit report showing any missed or late payments. In XXXX of XXXX over one year later, for some reason Wells Fargo went back on their word and my credit report showed a late payment for the month of XX/XX/XXXX. 

When I called Wells Fargo and explained the situation they said they dont have any way to remove it from my report. Ive been a Wells Fargo customer for over 10 years. Never missed any payment prior to that one payment that was late. 

Ive called many times and I tried explaining that I never received my bill it never came in the mail and they are required to send me a bill every month. I told them that I am a victim of a declared national disaster. That should be enough right there to remove this inaccurate information from my report. I made the payment exactly like I was told and then updated my address because they had the wrong mailing address in the system. 

I called another time and a rep stated she will send my request over to a special department and they will remove the late payment due to my long relationship with Wells Fargo and that there was never any other late payment on the account."
5065,Wells Fargo statement XX/XX/17. I had a total cash advance charge for {$240.00} billed to my signature card. This was for overdraft protection fees from another account. I am being charged at 24.74 % interest. The complaint is there is not a way to pay off the cash advance. I have searched my online account but there is no way to pay it off. I called Wells Fargo and they said there is not an option to pay it off. <P/>This can be a major issue over time because its not upfront - its identified on page 3 of the statement.If any other overdraft charges accumulated then you are stuck with high interest continuing to build until the account is closed.
5066,"On XX/XX/21 I attempted to use a ATM machine to withdraw {$500.00}. After entering pin and entering amount no money came out but an error message said because I took too long to remove the money it was was returned inside the machine ( but the money never came out ). But, the account was debited {$500.00}. This machine has a history of malfunctioning which Wells Fargo admits to. Knowing this Wells Fargo says, we have to wait up to 10 days for them to investigate. This is a hardship, we have bills to pay and we need our money now.

5075,"Wells Fargo has notified me of XXXX and XXXX fraudulent charges. I asked them to. Lose card. They read a closure telling me they are transferring it to a new card. 
I went through the same thing months ago with Wells Fargo and closed the card however they reissued a new card."
5076,"I was used the cell phone app XXXX  on Saturday XXXX to make specific crypto rate purchases. Each time I attempted to process an order, it either timed out, indicated the rate I was asking for is no longer available, or indicated there was a problem with my card. I made 4 attempts and finally gave up. I confirmed with my Wells Fargo app there were 4 pending charges. I did call Wells Fargo to unlock my card because of the multiple attempts I had locked it.

Later that day I had another opportunity to buy a token at a specific rate but again, it timed out so I was discouraged to make any more purchases. 
Later that evening when I came back home I emailed XXXX about my app account but have yet to get a response back. I have attached that email. At the time I thought there were 4 charges for a specific crypto token. I only wanted to place one order. Informed both bank and crypto.com I did not want 3 of the 4 charges.

The following day, Sunday, I received messages on the cell phone app that all orders ( 5 ) were placed. I did not approve of those order and the rates for one of them was not what I placed originally. I called Wells Fargo to initially dispute all charges but clarified to only dispute one
charge which was over {$5000.00}. Why I am disputing that is because they fraudulently used my card without my approval Sunday. Also, the rate on the token they gave me was higher than what I was originally asking for Saturday.

I then called Wells Fargo and put in a dispute/fraud claim as that charge was not authorized.

They are "" investigating '' right now and because it is a large amount, the High Dollar Department is looking into this. They have done their initial investigation and have denied the claim. Claiming Crypto.com received approval from me. On Saturday, yes, that specific moment when I tried to place my order, there was approval. But having the order placed on Sunday, no, that was not my approval. I have called Wells Fargo XXXX to expedite a call back from that department, hopefully, I can get a call within 24 hours but it may be until Monday as they are still investigating.

What they are investigating, I don't know? It's just one charge I need to be turned over because it was not approved by me. I have a feeling they will deny my request again but will wait patiently for a callback."

I Also have one Wells Fargo bank N.A credit card that is open and should remain open and I never requested it to be closed. The account I am complaining about can be pulled up with the above information and it is shown the full number of it in one of the attached files. Also my attached recording of proof shows what account exactly that i requested to be close but I faced unexplained refusal and/or resistance so I called again Wells Fargo but they impeded my ability and my request to close that account and keep it open against my will .I believe I was discriminated and retaliated against another time and by the same bank. My struggle : Wells Fargo Bank N.A ( WF ) discriminated, blacklisted and retaliated against my person and violated my rights to engaging in protected activities under the the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 2010 ( CFPA ). In addition to that, WF violated my rights under Title VI and any other as applicable from WF retaliation against my person as it will be explained herein and/or will be explained further elsewhere due to privacy and for security and safety reasons. I complained before about Wells Fargo bank N.A discrimination or reataliation to the government and this Bank is aware of it and continues its reckless intentional arrogance to target my person and blacklisted my information. the following is the latest from WF or Wells Fargo Bank National Association unlawful, discriminatory and relatiatiry acts against my person : on XXXX XXXX I called my WF credit card services or WF customers phone bank to request and close a WF account number that was opened under my social security number and under my other personal information and it has the last 4 consecutive digits XXXX ( account XXXX ) ( full account number is shown in an attached file ). This Account XXXX is shown as separate account in the WF online banking. Wells Fargo bank N.A refused to close this account when I clearly requested that in a first and a second same day on XX/XX/XXXX ). The two calls give enough chance to this Tyrant- mafia like organized bank to refrain from its refusal to close my account but they insisted and they did not close my account XXXX. Now, I authorize one of the two calls them to be public as permitted and as CFPB sees it it protects my rights and it is attached to this complaint and the CFPB to go ahead and do so please but resricted to government authorities a restriction that Only my consent or a court order that might left it. Those Two calls are my recorded privileged calls of me to Wells Fargo bank N.A proving that unlawfuly rejected request to close my account XXXX and twice.Thus, After that refusal to my ligitimate requests to close account XXXX and to my current state of belief and understating and without waiving my rights Under any circumstances, I believe I never signed any account application for that account XXXX and so its terms and conditions do no represent in any way something signed or agreed to it so whatever those terms and/or conditions of account XXXX Represents WF Only.

Wells Fargo Bank N.A by retaliating, discrimination and blacklisting my person using my information has declared its continuous outlaw and disrespect to the constitution. Who has jurisdiction and could stop this? I said it before and again I will never hurt myself or any other/s and if anything to happen to safety and life Wells Fargo Bank National Association and/or its involved agents and/or its involved executives should all individually and/or collectively be held criminally fully legally responsible and should be prosecuted to be sentenced to maximum possible sentence/s in a court of law and thus If I left forced and/or against my will by the above named, and it would be a fact then that I left as a martyr to the Unitited States, Country, Citizens and its Constitution and to our democracy and values and what an honor it wouldve be.

5082,"On XX/XX/XXXX I used my Wells Fargo Visa credit card to purchase a XXXX XXXX XXXX trip that I was solicited via telephone. When speaking to the sales person I inquired about the various places I would like to travel to, for example XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. I was told yes they had resorts in those locations so I proceeded to purchase the package for {$1100.00}. This was the first time I used this credit card. I called the credit card company on the day I made the purchase because the card was turned down. In speaking with the credit card customer service I asked if I changed my mind in a couple of days could I cancel the purchase, this was on a Friday evening so I had the weekend to change my mind. That Monday morning I called the credit card company to cancel the purchase because I had recieved an email with the various resorts they offered. None of the locations I had requested was included in the resorts. When I called XXXX XXXX XXXX about my concerns I was told they may offer resorts in the areas I was interested in at a later time. I informed them I wanted to cancel my trip. On that same day I called my Visa Credit card and requested they cancel the purchase. I was told that the purchase did not show on the card and that they would cancel but I should follow up in writing. I faxed them in writing the reason for my cancellation. In XX/XX/XXXX the charge was deleted from my account. In XX/XX/XXXX this charge reappeared on my XX/XX/XXXX billing account. I called the Visa Wells Fargo to see why they put it back on my account. I was told something about a third party charge and they would not take it off. They insisted that I use the trip. When I tried to book my trip around XX/XX/XXXX ( trip expiration is XX/XX/XXXX ) I was told by XXXX XXXX XXXX that my trip was under dispute and I could not book it. Once again I contacted my Wells Fargo Visa credit card company to help me resolve the dispute issue. On a three way recorded call the credit card company told the Vacation sales person that they had charged me the amount and they had been paid. After much discussion, the credit card company agreed to send written documentation that they had paid the trip and that I was being charged. I still have problems about getting information on the various resorts and what is offered at the resorts they offer. I no longer trust this company and because I had initionally requested the credit card company cancel this charge ( before it was charged to my account ) it should be removed from my credit card."
5083,"They make a payment due on the XX/XX/XXXX of the month and then if you make a payment after the 16th they may or may not apply it to the next month. I made a payment to them on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX and XXXX for my XX/XX/XXXX. payment., Then I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX and XXXX for my XX/XX/XXXX payment. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of XXXX dollars for my XX/XX/XXXX payment. Now they are saying that I have to pay them another XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX or they will charge me {$37.00} late fee. They will not wave this. They said that they charge us on the XX/XX/XXXX, but they do not close out the month until the XX/XX/XXXX so any payment made before that date gets applied to the same month even though I had already had a bill for that month. I should be able to make a payment for the next month as soon as the due date for that month has passed. This is a ridiculous business practice one it seems like they do just to generate late fees. I have to pay my bill when I have the money. I am thinking about starting a lawsuit against them for unfair business practices. We get paid on XX/XX/XXXX and I want to make my XX/XX/XXXX but low and behold it wo n't be applied to XX/XX/XXXX!  Ridiculous!"
5084,"Most Wells Fargo credit card users also have a checking account with the bank. When they make payment from their personal checking account by transferring to their credit card, the fund is deducted from their checking account right away but doesn't post on the credit card right away. It can take up to 5 days to show payment on the credit card. This is done in purpose to charge interest on the credit card while holding the fund in the bank 's account for cash-flow. This should be illegal and unethical holding customer payment while charging interest for what is already paid. This has been happening for a very long time and hopefully there is a way to stop it. 
This happens only on personal credit cards, for business credit cards they actually process it right away because they know business owners understand cash-flow and interest charge."
5085,"Over 3 years ago, in XX/XX/XXXX I signed up for a WellsFargo Secured CreditCard in an effort to help turn around my low credit score. I sat with a gentleman at the WellsFargo Branch in XXXX XXXX, XXXX WA. He assured me that my security of XXXX XXXX dollars would be returned to me after a year of good standing. He told me that if I work on re-building my credit in other ways ( paying off past debt, getting unsecured credit cards, and maintaining a positive track record ) that my security funds would be returned to me after a year. In the meantime I used the card, maintained a great record and followed his advice. Much to my dismay I learned that this policy was not a policy of Wells Fargo. I was misinformed. In fact, when I reached out on my anniversary date in XX/XX/XXXX they could n't even tell me WHY I was n't receiving my security back. Only that it 's at WellsFargo 's  discretion. I asked in many different ways how I could ensure that I 'd get my security back sooner than later and they told me ways to build my credit but they would not tell me why WellsFargo had made a negative determination about returning my security funds. Nor would they give me a timeline that would provide me a reasonable expectation. At that point, I had already entered myself into the class action lawsuit against WellsFargo regarding fraudulent accounts, inappropriate fees, etc. I communicated on multiple dates to multiple customer service representatives that I felt very vulnerable and that it felt suspicious to me that Wells Fargo was literally holding my money without any legitimate reason or timeline provided. They assured me that a monthly review would take place and that when the card is unsecured I 'll be notified via snail mail but that no further information could be given. 

I have since paid 4 of my 7 outstanding debts that have been weighing down my credit. I have since received 4 unsecured credit cards exceeding several thousand dollars in total  available credit. I have since raised my credit score from the low XXXX 's to the high XXXX 's ( according to creditwise ). I have had a XXXX balance on this credit card for nearly 6 months now. I am not sure what more I can do to convince WellsFargo that I am a trustworthy consumer. I also find it odd that even though WellsFargo employees continue to tell me they are taking a look at my credit monthly to make a determination - none of the reporting agencies have any documentation that WellsFargo has ever once checked my credit over the last several years! I feel like I 'm being bullied and given false information. In response I cancelled all checking/savings accounts with the bank hoping that they would see a red flag in a long-term relationship of 18 years being severed. 

This is my oldest line of credit and cancelling the card will have a detrimental affect on my overall credit score. Which I feel is counter productive to why I got the card in the first place. None of the promises I received from WellsFargo have been kept and though I have been a customer of theirs for nearly 2 decades I feel that I 'm receiving no individual service or acknowledgement from them. They continue to charge me fees related to a secured credit card and its beginning to feel like they are holding my hard earned money hostage. I want to have a positive relationship with WellsFargo but they seem driven only by how much money I can give them - rather than helping me be the best consumer I can be. I do not want WellsFargo to control my life anymore and they have already had a horrible impact on my family 's life ( hence the class action suit ). What can I do to remain a long term customer with this bank but receive the service I have worked hard to receive?"
5086,"On XX/XX/2021, I opened a credit card account with Wells Fargo ( Active Cash ). As a condition of opening this account, I was eligible to receive a {$200.00} bonus if I spend {$1000.00} within the next three months. By XXXX, XXXX, 2021 I spend over {$2400.00}, I reached that objective, and called Wells Fargo By XXXX, 2021 to inquire about when I would receive the {$200.00} bonus. The customer service rep I spoke to said she did not know when I would receive the bonus but told me I should get an answer in the next ten days. This despite the fact that I had paid my bills with the account every single timeI been seen some unusual activity on the account I have closed it for about 2 times, unusual charges i have the suspicious that is simply because I achieved the goal to receive the {$200.00} bonus."
5088,"Wells Fargo denied me a credit card and lied about the reason for the denial. I have both a mortgage and second mortgage with Wells Fargo for over 13 years with never a missed or late payment. On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I visited https : //www.wellsfargo.com/ and saw an advertisement for a consumer credit card that offered {$200.00} in cash reward bonus with a minimum use qualifier. It also offered cash reward point accumulation of 1.5 % on all purchases.
I filled out the online application which really only asked for gross income and personal identifying information. I received a letter datedXX/XX/XXXX in which they stated they denied the credit card request based on the reason : "" Credit references provided ca n't be verified ''. I gave them no specific credit reference in my application. Specifically, they state they are unable to get a credit report from XXXX for me. I called them shortly after receiving the letter and filed a verbal complaint. The call was escalated to a man in their "" executive office ''. The basis of my complaint is that on their web site I can see my own FICO score, so it is obvious they not only can but have routinely pulled a credit report on me. I have excellent credit. I did state on the application that all of my income is sourced from retirement. I conjecture they denied credit because I am retired.  Regardless, whatever their reason is, it is not because they ca n't verify that I have excellent credit. I received a second letter dated XX/XX/XXXX in which they stated that after investigating themselves, they determined they have done nothing wrong. This is probably the second lie."
5089,"Back in XXXX of 2016 I purchased some furniture from Bassett furniture, and decided to use the wellsfargo card they offered and utilize the promotion they had. It was deferred interest for a year I made three sepetate purchases. One was for a large amount the other two were smaller amounts. Throughout the course of the year I made payments toward my balance with the understanding from them that all the money I was paying was going toward the main first promotional balance. I am close to the end of my first promotion and was going over numbers and realized that the money I was paying all this time was indeed not going to my main promotion. When I called them to ask what was going on, I was informed that I did not have a credit card but a loan. I began to explain to him I did n't take out a loan I had have a credit card, a XXXX card, and that every month I get a credit card statement. He decided to continue to belittle my intelligence and offer no help, rather pass me off to a supervisor. I spoke briefly to the supervisor and he said that I should of known this was how they operated, that he would get back with me, but never spoke about how out of the twenty times I called over the course of the year the employees should n't of lied to me. I would of not made any purchases with them had I know this, much less numerous ones. PLEASE do not for any reason use wellsfargo bank card service for any reason. They do not operate like any other card companies at all, they make sure you are undable to pay off any of your balance on time, and will lie and twist the truth to get you to use them. I have used many promotions and neve have I been scamed like this."
5097,"During my investigations into a fraudulent withdrawal, I discovered erroneous billing through my credit card. I had booked a trip through a travel agent and paid with my credit card for {$4300.00}. There was an existing balance of about {$4000.00}. Later on that week. I had made a cash payment on the credit card for {$4600.00}. However, I recently discovered that Wells Fargo did not charge my card, rather issued a cash advance. My payment of {$4600.00} was allocated to my purchases and not my higher interest rate cash advance balance. This error increased my interest charges unfairly and outside of the scope of our agreement."
5098,"On XX/XX/21, fraud was committed on my checking and credit card accounts with Wells Fargo. 
{$7200.00} was sent via cash advance from the platinum credit card into the checking account. 
From the checking account, the perpetrator wired the {$7200.00} ( from the credit card ), along with around {$2000.00} ( from my checking ) to another account. A wire transfer fee of {$30.00} was charged to my checking, a {$360.00} cash advance fee & {$61.00} interest charge were charged to my credit card. Theyve since reversed the fees and told me that they have resolved the issue by granting a credit of {$420.00} to the credit balance. Leaving a {$6700.00} credit balance that they want me to be responsible for. My accounts were wiped clean due to wire fraud and the lack of preventative action from Wells Fargo. 

I reported this to WELLS FARGO on the day that this occurred & communicated that I did NOT authorize any of these transactions. Representative filed a claim and assured me that this issue would be investigated & resolved. Also, I was told that the issue would be addressed and my funds restored within 10 business days. I have called regularly to check in on the status but there is still no resolution. 

Despite Wells Fargo having years of transaction records for me, it still failed to identify and protect me from the fraud when it was clear that my bank accounts showed extremely irregular banking activity. 

The fraudster was able to gain access to my online Wells Fargo account by having my login, and proceeded to complete a cash advance from my credit card to checking account, and wire transfer thousands of dollars to a bank unfamiliar to me and to which I do not hold an account with, all without my consent. 

At no time during any of the transactions or before did any Wells Fargo employee or representative take any action to halt the cash advance or wire transfer or protect me from fraudulent activity related to my online account actions. 

Despite the extremely irregular and large transfers in a very short period of time, occurring in my Wells Fargo account and the unauthorized remote logins, Wells Fargo failed to timely act, secure and protect my money. 

Wells Fargo owed a contractual and fiduciary duty to protect my ( the consumer ) funds, due to the company breaching its own Deposit Account Agreement by failing to take proper action to stop the fraud and by failing to immediately recall the wire transfer, which Wells Fargo neither flagged or attempted to stop. 

Wells Fargo committed negligence/voluntary assumption of duty, breach of contract, and violating unfair trade practices and consumer protection law. 

All of the money in my account is gone and the credit card has been maxed out by the scammers. I have been told by Wells Fargo multiple times that I should stay calm and trust that they will address this issue. They have not. Wells Fargo representatives have told me repeatedly that this is clearly fraud- they even told me that theyve noticed the trend of fraud occurring in several of their customers accounts, yet the company is unsure of how to resolve it. I have received letters and responses from Wells Fargo that state the complete opposite of what the representatives have said. Instead of nullifying the fraudulent transactions, Wells Fargo has made efforts to gaslight me in these written responses by stating that they found the transfer was requested through an online banking session using your username and password. As a result, we determined you or someone who had your permission performed the transaction. Representatives and the WF investigators have acknowledged that they have had other consumers where their accounts were able to be accessed by hackers, which allows for fraudulent transactions to occur. WHY would I go through all of this XXXX, frustration, exhaustion and emotional turmoil if I had been the one to take out the money? These actions by Wells Fargo are beyond SHAMEFUL and UNACCEPTABLE. Ive lost trust in Wells Fargo and banks in general. Not only have I been victimized by the scammers/hackers, Wells Fargo has perpetuated their own abuse and negligence by dragging me through this whole ordeal when they are fully aware that what happened to my accounts was a result of FRAUD. Stop trying to gaslight your customers, Wells Fargo! 

I will be getting an attorney and I am contacting the news to bring these concerns to light."

However, Wells Fargo has refused to remove a significant portion of the charges, claiming that the signature on the receipts matches the signature they have on file for me. First, when stolen, my card contained my signature -- a signature that even a child could replicate. Second, the signatures are NOT the same. Third, this is the ONLY "" proof '' they are going by. The proof is cryptic, vague and inconclusive. Wells Fargo is handing their hat on it to avoid liability, despite touting a zero liability protection benefit. Also, I requested the documentation for the charges they DID remove and they have not provided them to me. 

I disputed these charges in accordance with Fair Credit Billing Act. Not only does Wells Fargo itself promote "" zero liability '' protection, the FCBA also affords me similar protection. If all it takes is for a fraudster to create a "" similar '' simple signature, the "" protection '' is illusory. 

I demand further proof other than a claim that the signatures appear similar.

Their reasoning was that "" Since your card was in your possession at the time of the transaction, we have concluded that the charge was authorized.

This seems to me like terrible reasoning. There are well documented instances and methods of Fraud that can occur while the owner is still in possession of the card.

A month later I received a letter stating that my claim was denied because my card was present and in my possession. This does not make sense to me because I am not in possession of my card 100 % of the time. For example, when I hand the card to a waiter or employee to charge then the card leaves my possession and sight. This also happened outside the United States in a place not celebrated for their lack of crime. 

To help my claim, I even submitted a report with my local police department at Wells Fargos request.

I do not have the exact date for that though. 

Once we arrived in XXXX I was able to find a visitor information office that allowed me to download and print out my bank statements for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. I underlined all the fraudulent charges made on my credit card beginning on XX/XX/XXXX and ending on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I contacted Wells Fargo Bank and filed a fraud claim around XX/XX/XXXX when we arrived in XXXX. My claim was denied by the fraud department Vice President XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating that since I had made a payment on my outstanding balance that I had authorized the charges and that is their policy in the fraud department. 

I told them that these charges were not authorized and was told by the fraud department that I could send a letter to the Reconsideration Department listing the details of my case. They asked me if I had filed a police report about the fraud, which I find ludicrous because I was in a foreign country and the fraud occurred in the United States in California, Florida, and New York starting the day after we departed on our cruise and continuing until XX/XX/XXXX. 

I did type out a letter with all the fraudulent charges listed with the dates they occurred as well as sending copies of our travel documents to prove we were not in the United States during the fraudulent time period. Again I received two letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX, Senior Vice President Credit Card Fraud Claims Department dated XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX.

She did not have an answer for me.

5181,"My credit report is showing a late payment from XXXX of 2018. At the time I didn't think much of it but now my credit score is being heavily affected by it in spite of my otherwise excellent track record.

At the time I never received any correspondence from Well Fargo that a payment was late until it had already been over 30 days past due. I remember making the minimum payment as soon as I noticed the balance, but the blemish still remains on my credit report. I have asked WF a few times to fix it but they haven't, so it still shows up as a delinquency. 

I've attached images of bank statement emails from XXXX and XXXX of that year, and it's clear that the minimum payment went back to the normal ( {$58.00} ) in XX/XX/2018, indicating I paid what was overdue. I would include statements, but those are unfortunately no longer available from the website. 

I have been a long-time client of Wells Fargo and this is the only blemish on an otherwise perfect track record."

5184,"I have been with Wells Fargo since the 1990s, and have also been in business since that time. This morning, I was solicited by a Wells Fargo Bank Personal Banker, in the branch, for a "" Wells Fargo Business Credit Card ''. Although I immediately declined interest ( as I have enough revolving credit available already ), the employee tried to sell me on the fact that "" this business card would build the business 's credit ''. Being very familiar with Wells Fargo 's "" sales practices '' and their history of unethical credit sales practices ( for which they have been fined in the past by the U.S. government ) ; AND, my knowledge and experience with business credit, I expressed my skepticism to the banker. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, and allow her to address my reticence, but she became quite defensive, argumentative, and rude. So, I stuck to my declination, and decided to look into her claims later. I've now done that, and not surprisingly, she was lying through her teeth ( as I suspected ). According to XXXX ( since Wells Fargo does not make the necessary information readily available online ), like most retail "" business '' credit cards, they "" do not help build your business credit ''. The reason I am so upset, is because not only has Wells Fargo been punished for unethical practices involving their credit products in the past, but most customers are not as savvy about credit as I am, and I know that this dishonest practice has undoubtedly enticed countless others into availing themselves of this Wells Fargo product, for a promised benefit that is not available. I also know this is not an isolated issue, because I've received the same dishonest "" pitch '' for this exact same product for decades, from employees in branches across the country. What made this occasion more objectionable, is the attitude that the employee had. Previous employees have acknowledged their lack of understanding and certainty about the false claim ; this one became defensive, argumentative, and rude -- another tactic that likely coerces customers of a different constitution. Since unnecessary credit has a tangibly negative impact on consumers, I believe that this issue ought to be adequately investigated by the CFPB, and that they should hold Wells Fargo accountable for the continued pattern of unethical credit sales practices ( since they clearly have not learned their lesson from the last round of fines )."
5187,"I obtained a secure credit card from wells fargo in XXXX. I was told that if i pay my bill on time that my card would graduate to a regular credit card ; later i was told there were other factors involved in the graduation process. from then on every time i inquire about the cards graduation status they tell me for different reasons my card is not eligible to graduate. they never disclose the exact reasons why, they only say maybe your credit score is too low or there are negative items on your credit. when asked if there is a threshold for credit scores they say they dont know. when asked what are the negative things on my credit they dont know. they cant tell me what my credit score is or what specifically is negative on my credit report so that i may address it. they continually deny the graduation of my card and do not provide a adverse action notice."
5188,I did not apply for a wellsFargo Credit card back in XXXX I went into the bank and spoke with a representative about this issue. I did not authorize However they send me a record of the application and reference number and we still going back and fourth and I did not tell no associate nor bank representative my mother / grandmother did anything this is absolutely unacceptable. It really XXXX me off because she been deceased since XXXX. Yes Wells Fargo showing me documentation but at the same time how about show pictures/ or the voice recording of the conversation that me and the bank representative had. Any body can present documents However still does not justified the fact that the credit card was fraudulent!!!
5189,"This is XXXX XXXX, who is submitting this CFPB complaint myself, and to inform you that there is no third party involved in the process. This account is inaccurately and erroneously reporting. Their intentional and willful furnishing of inaccurate information is a violation of FCRA Section 623 and according to FCRA Section 611. I have done many attempts to reach out to THE 3 Credit Bureaus but they failed to give me any results or feedbacks about this concern. Please investigate and remove it from my personal credit file. Thank you."
5190,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, OR XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Dear Wells Fargo, Back in XXXX of this year I had finally filed a complaint against Wells Fargo XXXX Credit Card with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - Case number : XXXX, due to processing violations, lack of billing consistency and poor customer service to correct problems. 

Since then, XXXX closed my card, once again increased my interest rate and applied a penalty to my card because XXXX has been sending my bills to the wrong address. The card belonging to XXXX XXXX had been sent to her address - she did not pay nor did she forward me the bill. The card for XXXX XXXX has been sent to the correct address and has been paid. 

I tried to call XXXX Credit Card department multiple times to fix these problems. If I made contact with a person, I was hung up on for pointing out their inflexibility to assist with my situation in the wake of your own fraud. My call usually got lost within their automated system ; being transferred and looped through, only to be disconnected. 

I am drowning in penalties and interest that has been tacked onto my account through XXXX XXXX purposeful manipulation of the system. This is unacceptable. My personal credit cards have had none of these issues. This is one more way Wells Fargo has falsified information and engaged in illegal business practices to meet their financial goals. There is no ethical consideration for the harm and stress you are inflicting on people and small businesses. 

I am requesting you cut my debt in half and reduce my interest rate for the current bankrate because half of the debt is from the penalties and interest rates you have compounded due to XXXX XXXX illegal manipulations. 

Disgusted Client, XXXX XXXX Cc : Oregon Department of Justice Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Federal Trade Commission XXXX - I received a credit card application from Wells Fargo, after they closed my business account. They are still trying to open accounts to meet their financial goals despite all the illegal activity theyve been caught participating in. Credit card debt is at an all time high - this is XXXX of the major factors."
5191,"I applied for a Secured Card from Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXXwith the hope to build credit history and on their word heard that I would be able to apply to upgrade to a credit card when my credit score is built up. I had to keep a deposit of {$300.00} and so I did. I stepped in the bank one year later, in XX/XX/XXXX requesting to fill the application for upgrading to the regular credit card and I was denied the request to upgrade because I am not a XXXX XXXX of this country. That seems unfair and un-moral given the prior information they gave me when I applied for the secure credit card. This is a warning which should be given prior because I am now stuck with a secure card, paying a yearly fee, with {$300.00} of my earned money stuck with a bank."
5197,"On XX/XX/2021, My credit card was closed by Wells Fargo Bank, the bank do not indicate any reason. And the reward account link to that card goes to XX/XX/XXXXafter closing, there is no way to redeem all the rewards."
5200,I opened a Cashwise Visa Signature card with Wells Fargo Bank in XXXX of XXXX. I was assigned a credit limit of {$7200.00}. I made one charge of {$610.00} in XXXX of XXXX and have been paying on time ever since. I just received a letter from Wells Fargo in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX and much to my surprise they lowered my credit line from {$7200.00} to {$700.00}. The letter indicated my credit line was lowered as I did not have a Wells Fargo Checking or Savings account or any other line of business that they offer. I called their customer service line and they apologized for what was happening but made no effort to save me as a customer. I have had Auto and Home loans since XXXX and a Platinum Visa since XXXX. If they are trying to rebrand their image they have failed.
5201,"Wells Fargo, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, SD XXXX branch and headquarters owes me a {$50.00} refund after I paid {$50.00} on a pre-pay debit card that was never applied to my account and closed by Wells Fargo in XX/XX/2020. I was told by the Wells Fargo XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX customer service number a {$50.00} check would be mailed, and should arrive in early XXXX and it never did arrive, only Wells Fargo Card Services billing statement showing - {$50.00} charging my bank account frivolously."
5202,I have opted out of all advertisement from Wells Fargo and am now reviving credit card offers as well as soft pulls on my credit report from them. I have not accounts other then a mortgage with them. The opt-out from advertisement should cover all items and services. In addition they inquired about credit with out permission in their credit card services. When bring the issue to their attention I waited on hold for XXXX hours only to be hung up on! Opt out means do not contact unless is regarding current accounts. Not here is a credit card offer!
5204,I was paying my monthly payments on time and everytime. Today I received a letter from wells fargo that they have lowered my credit limit from {$7000.00} to {$5100.00}. Their decision has brought my account within near the maximum limit. Therefore it will further have a negative effect on my credit score. I deem their decision to be of a discriminative and unfair business practice. I am a XXXX year old XXXX senior citizen. I no longer work but i was trying my best to keep up the payments and keep the account in good standing unitl they decided to take this inhumane action. We have been and still are in the middle of a pandemic and they take advantage of the disadvanged. Wells fargo and so many other companies depend and control our lives solely on information obtained from the credit bureaus. Which most of the time is incorrect and false and not reliable information.
5205,"Wells Fargo did not make a reasonable effort to get in touch with me regarding a delinquent credit card payment, which eventually resulted in a 30 day late. The phone number they had on file was an old and obsolete phone number that should have been updated in XXXX when unnecessary accounts were opened for me. Their collections department contact the old number on file and did not use the alternative phone numbers they had on file to get in touch with me. I believe that Wells Fargo holds equal responsibility in this matter and should recall the 30-day late they reported to the credit bureaus. I have paid this credit card as agreed for 11 years and have not had a single 30 day late. This is not a situation in which I am asking for a favor. This is a situation in which Wells Fargo has equal responsibility for not making a diligent enough effort to contact me. 

I tried to resolve this matter with Wells Fargo 's Customer Advocacy Group, and the representative XXXX lied and contradicted herself multiple times. She told me that she started working my case on XX/XX/XXXX, the day after it was submitted on XX/XX/XXXX. When I followed up regarding this case on XX/XX/XXXX, she told me that she also sent me an email XX/XX/XXXX, which was never sent and is not in either of my inboxes. After a frustrating conversation with her, I felt it was necessary to hang up in order to cool off. I called back about 15 minutes later. During this call, XXXX told me that she had not actually even started working my case yet. On the prior call, however, she kept telling that it was my responsibility to pay the credit bill on time. I find it absolutely shocking and completely unprofessional to treat a consumer the way I was treated. Absolutely unacceptable. I find that XXXX 's lack of investigating this issue and trying to blame the problem on is not keeping this claim impartial and objective, and believe there is a bias against me. Upon stating my concerns and asking for additional information, such as access to XXXX account records, XXXX kept deferring my inquiry to the credit bureaus to resolve. The credit reporting agencies can not assist me with records and retention pertaining to the opening, closing, and maintenance of my checking and savings accounts with Wells Fargo. Upon expressing these concerns to XXXX, she hung up on me."
5206,"Wells fargo account number XXXX. I did purchase 2 gift cards for total of {$1000.00}. They were not given to me by the merchant.

5208,"Contacted Wells Fargo Bank numerous times by phone and in person to notify them that I want them to protect my financial information from being stolen. Requested Wells Fargo to NOT send sensitive credit card applications to my residence address because ID thieves steal the mail and open fraudulent credit accounts. To protect myself from ID theft, I have a more secure mailing address using a post office box at a US post office. Wells Fargo refuses to send sensitive mail ( which can be stolen by ID thieves to perpetrate ID theft and credit card fraud ) to my more secure mailing address. Wells Fargo refuses to protect my financial information."
5210,"I have a visa card with XXXX XXXX XXXX with {$1000.00} credit limit.

I clicked on the link, it was wells fargo, I filled out the application and was accepted on line. I spent XXXX dollars in the card in the first month that I had the card. At the end of the first billing cycle in XXXX I checked my account and there was not a cash back reward, I called wells fargo and they told my it would be given to me in XXXX 2017 at the end of the 90 day intro. period.

I called back on the about the XXXX of XXXX and it still had not been completed, and was told that it was real close to being completed. I then called back on the XXXX of XXXX and was told that it had not been completed yet. I asked to speak to a supervisor who gave me the same answer, and he told me that my case had been taken to the next level of the investigation. ( not sure what that means ) I told them both that this was not their fault, but was not very good customer service. After the lady gave me her reason for the case not being completed. I told her that I was going to file a complaint with the CFPB. and that what they were doing to customers was a bait and switch, At which time I told her was illegal and that I expected to have the XXXX dollars of the reward monies put into my rewards account by the XXXX of XXXX 2017. I  then reiterated that I was going to report them to the CFPB. Thank you for your time in looking into this matter. last four XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, USA ( XXXX )"

I keep getting letters saying we tried to reach you so we closed your case and determined the charges are correct and you are responsible for paying it. I never got communications. i even verified all emails, addresses, and phone numbers. They said they have no record of anyone reaching out. I want this charge taken off because i shouldnt be charged or penalized for fraud that wasnt even me."
5227,"On XX/XX/21, my Wells Fargo Credit Card ending in XXXX had fraudulent charges from XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX. The first charge was for tickets in the amount of {$1700.00}. The second charge was for food vouchers in the amount of {$980.00}. I immediately called Well Fargo to report the charge and they closed my card ending in XXXX and issued a new card. On XX/XX/21 I received a voicemail from Wells Fargo to call them about my card that was closed. I immediately called back the number provided XXXX and spoke with a rep. She looked at my account and stated everything looked good and both charges are removed, account XXXX was closed and I verified I had no unauthorized charges on my new card. I few days later, I see the good voucher amount of {$980.00} posted back onto my new credit card and has a posting date of XX/XX/21 which I believe is incorrect due the the date I spoke with Well Fargo on XX/XX/21 and verified all charges and {$980.00} was not posted. I get a letter from Well Fargo stating they found the charge of {$980.00} to be valid. I have had Wells Fargo re open my case twice, asked for reasons they deemed food vouchers valid yet tickets purchased were identified as fraud. I have not received any paperwork showing their investigation and reasons. I have asked for a supervisor to call me and no return call. I recently opened a City of XXXX Police Report XXXX. I refuse to pay charges that I did not authorize. I feel Wells Fargo investigation department is not properly doing their research when they determine XXXX XXXX tickets were fraudulent, but food vouchers from XXXX XXXX are valid."

5232,"On Friday XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo from a phone number ( work ) in my profile to request a credit line increase. After validating my current / open account with the representative I was sent to underwriting ; were I revalidated my identity, so a credit report could be reviewed. Then I was transferred to the Fraud department and requested to further detail my identity. At this point I was unsure about answering the question "" what year was my house was built '' the agent stated I could call back in and redo the application process ; consequently, having a second credit report pulled. So I ended up guessing on the question, and was wrong, so they locked my account. I was advised I would need to take two pieces of ID into a Wells Fargo branch to validate my identity ; however, there are no Wells branches in Michigan. I was then advised to go to any bank. 
On MondayXX/XX/XXXX I went to my primary checking account institution and explained the ridiculous request to Member Services. I have banked with this institution for more than 20 years and not to my surprise they declined calling the Wells Fargo Fraud department and validating my Credit Card / ID info. I mean why would they, it is not their account. Frustrated I called Wells and filed a customer service complaint as I was investing more time than necessary. I even requested closing the account and was denied until the fraud lock was removed. 
Think about this - I validated my identity with Wells twice for an existing account, which was already established and cleared by the Fraud alert at the time of opening, more than five years ago. So they think some human broke into my office, sat down at my work desk and called My credit card to request a credit line increase. There verify identity with caller ID. 
After Filing the complaint I waited 24 hours without response. So again yesterday I tried 2 more Financial Institutions. XXXX and XXXX and was also both turned away stating this was not something they were comfortable doing. One Banker stated how do we now you did not steal the wallet. 
Even more frustrated I called Wells again on XX/XX/XXXX and requested to speak with a supervisor, I explained to him that I have tried to clear with three banks, tried to close my account, filed a customer complaint and requested an alternate option since they have no local branches in my state."
5236,"I requested a credit amount of {$79.00} to be mailed to me as a Check before closing my Wells Fargo credit card. They claimed that they put on the request at the end of XXXX ( I believe XX/XX/2021 ) and this will take 5 - 15 business days to reach me. Until now, I haven't received anything from them and they keep giving me the runaround whenever I call their customer service."
5237,I am a victim of identity theft. All of my accounts were compromised and my email addresses and phone numbers. My social was compromised as well as my EIN number.I contacted Wella fargo to update information I was not successful in getting assistance with updating my information even though I stated over a recorded line that I was a victim of identity theft I was not assisted in changing my username or password.
5244,I need your help in order to get in touch with my bank and try to solve my problem. I would like my Wells Fargo Business Card to please investigate all charges made by a company called XXXX XXXX. This company failed to provide the services that I paid them for. I paid them {$1000.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and also on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX {$5000.00}. I already tried to dispute with my credit card company but I do not appreciate the way they treated me and disregard my wishes stating that was past 60 days. I never got my services rendered and it is very hard to do anything in the first 60 days when the company you paid for the services is stringing you along. Thank you
5245,"On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo charged a {$50.00} "" REWARDS ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE '' on a credit card which they stated had no annual FEE. The fee was charged to a card that had not even been activated in my business account. If it were not due to my diligent inspection of my account I would have also accumulated interest fees. When I called to report card fraud for transactions made to my account without my permission they refused to allow me to either electronically ( disabled in their system ) or over the phone submit a fraud claim. They were willing to "" provide a credit for the fee '' stating that this was a "" system error '' as if they were doing me a favor. <P/>My primary concern is for other customers who will fall victim to deception intended to result in financial or personal gain by an institution paid for the service of protecting their financial interest."

My credit amount was XXXX and I had 12 months to pay but in XX/XX/XXXX, my balance was still XXXX and the bank is charging me XXXX dollars only in interest. I don't have the money to pay all that, I spoke with the bank to see if They can charge interest only in the amount that I have XXXX because I haven't been working but I still made my payments on time but They want to charge interest on the total amount of XXXX because in the contract I signed it was explained about that."
5252,"I filed credit card disputes with Wells Fargo VISA and XXXX XXXX after I bought an extendable dining table that was defective. XXXX XXXX  dispute investigation determined that XXXX XXXX violated VISAs policies and I was refunded the full amount of the {$1800.00} charge used for the down payment for the table. However, following 2 Wells Fargo VISA dispute investigations, I was told, We are unable to obtain a refund on your behalf because your dispute falls within the merchants pricing and policies, which we have no authority to change. When I asked for clarification, they were unable to give me a satisfactory explanation. So, I filed a complaint with CFPB. The response from Wells Fargo following that investigation was I did not have a 3rd party who works with furniture to verify the table was defective. As a result, I contacted Signature Designer Services the company that delivered and returned the table. I spoke to the owner XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). She recalled the situation immediately. I obtained and attached a letter from her verifying the table was defective.
Signature Design Services delivered the dining table on XXXX/XXXX/2016 and after working for 2 hours their 2 professionals were unable to successfully assemble the extendable dining table. While being extended out, the sections scraped together which would eventually cause damage to the tabletop and they were unable to level the sections of the tabletop so you could safely put a glass down without it being so unstable that it could tip over. The following week, I allowed XXXX to send technicians to my house to attempt to again assembly of the table ( I was not told there was a different technician on vacation or I would have waited for that person ) but after 2 more hours encountered they same problems as previously. I was told my the manager, XXXX, that they would order me a new table.
Feeling uncertain of the quality of the table, the fragile mechanism which extends the table and the fact that I specifically asked the designer for a table I could extend myself ( which Im unable to do with this table as it has to be moved to center it in the room ), I didnt want to reorder another as offered. I called XXXX, the owner of XXXX XXXX to tell her I didnt want the same table replaced. She became defensive, confrontational and argumentative. I felt bullied. She informed me I would have to pay a 30 % restocking fee if I returned the table. I told her I didnt feel I should have to pay a restocking fee for a defective table, this is not typically done.
On XXXX XXXX 2016, XXXX XXXX XXXX came to return the table and were unable to get the table apart, so after 2 hours they turned the table on its side and dragged it out on a blanket.
After the table was returned and the credit card disputes were already filed to get my restocking fee of approx. {$1100.00} back ... weeks later, I received emails ( XX/XX/XXXXto waive extra fees & XX/XX/XXXX to select any other merchandise ) that XXXX was willing to accommodate me and find resolution. By this time, she had destroyed any possible working relationship with her abusive communication and I had already started working with other companies to purchase a table. The merchant gave Wells Fargo many responses that were untrue with the timeline, my responses, phone calls she made to me and conversations that never took place. I worked with the merchant as best I could with what was offered to me at the time it was offered.
As of now, XXXX XXXX has the full amount of {$1800.00} I charged on my Wells Fargo VISA for the remaining balance and they have possession of the dining table.
Although my invoice reads Final sale, I do n't believe this is meant for defective items as receiving a defective item would be a breach of warranty. The invoice does not state return policy of defective items, so I do n't feel I should have to take a store credit that was offered to me weeks after the return.
I am reaching out for your assistance to help me resolve this situation with Wells Fargo VISA."

When I applied for the Wells Fargo Secured Credit Card, neither the Account Agreement nor the Terms and Conditions specified any restrictions on the eligibility for an upgrade to an unsecured WF card. On XX/XX/XXXX, after almost three years with the card and multiple contacts with WF customer service confirming that nothing on the account speaks against an upgrade of the account and asking for more patience, WF still has not upgraded the account. This appears to be due to a clandestine addition of restrictions on upgrade eligibility to the Account Agreement and Terms and Conditions by Wells Fargo without informing customers of these restrictions. Specifically, WF added a clause rendering individuals who are not "" U.S. Citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens '' ineligible for upgrades. 

The attached files are the Wells Fargo Secured Credit Card Account Agreement that WF provided to the CFPB which does not include any language on upgrade eligibility, the current Account Agreement provided on WF 's website as of XX/XX/XXXX which does list such restrictions, the Terms and Conditions at time of application for the account ( XX/XX/XXXX ),  and files that document the timing at which upgrade eligibility criteria where added to the Terms and Conditions ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and to the Account Agreement ( XX/XX/XXXX )."

5263,"To give you the details of what has transpired, please see below : - I lost my typically used credit card through XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, right before I was set to leave on a trip to XXXX XXXX XXXX for work. As such, I used by "" back up '' credit card through Wells Fargo, that my parents helped me open when I was XXXX. <P/>- I paid off the entirety of the Wells Fargo card as soon as I received my XXXX card in XX/XX/XXXX. You can view this in my payment history. <P/>- There was a fraudulent XXXX charge on my account sometime in XX/XX/XXXX for some XXXXUSD. I should mention this is the second time in my short life that Wells Fargo has had fraud issues on my account, the first being some 4-5 years ago. <P/>- There was no notification via email or phone that indicated such a charge had been made, therefore I was not aware and could not process the charge as Fraud. <P/>- The account went into delinquent status because I did not pay the XXXXUSD charge or report it as fraud - again because I was not notified. <P/>- The account was closed because I did not pay the charge or report it - again because I was not notified. <P/>- I found on an application to a new apartment in XXXX XXXX XXXX that something funny was going on with my Wells Fargo account so I called yesterday evening ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I spoke with no less than 5 people - from customer service to fraud to collections to fraud again and was told the following : -- - My account was closed due to lack of payment for over 60 days over a XXXXUSD charge. <P/>-- - There were messages that were sent though none that I received. <P/>-- - There was actually an over-payment on my card from XX/XX/XXXX that led to XXXXUSD balance - the charge was actually paid off prior to happening and there was no payment owed by me. <P/>-- - Fraud was flagged on the account ( by a particularly nasty Wells Fargo employee XXXX ) and she would process as such and let me know the result. <P/>-- - Customer Service mentioned that I would be called by Executive Office to follow up and they would amend my credit report due to "" Bank Error '' and open my account. <P/>- Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I received a call from XXXX regarding this issue. He informed me that to reopen my account, they would need to process a new credit inquiry, etc. After mentioning that my goal was not even to reopen, just to have Wells Fargo rectify their grave error, he told me that was n't possible. I asked him to listen to the recordings of the previous evening figuring that may shed light on what I was trying to achieve. Begrudgingly, he did so. He called me back some 30 minutes later and informed me that the customer service individual I spoke with essentially lied to me, that there was no bank error, and that to reopen my account they would need a credit inquiry. This call lasted another 10 minutes of bickering on behalf of XXXX with no apology and, frankly, a surprising amount of attitude given his position. I mentioned I would like to file another complaint and would like him to confirm the details to which he replied, "" you will need a subpoena for the records. '' As you can see, through multiple errors on behalf of Wells Fargo, I am now writing this letter to you."
5265,"I have gotten back on my feet from a 3 month medical injury. I have faithfully made payments on my Wells Fargo Credit card throughout this time. Unfortunately, because I was unable to work I had to use my credit card from Wells Fargo for other expenses. Now my payments have gone up to XXXX a month which is okay, but last month I could only afford to make a XXXX payment. They are charging me this month XXXX. This XXXX is : XXXX I was remiss last month plus the XXXX I owe and a XXXX late fee. This is ridiculous because they are charging me double interest as a late fee. Can you help me?"
5268,"I used my XXXX card to purchase a large set of shelves online. The shelves arrived defective, I made many attempts directly with the merchant to return the shelves or get a replacement without any progress. I filed dispute # XXXX on XX/XX/2021 with Wells Fargo hoping the merchant would respond. The merchant did not respond to Wells Fargo for return or replacement info concerning my purchase. I have made many calls to my CC Wells Fargo to ask status on the dispute and all they do is followup. 

Per the terms of my credit card the merchant has 45 days to respond to a claim, as of today it is now 55 days and Wells Fargo has not received any info from the merchant. At 45 days after my claim, on XX/XX/2021, the claim should have closed and credit permanently issued to my account. My claim is being mishandled by Wells Fargo. 

See attached to confirm all info above."
5271,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I was charged {$510.00} and {$640.00} to my credit card account through Wells Fargo to XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX. I did not have my card in my possession and did not authorize anyone to use my card. These referenced charges are fraud. I have never made any purchases at XXXX XXXX. Wells Fargo denied my claim two times with the explanation that it was used by chip. Wells Fargo did not answer my questions about the signature of these purchases. I did not sign or ever enter this mall. At the time of the fraudulent charges, I was in the XXXX XXXX area on a hike. I am in my 3rd round of disputing these charges and have filed a police report in XXXX XXXX."
5273,"In XXXX I received a solicitation call from Wells Fargo wanting me to obtain a credit card account. I told the solicitor I would not agree to any terms over the phone, but if they sent me the terms in writing I would review them, and decide if I wanted to open a credit account with them. A few days after the phone call solicitation I received a Wells Fargo credit card in the mail. Due to my naivety at the time I activated the card and began to use it. Later I learned that the account was most likely fraudulently opened, but because I had a sizable balance I was paying off and did not want to go through the hassle of closing the account or deal with possible XXXX XXXX implications I kept the account. 

Finally, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, due to the unfavorable terms of the credit agreement I decided to go through the process of closing the account. I went to Wells Fargo in XXXX, NJ, and told a personal banker about the unauthorized opening of the credit account. The banker had me talk on the phone to XXXX separate individuals. XXXX individual offered to allow me XXXX months without interest to pay off the balance, but those terms did not seem reasonable because Wells Fargo has already made a lot of money off interest fees from my account and I do n't think they should be making any more. Finally I talked to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who told me the credit account was applied for through the mail. I have never applied for a credit card through the mail. She told me she would investigate, but I have n't heard back from her, and Wells Fargo keeps on charging me interest on my credit account payments."
5275,"We were notified by email from Wells Fargo Bank that our address had been changed per a USPS change of address request. We called them to say we did not change our address and that it should be changed back immediately. In the interim, an attempt was made to add our Wells Fargo credit card to  an unknown XXXX user 's device ; fortunately, that charge did not go through. We asked Wells Fargo why they would change our address without our authorization and they said that they rely on USPS change of address requests to do so. We complained about this and they agreed to elevate our concerns to their "" Executive '' department ; we received a letter basically reiterating their practice of such updates and apologizing "" for any inconvenience. '' We contacted USPS and there is no record of any change of address being made - their fraud department is running its own investigation. The question is how could Wells Fargo make a change with no change of address existing? We have written them another letter asking them the same question but doubt it will elicit any different response. We are forwarding our concerns to you as we question this practice - in today 's age of identity theft, it seems like a very unsafe thing to do for a banking institution meant to safeguard our monies."
5276,"When my credit was pulled on     XXXX   XXXX  2017    to purchase a new home for my family, there were  2  late payment stated on my   XXXX   credit report for  Wells Fargo Financial. T hey showed that the payments were late in both  XXXX  and  XXXX   2017 . The only late payment was in  XXXX   2017 , because I was not able to pay full amount due because I had paid my last fine payment, I can understand that. But it also showed the payment for  XXXX   2017  was also late. In  XXXX   2017 , I made  two payments, 1st one  was  on  XX/XX/XXXX  and 2nd was on  XX/XX/XXXX . the total of the two  were for the amount due of {$410.00}. I also have proof from   XX/XX/XXXX   statement that they received those payments, yet falsely reported late payment for  XX/XX/XXXX .   Being a   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  Veteran that my only income is my   XXXX   XXXX   and  XXXX .   This also effects my military security clearance, which I will have for the rest of my life."
5278,"This is XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is submitting this CFPB complaint myself, and to inform you that there is no third party involved in the process. This item is reporting late as reported in my 3 Credit Bureaus. Lets correct this immediately. The Bureaus are required to verify for themselves, but they failed to neither verify nor update me about these complaints. 
WELLS FARGO BANK XXXX Opened XX/XX/2011 Balance {$0.00} Late Closed-"
5279,"I have had the XXXX XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX and have always paid on time. 

I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and have gone over my limit and they will not increase or process payments quickly. I have called every day this week several times to no avail and I have now cancelled this. I even went and made a XXXX savings and checking account because I would have access to XXXX $ credit, that is not true now because Im over my limit. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX  says its an unlimited card but it is not, and requires you do submit taxes and forms and then the system crashes. 

But the worst one of all is Wells Fargo. They mark you down for fraud, and the fraud department doesnt work on weekends and when they are open during working hours, the lines are busy. I am going to file a formal lawsuit because I was involved in a car crash from the stress and lack of sleep caused by these banks. FDIC should be open 24/7.

Also, hotels can not charge an incidental extra charge. It needs to all be included in the price. How a room goes from {$500.00} to {$850.00} is beyond me. And how my XXXX XXXX room doubled in price at check out is ludicrous."
5285,In XXXX I was charged the full balance of my credit card ( I never agreed to those terms ) and that upended my checking account. I received a refund and have made all payments on time since then. The account has been paid off multiple times. Last month I was shocked to see that I had far exceeded my credit card limit and called to find out what the problem was. I was told the charges on my credit card were repayment for XXXX of this year when I had believed that to be settled and finalized.
5288,"Starting in XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo started sending me statements in the mail for a credit card I had paid off and closed on XX/XX/XXXX. These statements showed a credit limit of {$4300.00} but I had no credit card nor any access to this account. The statement showed I owed them over {$2000.00}. And without my permission they began taking the amount of {$46.00} per month out of my checking account at a different bank. When I called them about this they gave me information to access my old credit card account online but I was unable to access this account online. I called several times to explain this account was paid off and closed and to stop but Wells Fargo never complied with my requests. I continued to let them remove the payments from my account so my credit score would not be affected.

In XX/XX/XXXX I changed banks and now Wells Fargo is demanding payment for an account that was paid off on XX/XX/XXXX and showing me as late on my credit report. What they are doing is fraud. On my credit report it shows this credit card account was opened onXX/XX/XXXX and closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I have written a letter to Wells Fargo with a copy of the credit report and letting them know I have contacted the Consumer Finance as well."
5291,"As of XX/XX/XXXX I had a balance of {$4600.00} on my Wells Fargo credit card. The whole of this balance was from a balance-transfer offer and was financed at 0 % apr until XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a purchase for {$270.00} using the card. This purchase was subject to a 16.99 % purchase apr. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of {$320.00} and on XX/XX/XXXX I made another payment of {$1900.00}. These payments were well in excess of the {$48.00} minimum payment for my XXXX statement cycle, yet neither was applied to the purchase balance that was accruing interest, as they should have been under US federal law and CFPB rules. According to Wells Fargo, as of XX/XX/XXXX, I still have a XXXX purchase balance accruing interest at 16.99 % and I have been improperly charged a total of {$6.00} in interest for this purchase."
5293,"XX/XX/XXXX, To whom this may concern, I was just informed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) is the agency where my complaint against Wells Fargo Bank needs to be. I have already summitted my complaint to the State of Californias Department of Financial Protection and Innovation ( DFPI ), which I was then referred to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ), which I was then referred to the ( CFPB ). I have provided my affidavit along with supporting documents that pertains to this matter. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo inquiring about additional Covid-19 help/assistance. I outlined and explained my situation transparently and in good faith, as I was anticipating issues of continued monetary aid, because it was impossible to get in contact with the State of Californias Unemployment Department ( EDD ). I explained that my only income i.e., unemployment assistance may be running out along with the Federal extensions. I was told to call back when I was not able to make payment. During that phone call, on a recorded line nothing was ever mentioned that Wells Fargo no longer offers payment deferments that was made available during XXXX, as that program ended XX/XX/XXXX, which I was just recently made aware of. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I was issued my last unemployment payment and Federal extension, see ( EXHIBIT, 1 ). The State of California unemployment system is a complete disaster. My benefits were cut off with no explanation, what so ever. I have made many attempts to contact ( EDD ), via phone and by email, to no avail to get a better understanding as to why? 
XX/XX/XXXX, I reached back out to Wells Fargo, as I was directed to in order to see what my options were regarding any Covid-19 resources and/or support. I was passed around from CSR to CSR on a recorded line explaining over and over my situation, finally I was transferred to a department that I thought was for Covid-19 assistance, it was not. I ended up in the collections department. I re-verified my account again. Immediately, I was asked if I can make the payment that was due which at that time I could not, I was in shock, as I was under the impression Wells Fargo was here to help in these unprecedented times. I told the collections agent that I was going to reach out to the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and the State of Californias Department of Financial Protection and Innovation ( DFPI ) and apparently my hot word comments triggered the collections agent to escalate this matter. XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email regarding the above, see ( EXHIBIT, 2 ) I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, from XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX generated by XXXX XXXX, see ( EXHIBIT, 3A, 3B ). XX/XX/XXXX, I was deemed XXXX by my XXXX XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to XXXX, I left a voicemail. Following day, XX/XX/XXXX, I made contact with XXXX. I outlined and summarized my situation on a recorded line again. I was told that Wells Fargo no longer offers any Covid-19 assistance as they did back in XXXX. I asked why didnt the CSR tell me that when I spoke to them back in XX/XX/XXXX, no answer, however I was offered to be transferred to the payment plan department , I declined, because I have no source of income, which is needed in order to be part of that program. It would have been a complete waste of time for both parties. I told her I wanted to escalate this matter to her immediate Supervisor. Same day, I received an email referencing the above phone conversation, see ( EXHIBIT, 4 ). 
I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, from XXXX XXXX, with the Research and Remediation Analyst Executive Office, see ( EXHIBIT, 5A, 5B ). It states the same remedy and provided a Service Apology which is in my view is Wells Fargos indirect way of saying pay up regardless of your situation and that is highly unacceptable. In addition to that, it states Previous case We have confirmed a resolution was provided for previous case number XXXX ; in addition, we have attached a copy of the resolution for your review, there was no attached letter of resolution. I respectfully request that Wells Fargo provide that for my records. XX/XX/XXXX, a voice mail was left for me by XXXX from Wells Fargos Executive office. XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX back and left a voice mail at XXXX, no response. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I called back to follow up with XXXX, I entered her extension number XXXX, it was answered by XXXX on a recorded line. I outlined again my situation with him. He said there was no case notes or even knew who XXXX was? I was beyond aggravated and very agitated. I told XXXX to make a note to have somebody from the Executive office call me after XXXX ( PST ) same day, as I had prior engagements before then. I never received a call that day whatsoever. Same day, XX/XX/XXXX, I was instructed to resubmit a new claim for unemployment per the direction of ( EDD ), also at that time I filed for XXXX assistance, see ( EXHIBIT, 6A, 6B ). XX/XX/XXXX, I was notified by ( EDD ) that a request for an extension has been submitted, see ( EXHIBIT, 7 ), that was prompted by my email to ( EDD ) XX/XX/XXXX, requesting feedback about my cut off payments, see ( EXHIBIT, 8 ). 
XX/XX/XXXX, I reached back out to XXXX, because I had not received a return call that I set up with XXXX, as mentioned above. At that time XXXX mentioned that my case was closed. She informed me that a call was made that I requested XX/XX/XXXX, to the only number on my file XXXX, that call never took place, something is not adding up. I became very agitated and was not at all happy in regards to how Wells Fargo was handling this matter, so I requested to escalate this to her immediate supervisor. I was given XXXX XXXX name and XXXX. I was told either one of them would be contacting me within 24 to 48 hours. If I had not followed up with this matter it would still be sitting dormant, as I have not received any notifications via mail, email or via phone to date regarding a case closure. 
XX/XX/XXXX, I missed a call from XXXX, she left a voicemail prompting me to call back for further assistance. I was unable to take the call, as I was without my notes to discuss this matter. XX/XX/XXXX, I returned her call, I spoke with intake CSR XXXX on a recorded line and gave her specific instructions for XXXX to call me after XXXX ( MST ). It is obvious to me that XXXX did not look at the notes in the case. I missed her call, as she called me at XXXX ( MST ). It is beyond me, as to why Wells Fargo can not follow through with simple instructions to contact me at a specific time to remedy this matter. This was the second time I specifically dedicated a time for a call back and Wells Fargo failed miserably. I had to call back again, I spoke with another CSR and again reverified my account, as XXXX was in a meeting at that time. 
I was told that XXXX would call back in 30 minutes, she did. I outlined my situation again on a recorded line, only to be given the same answers that XXXX and XXXX had offered me, however I brought to her attention the information I found online that clearly states Helping you during these uncertain times, see ( EXHIBIT, 9 ). I do not see that being the case in this matter. I also found online regarding Loan and line of credit relief that Wells Fargo was offering on a case-by-case basis and other resources, see ( EXHIBITS, 10A, 10B, 10C, 10D ). Exhibit, 10A, was printed on XX/XX/XXXX and Exhibits 10B, 10C, 10D, was printed on XX/XX/XXXX. This is 8 months after the deferment program had ended XX/XX/XXXX. That tells me that there is help/assistance available, but it appears its at Wells Fargos discretion which is no help to consumers like me in this particular situation. ( EXHIBIT, 11A, 11B ) are screen shots of my Wells Fargo app sign on page, it clearly states assistance, resources ( plural ) and support are available. Also, Wells Fargos on hold recording provides the same information. I find this to be very misleading and unethical, because it gives consumers a sense of hope that there are various outlets for help, when in fact there is only one resource for help which is a payment plan, something is not adding up. 
I was denied any other assistance, as I was again referred to the only resource for assistance, which is a payment plan, which in order to be part of that program you have to have verified income. I again outlined my financial situation and it appears to me it fell on deaf ears again. XXXX was no help whatsoever. During that conversation, I take full accountability for using vulgar language, due to this matter exacerbating/triggering my documented ( XXXX ) XXXX condition and I sincerely apologize about that. 
Wells Fargo is on the threshold of a Law suit for mental anguish due to this matter, which I did inform XXXX. I feel that there are other alternatives that could be exercised, but Wells Fargo refuses to go there. I have made all my past payments on time and have been very forth coming and transparent regarding this matter from the beginning. I have been struggling and fighting to save my outstanding credit report for over the past year due to circumstances to no fault of mine and Wells Fargo refuses to recognize that. I am on the threshold of losing my outstanding credit rating and another vehicle, if I do not get any approved income from the State of California. 
I have no other alternative, but to get the ( DFPI ) and ( BBB ) involved to expose how this banking institution handles these matters. I have taken two other banking institutions to these authorities i.e. ; XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX within the last year and was very successful by showing a pattern of unethical business practices. I hope that Wells Fargo can see the bigger picture in order to remedy my situation. 
Finally, in my view the world paused completely on the onset of Covid-19, which created a bottle neck of issues later down the road for situations like this to no fault to the consumer. It is not fair to consumers to be treated like this to be bullied and forced into situations like this. In addition, today XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Wells Fargo, asking me to update my income, in order to potentially increase my credit limit. Wells Fargo had the audacity to send this out to me and I feel very confident to millions of other consumers. I find that appalling and extremely unacceptable. That program in my view is designed to bury the consumer even more, see ( EXHIBIT, 12A, 12B, 12C, 12D, 12E, 12F ) Wells Fargo has a tarnished past and this pattern of behavior is just another black eye for Wells Fargo. I can assure Wells Fargo I will be taking this matter to the media along with all the other unscrupulous businesses to expose what I have been dealing with for over the past year regardless of outcome, it all has been very well documented with all the outcomes in my favor. The ( DFPI ) has already provided me contacts for Attorneys at Law for this type of situation from my previous claim with XXXX XXXX. I will be heard and counted. 
CONCLUSION I respectfully request the ( DFPI ) to investigate this matter in its entirety to remedy this matter. The remedy I am seeking is full relief of my outstanding debt due to the extreme levels of emotional anguish. Wells Fargos adverse actions has caused me extreme adverse effects mentally. This remedy would be in lieu of a class action Lawsuit. I strongly feel I am not the only consumer that is faced with this situation. 
Respectfully, XXXX XXXX XXXX"

I ask them if I close my card would they send me my {$7.00} and they told me if I close the card I forfeit my earned rewards.

The merchant explained if I did not have my card that they could not process the refund and I should just go through the bank to process my refund. I went to Wellsfargo bank and they advised me that I should go to the Merchant to process my refund because the merchant did offer the refund and there is nothing Wellsfargo can do.

Within XXXX weeks, they charged me back for those transactions and told me that the chip was used on the card. I know that I did not use the card for those purchases. In fact, one of the businesses called "" XXXX XXXX '' is not a "" real '' business. They have no store front and I ca n't find them on the web.

They told me that process takes 30 days and we conducted that "" process '' during the time period of XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX and the merchants did not respond to Wells Fargo attempts. After that 30 day process, Wells Fargo told me that I could enter into an arbitration period.

5304,"I am disputing a current charge of {$6700.00} ( originally {$7200.00} ) to my Platinum card ( ending in XXXX ) account. The charge is in error because I did not authorize this transaction, which consisted of a {$7200.00} cash advance. Associated fees ( interest fee and cash advance fee ) have since been resolved and a credit of {$420.00} was debited to the account, however a balance of {$6700.00} remains. I received a notice of statement via email on XX/XX/XXXX, which reflects the erroneous charge. I did not authorize this transaction and did not give my authorization to anyone to perform this transaction on my behalf. A fraudster had gained access to my online account and initiated the XXXX XXXX of {$7200.00} from the XXXX XXXX to my Checking Account. From the Checking Account, the fraudster then sent the {$7200.00} + {$1900.00} from my checking account ( Total of {$9100.00} ) via a wire transfer to a bank that I do not have an account with and that I have no association with. 

I am requesting that the error be corrected, that any finance or other charges related to the disputed amount be credited to my account, and that I get an accurate statement. 

Per the Fair Credit Billing Act, Wells Fargo has up to 2 billing cycles to conduct your investigation and was not allowed by federal law to charge me a payment during the course of this investigation. During this time, Wells Fargo was not allowed to try to collect the payment, charge interest on it, or report it to credit bureaus as late. However, this practice was not exercised during the investigation, which is reflected on the electronic statement ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) attached. An amount of {$7600.00} was still an active charge, which caused my account to be over limit ( credit card limit is {$7500.00} ). This resulted in the account being reported to the Credit Bureaus as Over Credit Limit ( as reflected by the XXXX Alert attached ) and a 37 point decrease in my credit score. As of now, the fees have been resolved- however, a balance of {$6700.00} still reflects on this account, despite the report and confirmation by multiple Wells Fargo representatives that this transaction was "" clearly fraud '' and "" indeed fraud '', which I "" shouldn't have to pay because it is not your fault ''. A Minimum Payment of {$68.00} is due on XX/XX/XXXX. I have reported to Wells Fargo multiple times that this balance is fraud. The Fair Credit Billing Act dictates that I have 60 days to dispute a credit card charge. I have made multiple phone claims and filed several complaints through CFPB, as well as XXXX I have mailed a letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX, which is within the 60 day time frame from when the statement containing the erroneous charge was made available online ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Furthermore, because I have reported the fraud within this 60 day timeframe and it is greater than {$50.00}, Wells Fargo is restricted by federal law from collecting payment, charging interest on the fraudulent balance, reporting this balance to the credit bureaus as late. If any of these things occur, I will be serving Wells Fargo with legal notice in accordance with the rights provided to me by the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) and Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) via my attorney. 

Enclosed are copies of the email dated XX/XX/XXXX that notified me of available electronic account statement, the statement dated XX/XX/XXXX that reflects the erroneous charge and XXXX Credit Notification of decrease in score and Over Limit Account notice, supporting my position and claims. Please correct the error on my account promptly. 

I have mailed a copy of this letter via certified mail to Wells Fargo ( dated XX/XX/XXXX )"
5305,"I was shocked when I reviewed my credit report and found late payment on the dates below : 30 days past due  XXXX  I am not sure how this happened, I believe that I had made my payments to you when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me."
5308,"I paid for an appraisal for a home via Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo picked the appraiser, which was okay at the time. 
After 6 weeks I had yet to receive my appraisal and made a big fuss about it. A week or 2 later, an incomplete appraisal was delivered to me. It is missing the appraised value of the house and I reached out to the mortgage team who kept telling me some repairs have to be done. I kindly advised that repairs or not, the appraisal should show the value of the home at that point. 
Up until today, a completed appraisal has not been given to me. 
I have attached the appraisal I was sent and you will see the value of the surrounding homes are present. The value for my appraised property is fuzzed out."
5309,"Wells Fargo issues me a credit card with a {$6300.00} credit limit that was never applied for. I have contacted them and opened an executive complaint ( XXXX ) and they admit they have no application for the account, but refuse to close it."
5311,"I applied for a Wells Fargo 0 % transfer card online on XX/XX/2021. I was instantly approved and they requested my transfer account numbers which I did not have hardly. They sent an email stating I could pick up the application later and continue. I came back 5 days later and finished the app and they said it was delayed. 

I called and they said they upon further review they changed their mind and I was denied. But they did not send me a denial communication. 

If they had I would have had time to apply for a different card before this one dinged my credit. 

This is wrong. It's probably allowed because the system protects banks over people but it is wrong."
5312,Credit cards/store cards were opened in my name and birth date with a social security number that is not mine. These accounts have been reported to  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  in which are harming my credit. I have disputed these account 8 times and  XXXX  a long with these companies have yet to do the right thing and remove these fraudulent accounts off my credit file.

When I tried to use the cards I was told there was no value in the balance. I went to Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX and asked them why the confiscated my cards. They made a call to XXXX who stated they had "" Unloaded Value to Customer Service Application '' what ever that is. On the first card # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX they claimed they had mailed a check. I told them I received no check, to which they stated I cashed it. I requested proof but XXXX declined.

However the expiration date on card # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is XX/XX/XXXX and the expiration date on card # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is XX/XX/XXXX"
5321,"I notified Wells Fargo credit card services for 2.5 years regarding the numerous repetitive erroneous, false charges appearing on my credit card statements, for items never purchased, nor were ever delivered, and several times while reporting the fraudulent charges, I requested my card number to be changed. Instead, they increased my credit limit on the already-compromised account, still being fraudulently charged, of which they didnt investigate, make the then-XXXX  acct number unusable to combat falsely-charged items, nor did they ever remove the false charges after my numerous requests to get them to remove the false charges, change the card number or turn the card off as it continued to be falsely charged with the newly inflated credit limit. They can certainly, and should verify with delivery services ( like XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc. ) that the merchandise they were charging me for was never delivered to me. I spent an enormous amount of time trying to get them to be accountable, and for them to not hold me responsible for falsely-charged, reported falsely charged items, of which I would certainly not charge up on a credit card, which was eventually maxed-out with continued fraudulent charging upon the new, inflated credit limit. This should not reflect poorly or as negative on my credit report, as they were notified of the false charges in a timely manner ( XXXX ), all actual truthful charges I paid off, and the numerous hours Ive spent in sending letters and via phone calls should have been enough to warrant them verifying that I never received the products/merchandise, and for them to remove these charges from my account, I shouldnt be responsible for the reported fraudulent use of my account-credit card number after my notifying them, ( XXXX was my acct # then ), that these charges were bogus, I shouldnt have to pay for false charging on my account, I believe that they should be responsible to me for verifying these items, non-ordered/non-delivered, are removed from my account charges and corrections should be made to reflect truth. I especially should not have this account reflect negatively against me on my credit report, considering the extraordinary amount of time and energy I have had to spend in order to attempt to have these false charges against me corrected for truth, and to have the fraud removed off my account."

Today ( XX/XX/21 ) I signed on to the online portal and to my dismay I saw an available line of credit of ~ {$270.00} which tranlated to me owing {$4700.00}. 

I immediately called the Wells Fargo Customer support line as the math didnt make sense as the transactions including pending transactions didnt total the balance shown. Upon being transferred to the XXXXCustomer Advocacy ' team I was informed that they had a 'glitch ' which applied a duplicate payment to my account and they 'fixed "" the glitch. I proceeded to inform the agent that this was completely unacceptable as I had received no communication or advance warning of any these issues and she proceeded to search for a communication or bulletin. After about XXXX minutes of putting me on hold she was unable to refer to any artifacts sent to me notifying of the event and the redaction they applied to my account.

They told me to put down my previous income ( I was unemployed ) and the loan officer said "" Because your probably going to find a job soon ''. My debt continued to get worse and worse and then they gave my son a credit card saying I could use that too. All together I think I had 6 Wells  Fargo bank accounts and three credit cards. When my debt finally got to be more than I could handle, I could no longer pay. Then Wells Fargo sued me in court. I could n't afford an attorney so I attempted to represent myself.

5347,"Well Fargo Active Cash credit card, the way it calculate and charges interest, is that if you don't pay the last statement balance in full, you will be charged interest on the whole balance not on the unpaid balance. So for example, if my statement balance is XXXX $ and I make a payment of XXXX $ by my due date, I still will be charged interest on the whole XXXX XXXX not the XXXX $ unpaid balance. This is unfair, and mostly disadvantaging underprivileged customers living paycheck to paycheck. 
More importantly, the way interest is calculated is not described in the terms and conditions agreement provided once signing up for the credit card. Therefore, this is an unfair charge which is also not disclosed properly."

Not long after I fell back on payments since I did not have a stable job at the time and I was making only the minimum payment. At a certain point the card maxed out due to fees and high rates. At that point, Wells Fargo instead of reaching out to me, the credit card department increased my card limit from {$500.00} to {$1100.00} as a solution when the card was maxed out due to fees not overspending. it created additional financial distress for me when the card should have been closed out or they just have tried to reach an agreement with me.

Both payments were made electronically. How is that possible that one of the largest bank in the US is not capable of knowing whether they got funds thru an ACH??? Our account information is a private matter. Wells Fargo has no need to request it since ACH was used. It is not the only card we have, but it is first time we are having that kind of problem.

In XXXX of XXXX my payment was admittedly late. I called and spoke with a Wells Fargo representative named XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, who said that this fee would be reversed. ( {$29.00} ) She told me said fee would be reversed by XX/XX/XXXX. I called, again, in late XXXX as the fee wasn't reversed from my statement. This time I spoke with XXXX. She assured me that this would be reversed. It was reversed on XX/XX/XXXX. 
However, my payments made electronically through my bank, are taken from my account immediately and sent to Wells Fargo within 24-48 hours. This information was provided to me directly through XXXX XXXX XXXX  this morning, during a conversation with XXXX. XXXX attempted to do a conference call with a representative of Wells Fargo, this morning ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) and the representative said that she was unable to do so, as it was a recorded line. (?! ) I spoke with her, and her explanation made no sense so I requested to speak with a supervisor. 
Storm came on the line. I have no idea why this young man is in customer service. He was rude and condenscending. He told me that the original {$29.00} late fee was credited to my balance but because the payment amount that I have been paying monthly ( since the inception of the loan ) didn't match the statement that my late fees, with interest are now {$110.00}. 
This still makes no sense to me, as after my conversation with my bank I think that it's crazy that Wells Fargo is not crediting these funds to my account in a timely manner. Once I hit the submit payment button, the funds are no longer available to me, in my account. 
I took the time to make copies of all of my statements and bill pay receipts as well as the statement from my bank and mailed this all to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX. I have not yet received a response. 
I am not sure that you will be able to help me but I am so clost to paying off this account in full and I am terrified at what additional fees they will slap on the account before I am able to do so. 
Thanking you in advance for any assistance that you may be able to provide.

5387,In late XXXX I received a Wells Fargo credit card in my name that I did not apply for. I called the same day using the numbers listed on the cover page. The representative I spoke with said she needed my SSN which I did not feel comfortable giving her so I did give her the credit card number and my name. She said there was nothing found in the system for that card. I then asked her about it being a fraudulent card and she said she would send me a fraud application which I never received. Weeks later on XX/XX/XXXX I received another piece of mail about having a Wells Fargo Everyday Checking account that I did not apply for. It said there ( luckily ) was a XXXX balance but that there would be fees for a XXXX balance. Please help me with this fraudulent account. It needs addressed and closed

The customer service rep advised that there was a bug in online banking and it was crediting online transfers from my checking accounts to my credit card multiple times in error. She believed the bug had been fixed and the corrections had all posted. 

Later that day more corrections began appearing some with transaction dates going back six weeks before the posting date. For example a "" BANK ADJUSTMENT '' of {$87.00} posted on XXXX with a transaction date of XXXX."

I did what I believe to be the correct thing in reporting these charges as fraud as I did not authorize them, nor have possession of my card at the time of noticing the charges. I received in the mail a letter that Wells Fargo deemed these charges as not fraudulent and was re-billed."
5394,"There were several charges on my Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX credit card that I did not initiate or authorize. I reported the charges to the bank as soon as I discovered them. Wells Fargo sent e a new card, and initiated an investigation. An investigator called me after I received the new card. The investigator asked if I was in possession of the card. I misunderstood the question. I thought the investigator was talking about the new card they sent so I answered yes. Because of this Wells Fargo denied my claim.

I have submitted documentation including a police report, supporting my claim. The charges were made on two consecutive days. Some an hour from my home, and two others more than 6 hours away. Wells Fargo continues to claim the charges appear to be authorized by me, but provide no further explanation as to why they believe I authorized these charges. The card was lost or stolen, and I was not in possession of the card when the charges were made."

I called the number, and it was an exact match o f the Wells Fargo call in line. Same automated service, same hold music and I was greeted the same way I am greeted when I typically call Wells Fargo. I was asked for my name, SSN, and then my account user ID. I gave my name and SSN, but when he asked for my user ID, I became suspicious that I was not actually speaking with Wells Fargo so I told him that I did not remember. After questioning me why I did n't remember, he eventually said that he was going to escalate this to his manager. When she came on the line she asked for my name again, and the last 4 digits of my SSN, which I gave. She then said that my account was on hold, told me there had been a large charge recently on my account, and asked if I could tell her any of the recent amounts. I told her I did n't know, because I rarely use the card. She told me the most recent total and airline it was booked with, then asked if I had booked the trip. I told her no, she said she would deny the charge, and asked me if I would like to take my account off hold. I said absolutely not, and said I wanted the card canceled. She said that all  she could do was keep it on hold, so asked if there was anything else she could do for me. I told her no as I realized what information it was that I just gave to someone I knew was a scammer. I asked for her name, and she mumbled out a generic sound. I asked her a couple more times and she finally settled on  XXXX .   
I got off the phone and immediately got my Wells Fargo card and called the number on the back. The Wells Fargo associate I spoke with got into my account and immediately let me kn  ow that there had been  XXXX  charges that were flagged, and proceeded to confirm which charges were mine. He then closed the account, let me know where to send the e-mail s  o Wells Fargo can follow up, and set up a new account for me.
The questions the Wells Fargo associate asked was exactly the same as I got from the scammers, which led me to believe that they were recording my answers, and planned to call Wells Fargo and play my answers in order to get the charges approved.
I have since updated all my passwords, put a 90 day freeze on my credit, and called all the financial institutions I work with to set up 2 part verification."
5400,"I called Wells Fargo last night around XXXX Monday XX/XX/XXXX. This was in reference to the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX and its {$45.00} annual fee and also misrepresentation on the phone about currency conversion and foreign transaction fees. Wells Fargo has 2 XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) the woman ( XXXX ) I spoke to told me that as of recent the XXXX and XXXX cards terms have been made the same but, I think inquired why does the {$45.00} annual fee remain. She had no answer to me in regards to that and then offered me to switch my card to the original XXXX. I told her would n't that affect my credit, she said she did n't know and could not make a representation, I was then forward to the credit department in Wells Fargo, who still could n't give me an answer. I spoke the credit bureau this morning in regards to my credit score implications and she indicated if I had to close down one account and switch it over it would affect my credit score. Without informing older customers of the XXXX, all these customers are being required to pay {$45.00} a year for something that is free on the XXXX. And to correct it this would cost us a ding on our credit, which is absurd. Additionally, several Wells Fargo employees indicated to me that foreign transaction fees and currency conversion fees were the same thing. But after reading up on this, that is not true and the company was making false statements."

I called Wells Fargo today and found out that a credit card had been issued by Wells Fargo for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in my name on XX/XX/2022. There is already a balance of over {$2400.00}. I did not take out this credit card nor have I ever purchased any products from this company which I was informed was in Wisconsin. They also told be that this credit card was applied for on line. 
I do not want this to ruin my credit and be reported for being delinquent while this is being resolved. Also Wells Fargo said it may take up to 90 days to research this. Really! 90 days? In my opinion Wells Fargo is very sloppy in their business practices."
5409,"Upon contacting fraud department ( by phone ) on XX/XX/XXXX for the third time regarding status on claim filed on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by Wells Fargo representative that my claim was denied per investigator 's report/notes. According to WF, their investigator had called the vendor, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and apparently was told by vendor that I authorized these charges over the phone. I feuded with this WF rep for about 15 minutes that I absolutely did not make such charges nor did I authorize same. He could not, or would not, help in any manner except suggest that I submit a "" Reconsideration '' request letter either by mail or fax. I completed the letter and sent to WF via fax later that day on XX/XX/XXXX My complaint is that now I 'm being held liable for these charges even though WF advertises that customers are protected from unauthorized charges on Visa credit cards. Additionally, It seemed as though they simply took the vendor at his word without so much as obtaining any proof. Where is this protection and why is the burden placed on consumer to resolve? Please review summary of events noted below and advise : On XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by a credit card service/machine operator that processes credit card transactions for vendor ( I did not get a name, but it I confirmed with this male he was not with Wells Fargo ) warning me that unusual activity/charges were being charged against my card and that I needed to contact Wells Fargo in order to submit a fraud claim. He aIso confirmed that credit card info was "" keyed in '' and not presented at time of transaction. I then went onto my online account and noticed that over {$12000.00} in charges had been made over 6 to 8 transactions to the same vendor ranging from {$1100.00} to {$4400.00} each beginning on XX/XX/XXXX. So I called the number listed on my WF online transaction report for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Upon inquiring with vendor about these charges, I explained that it was not me that made such charges and had him read back the info that was given for processing credit card. He appeared to be very cooperative on the phone and went on to tell me that a man calling himself, XXXX XXXX with phone number ( XXXX ) XXXX, had called in using my card and confirmed that he used all my billing information ( card number, expiration date, security code ) except he used an old zip code ( from a previous address that was nearly a year old ). After completing the phone call, I called Wells Fargo and initiated the fraud claim where I explained, in detail, what transpired on the phone with this vendor. I offered to provide the name and phone number referenced above but I was assured the investigator would call the same vendor I talked with earlier and obtain the same information. Now, after following up for a third time with WF and demanding to talk to a supervisor, another rep ( presumably a supervisor ) from explained that the charges were processed and allowed to post to account because his notes had indicated that WF investigator concluded that it was ME that gave billing info to vendor. Again, I argued that it was not me and expressed my frustration on how such an investigation could take place where they take the vendor 's word for it, even with the knowledge that an old zip code was used to key in the transaction! I was very clear that I have NEVER conducted business with this vendor and certainly have not received any goods or services from same. To add insult to injury, Wells Fargo reported the high balance to credit bureaus resulting in a slight score decrease. I also told the rep that it was very inconvenient that I had to write a letter in lieu of dealing with a banker and/or fraud investigator. Not to mention that the timeframe necessary to take care of all these mismanaged facts in this case were disruptive and will take an exceedingly long time to resolve ( 30 to 45 days according to WF rep ). <P/>I should not be responsible for these charges and WF has not been diligent in representing and/or protecting my account. I 've been a customer with WF since XX/XX/XXXX and have used credit card for nearly {$500000.00} in charges over the years. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. I look forward to your response."

When I called to ask what happened, I did not receive any information. All they would tell me is that it was closed. I demanded to know why. Not until   XXXX   did someone tell me that in  XXXX . when I made the {$320.00} payment, According to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A they claimed that I should have made a {$370.00} payment.

When I was told in  XXXX  about why they closed my account, I was then informed that my account would be charged off. My question to them was : "" Why was I receiving a new credit card after this account was closed? '' as it did not make any sense to me. Wells Fargo has been sued by the CFPB just last month as it appears that over 68,000 consumers were defrauded in this very same manner by closing my account and then destroying my credit score, and opening another another account, without my permission. ( at a much higher interest rate and including unfavorable terms to me, the consumer. ) They are unwilling to admit that they are complacent in this credit card Fraud scheme, all of which is in violation of the federal law refered to as the Fair Debt Collection and Practices Act."

In XX/XX/XXXX Fraud department contacted me via automated text message about a fraudlent charge. The charge was declined properly. I called them within a few hours and requested again that they close my account as I have not been a Wells Fargo member for many years. 

This is unacceptable as it was about 7-8 years since I was no longer a member of Wells Fargo and not a cardholder AND that I had in the previous years, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX I called them because they did not close my account. Refusing to close a credit card is a violation of FDIC membership and a business practice that is unethical. I am reporting this because this practice is unacceptable. 

They did refer me to their Customer Advocate program and gave me case number XXXX ( Please redact ). I was assured that the card was closed and that I would be given written confirmation as well. I actually don't know if they are going to close the account and I have no faith in Well Fargo to actually do this and so I am pre-emptively writing the CFPB of this practice. I don't know why they didn't close the account for so many years but there needs to be something to protect the consumer because an open credit card without the consumer knowing it is open is a inherent financial security risk."

While I recognize I had recently requested an increase, since that time my financial circumstances have dramatically changed since I relocated, started my first career job after graduating from college, and purchased a condominium. On the same day, Wells Fargo issued a denial letter without considering my current credit worthiness. 

My call to Wells Fargo resulted in connecting with a representative who had no interest in helping me through the process to secure the requested increase in my cards credit limit. She never requested the information I was prepared to provide as justification for my limit request. She simply indicated I would receive a letter with a decision, a decision she knew would be a denial without the additional information I was ready to offer. She was abrupt to end our conversation. 

Had the representative shown the initiative to ask for information which supports my current request for a credit limit increase she would have learned : My credit score after taking a hit during my condo purchase process was XXXX I have equity of more than 20 % in my recently purchased condo I am fully employed earning income sufficient to qualify for the increase I requested I have a relationship with Wells Fargo beyond this credit card account Subsequent to that abbreviated conversation, Wells Fargo never initiated contact with me to secure the information I was prepared to provide to support my request for a credit limit increase. Wells Fargo simply moved ahead and denied my request. 

My complaint is Wells Fargo, following the process described above, denied my request without allowing consideration of additional information which supports my credit worthiness for such a credit limit increase. I respectfully request 1 ) the CFPB present my concerns to Wells Fargo and 2 ) Wells Fargo use information about my current credit worthiness to reconsider my request."

5445,"Two months ago, I started using a Wells Fargo "" Active Cash '' Visa Credit Card. It came with a credit limit of only {$2500.00}, which was surprisingly low given my credit score, income, and lack of debt outside of an affordable mortgage. ( for context, my other credit card is a XXXX XXXX XXXX with a credit limit of {$19000.00}. Given that I quickly pay off any charges on a credit card, I decided to try to work within the {$2500.00} credit limit for the sake of the superior cash back rewards. 

On multiple occasions, I have paid off my Outstanding Balance to {$0.00} but it has then taken days and days for my Available Revolving Line of Credit to reflect the payment - even though it has been several days since the money was actually drafted from my checking account. When calling about this issue, they stated that my available credit should be restored in 3-5 business days- even though my money had already been drafted out of my checking account - because I paid from a "" non-Wells Fargo '' account. If Wells Fargo is already in possession of my money, the institution that previously held that money should not matter when it comes to restoring my available credit. 

As an example, I made a large payment on XX/XX/XXXX and another large payment on XX/XX/XXXX for work travel charges that took my Outstanding Balance to {$0.00}. My XXXX  checking account shows both payments as being drafted on XX/XX/XXXX. Wells Fargo reflects these payments in my Outstanding Balance. Yet my Available Revolving Line of Credit still sits at just {$54.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX, with no restoration in sight. The only relevant language on this issue in the card 's Disclosure Statement says, "" Some of your available line of credit may be held, at our discretion, until your payment is honored. '' When should my payment be honored, if not when Wells Fargo already has my money? Withholding available credit for days after Wells Fargo is already in possession of money that came from a "" non-Wells Fargo '' account is a dirty business practice to attempt to create more Wells Fargo accounts. 

Additionally, Wells Fargo limits the number of payments that can be made online in a given month if they come from a "" non-Wells Fargo '' account. This practice is not disclosed anywhere in the credit card Disclosure Statement. It's yet another dirty business practice to try to make a product so inconvenient to use that customers will eventually opt to open Wells Fargo accounts just to make a credit card usable. 

As a potential solution, I asked for my credit limit to be raised. This was declined because they deemed the card to be too new. That is an irrelevant excuse for a customer with an XXXX credit score, gross income of almost {$120000.00} per year, and no debt other than a mortgage that represents less than 19 % of my income. 

( for context again, my XXXX XXXX XXXX restores my available credit instantly upon payment, does not limit the payments I can make, and raises my credit limit just from me updating my income online - even though I pay any charges on that card from the same XXXX XXXX checking account that Wells Fargo uses as an excuse ) The comically low credit limit, payment limitations, and withholding available credit for several days after payment has already been received ( but not yet "" honored '' ) is all part of the Wells Fargo - a company fined in XXXX for fraudulently opening millions of accounts without consent - plan to generate more Wells Fargo accounts by imposing inconvenient credit card rules on customers without correctly disclosing the terms either before of after the credit card account was established."

5454,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Wells Fargo to initiate a Balance transfer to the card within my posted Credit Limit. I had tried to complete the transfer myself online but messaging indicated I had to call. It took me a couple of days to have time so call was made aprox XXXX on Sat XX/XX/XXXX. The person I spoke to was not very helpful, I indicated what I wanted to do he mentioned there was a fee which I had not considered and I was transferring over slightly less then my credit limit I wasn't sure the approx XXXX would cover the difference. I asked him what the fee would be and then he indicated that my transaction was declined. What? I wasn't even over to my limit. He couldn't answer my question and them offered to transfer me to an Underwriter. Still very confused I told him to do that. The underwriter then explains that she will need to pull a full credit report? I told her I was attempting to use my posted credit limit WHY would I need my credit pulled and that was when she informed my that the last rep had pull a soft pull and that was declined and she couldn't answer my questions w/o and tri-merge report. I told her no and hung up. 
If I want to transfer funds within my credit limit that should be allowed online along with the charge for the transfer by dollar range etc.. This felt to me like I was being scammed. I have a credit limit, I do not want any other credit lines with Wells Fargo and my question was never answered. Nor did I know or understand the first rep I spoke with was pulling my credit as a soft pull. I indicated I was within my credit limit. This is unacceptable to me."

Contacted customer service after I looked at my last 2 statements and saw the 2- {$200.00} bank adjustments she directed me to that were put onto my account. 1 of those {$200.00} adjustments were put onto my account as a purchase instead. That customer service representative claimed that WF had a system issue that credited many accounts with too many payments so those charges were the bank 's adjustments. I confirmed my bank account was not drawn for those {$400.00} worth of payments but my issue was with how WF posted one of their adjustments to my account as a purchase and charged me interest on that transaction. Although they claim they resolved the issue on my account, I will not be able to see whether that is true for 1-2 billing cycles. This complaint is being filed on behalf of the many other customers that were affected by WF posting their bank adjustments ( to correct their overpayment error ) as purchases and are profiting through interest that should not be charged to their customers."
5466,"I applied for Wells Fargo credit card and despite having XXXX credit score - my application was denied by Wells Fargo. Upon calling- i was told to wait for the letter ( which i am attaching with this ). 
Strangely my spouse who has lower credit score than me- got this card."
5468,On my  Wells Fargo Visa card. I was charged a Minimum Interest Charge of {$1.00} on a balance of {$4.00}. That is an annual interest rate of over 250 %! This far exceeds the quoted interest rate on the card of 21.90 %. I believe that the company has made a false statement since their Interest Charge Calculation on the very same bill makes no mention of minimum interest charges. Please help stop this deceptive and unfair practice. There is no reason why a card should be permitted to have a minimum interest charge.
5469,When I altray fist got my wells fargo active cash card we me and my husband has documentation that there would be no charges on both cards for 18 months. we both had cash advances option that was stated we would be charge fee for cash advance. i have had credit cards for over 12 years and i understand how they work but this company waits until i make the monthly payment and then go back and add money 2 my balance every month. First question is why isnt it included in the monthly payment. you cant keep adding money 2 my balance once i pay it down the 2 thing my husband got a cash advance also but they don't charge him extra fees. and the point i making is you pay for a cash advance when you get the cash and i only got 2 they charge me then the only thing they can do after that is charge intrest on cash and that should be included in my monthly payment. the second thing is i had card for 8 months than all sudden they started adding money on the account every month after i have made the payment we original got cards in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX just had them a year. no intrest on purchases for 18 months both cards. and i have several credit cards and this is only card they do this on. i saying its fraud.

5471,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from XXXX, the fraud claims number for Wells Fargo. The individual on the other line claimed there was fraudulent activity on my card, proceeded to read me my entire card number, tell me my birthday, home address and other personal information that should only be known by Wells Fargo. These individuals had all of this information in their possession, and asked me personal information to close the card, including sending me a text message from the Wells Fargo direct text line XXXX, which Wells Fargo advises customers to save in their contacts as "" Wells '' to know that it is legitimate. The callers continued asking me for information, including my social security number at which point I became suspicious and hung up the phone and immediately called the Wells Fargo number on the back of my credit card. This representative asked me several identifying questions similar to the previous caller, for which I did provide being that I was the one to call them and felt comfortable sharing this information. I reported the details to the representative and was assured this was fraudulent, the call had not come from them, and the charges would be promptly removed from my account as they were quite clearly fraudulent. Wells Fargo is denying my claim for fraud, even though this was an unauthorized use of my credit card and refuse to help me resolved this by means of a 'chargeback ' or any other means to the merchant. The sum of money totals to {$14000.00}. After denying the claim, I called Wells Fargo back and shared my disgust and frustration with the situation, and requested an investigation internally to prove that this activity was fraudulent. They also told me that this investigation would prompt dispute of the claim for reconsideration. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX to check on the status of my resolution and spoke with XXXX XXXX who reported that the dispute had not been submitted for reconsideration like I was made to understand and had I not called, the situation would remain stagnant and unresolved. I was transferred to the fraud department where I spoke with XXXX who made it clear to me that this was not opened for reconsideration and would be denied again unless I provided a police report or other supporting documentation. I could not come to an understanding with them as to why this was denied, so I was transferred over to the dispute department to try to get this resolved and after confirming my identity to them, was put on hold for thirty ( 30 ) minutes before being disconnected without speaking to someone about this situation. This is complete negligence and refusal to acknowledge or work with a customer on Wells Fargo 's behalf, a clear misrepresentation of their claims to provide zero liability for fraud, and clear evidence that Wells Fargo, a company recently indicted and found guilty for their own internal fraudulent behaviors, quite clearly has no focus on redressing customer relations, especially those customers that remained with them while being affected by their own misconduct. This transaction was quite clearly fraudulent, as after doing research on the merchant myself, found that the charges are for a hotel in the XXXX, somewhere I have never travelled to or have any association with."
5472,"On numerous occasions, I've asked a Wells Fargo "" banker '' why I can't get a credit card? I get one or all of these answers : 1. My credit score is too low ( it's XXXX ) 2. You have too many inquiries ( most from Wells Fargo ) or applications for credit ( they look for how much credit I'm taking on ) but they NEVER ask if it's me! 
3. You have to prove you want one by increasing your credit score This absolutely infuriates me as I have ALWAYS had a credit card and have never before been denied one until I transferred my banking to Wells Fargo.

There are also several areas within their online banking process that requires the use of a cell phone! Since I can't as yet afford one, I asked how they accommodate those of us who do not have a cell phone. Their reply was : get a cell phone!"

5478,Recently I applied for a credit card thru  Wells Fargo  I was approved for the card when I call to activate the card I was told I would need to go to my bank and have the banker call them and I would need a Id. Since their was no wellsfargo banks near me going to my personal bank would be ok. Well did this four times and I live 15 miles out of town after the fourth trip I was told I would have to step into a  Wells Fargo  bank so I drove to  XXXX  Texas which is about a three hour trip from my home to take care of this. I met with the banker their and she was very helpful made copies of my Id and copies of  XXXX  bills they needed. So i left with the understanding all was good then the next day they wanted full pages of the bills so trip back to town to fax the copies. The very next day  XXXX  get a call from a lady that said she never received them I said I have confirmation that you did she said the fax machine was at the other end of the building and she had not looked yet. They kept telling me that a hold had been placed on the card because of recent activity that had been on the card and to activate I would need to call the number provided so we could clear this up we 'll soon as I would call they would tell me that they could not discuss this matter with me that I would need to step into the branch to get it cleared up but the letter I received clearly stated that I was to call them. Each time I was told the same thing. Still I have not got a straight answer because they will not discuss it with me. The lady that had helped me at the  XXXX   XXXX  branch in  XXXX  filled a complaint on them Also. They have lied to me cost me money and time jumping thru all the hoops and they want talk to me about a card that has my name on it yet they are telling me that 's it 's activity on the card but the card has never been activated. Something very shady about this hole deal. I have dates for each event that has taken place emails sent to them And records of all of it. I this normal practice for a bank because it does n't seem Very professional my bank even thought it was strange. Why send me a letter telling me to call them to get the matter cleared up then tell me they can not discuss it with me. Biggest dog and pony show I 've ever seen. Can you please tell me what I need to do. The card is showing up on my credit report and shows the balance but I ca n't use it.
5479,"I am the Power of Attorney for my XXXX year old mother, who is XXXX, XXXX, has XXXX and lives in Alabama. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, a caregiver living in my mother 's house, had himself fraudulently declared my mother 's Power of Attorney. I was unaware of this : the correct legal route is to have the current Power of Attorney removed ( myself in XX/XX/XXXX when he did this ) and have a new POA created. This was not done. This caregiver used a small town southern real estate attorney to make this change. This attorney no longer practices law. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, when I discovered that the POA had been changed, I used my mothers elder care attorney of many years to remove the fraulent caregiver POA and reinstate me, her daughter. I filed a police report with the local authorities about the financial elder abuse aspect of the situation. ( At the time of the fradulent POA creation, my mom was well into her XXXX ). I was encouraged to sue the caregiver who had himself declared POA by mom 's elder care attorney and by the local detective who investigated the case, but because I was living at the time in XXXX, I decided not to. 

When I went to Wells Fargo bank to have the former caregiver removed from mom 's bank account, they informed me that mom had a credit card in her name ( she is XXXX, and completely dependant, so can not use a credit card ). Because only the former caregiver and my mother were listed on the account, I was told I could not have access to any information about the account. ( I did later learn that the credit card has a 22 % interest rate! ) The credit card had, at the time, a {$5000.00} balance which I began paying off in increments of {$120.00} a month from my mother 's Wells Fargo checking account. 

Currently my mother lives in her own home and is cared for by a live-in caregiver ( after the criminal caregiver was removed ) and subsists on her small Social Security stipend. This year, as her financial agent, wanting to keep mom at home and to be able to continue to pay caregivers, I had to make tough financial decisions. I went to the local Wells Fargo office and spoke to XXXX XXXX, Branch Manager in XXXX XXXX, AL. I described the situation to the branch manager and told her about XX/XX/XXXX Code of Alabama Title 38 - PUBLIC WELFARE Chapter 9E - Protecting Alabama 's Elders Act which has a section about elder financial abuse. XXXX XXXX created a case # ( XXXX ) and directed me to call a Wells Fargo executive ( XXXX XXXX XXXX who, I was told, was in the highest level of Wells Fargo Executive offices in XXXX, OR. XXXX XXXX was completely not receptive to the elder abuse aspect of the situation and told me to continue paying on the account. I stopped the automatic withdrawal payments and have not been paying on the account since the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Now I am receiving daily calls from Wells Fargo ( my mom 's phone number has since been disconnected to save money, so they are calling my personal number ). 

Given the original amount of the credit card balance has been paid, I'm requesting the remainder ( interest and fees ) be forgiven."
5487,"Today I receive an email stating that an account have been approved and opened with Wells Fargo that I did apply for. The following email was a change of information to an unknown email.

I believe it is an unauthorized payment that XXXX is unwilling to dispute / revert for me. 

On XX/XX/2022, XXXX 's property manager, a new tenant, and I signed a "" Change in Roommate Amendment '' for me to transfer the lease out to the new tenant. Clause 4 of it explicitly stated that It is agreed that XXXX XXXX ( vacating resident 's name ( s ) ) ( hereinafter "" Vacating Resident ( s ) '' ), shall be released of all responsibility under the Lease as of XX/XX/2022 ( attachment 1 ). 

On XX/XX/2022, in preparation for my move-out, I paid the remaining balance of {$200.00} with XXXX to XXXX ( attachment 2 ), and then changed my home address on XXXX rent payment setup from XXXX to a new address. On XXXX app, it states that my new landlord isnt currently set up to accept the XXXX XXXX directly without fees, and offered several options to set up, so I assume this is sufficient to cancel the rent payment to XXXX. 

On XX/XX/2022, I received a payment overdue email from XXXX. This is when I realized XXXX had failed to terminate my account and associate the apartment unit with the new tenants account. To avoid any payment, I canceled all autopay setup and deleted all my bank accounts from XXXX account ( attachment 3 and 4 ). 

However, on XX/XX/2022, I received an email from XXXX saying that my rent payment was submitted for an amount of {$1800.00}, which matches the overdue amount ( attachment 5 ). 

I called XXXX customer service immediately. The agent told me that since I have been paying for the same landlord with XXXX since XXXX, if the landlord manually charges me on my XXXX card, XXXX  will authorize it, and the only thing I can do is to ask for the money back from XXXX ( attachment XXXX ). 

I dont believe this is how credit cards should practice. I have done everything I could ( except for closing this credit card ) to prevent the payment that I am not responsible for from happening, by changing my payment setup address on XXXX canceling autopayment, and deleting all bank account information. All these are clear instructions that this rent payment is not authorized. Further, after providing all the details during the customer service call, the agents argument sounds to me like since youve been paying them, we will help you to pay them if they ask for it, even if you dont agree."

This way I will secure my minimum payment for next 5 months. Also, the in this process, my principal balance will be reduced immediately. If the bank/credit card company would allow this, then I will be saving late fees, insufficient fund fees etc.     I have called them to make payment arrangements for next several months ; however, credit card company 's policy would not allow this change. {$300.00} can be applied to principal balance and I would still responsible for minimum payment following months regardless of my financial resources. Also, if the payment is not made or return, there will be additional charges and fees. I hope to see this change to avoid late fees and other charges resulting me of financial help.

Well 's Fargo credited a total of {$110.00} to my account on XX/XX/XXXX, but charged me {$71.00} for not paying the balance on my statement ( for XXXX ) I did not pay additional charges as these were the charges for late fees and interest that did NOT belong on the account. 

I spoke with representative XXXX, at Wells Fargo, this morning who says that the charge can not be reversed.

I went over this with XXXX, via a telephone call that just ended minutes ago. She told me that if I logged in and paid this amount today, my next statement would be {$500.00}.

At the same time XXXX told me on the site that I was being refunded by the chargeback! They continued to show a refund owing until XX/XX/XXXX, then removed the refund from the account XX/XX/XXXX. ( I have screenshots of all of this ). 

I'm totally at a loss, it's basically outright theft of $ XXXX from my small business and my poor staff never got a vacation. I still can't believe XXXX could get away with it and Visa didn't defend me, why isn't the chargeback system working?"
5509,"My credit card was restricted for no explanation from Wells Fargo, and I need to unblock it."
5511,"Starting in the  XXXX  if  XXXX , I began to experience financial hardships. I request ed that Wells Fargo w ork with me to lower the APR on my account and establish a payment plan that I could fit into my budget. This included an initially lowered monthly balance due, with it increasing as I paid off other financial obligations and money became available. The company agents refused, but did offer a short term payment plan to cover the delinquent amount due on my account. I fulfilled that plan. However, I was subsequently unable to make the bank-stipulated payments. Between the   XXXX   of  XXXX  and  XXXX   XXXX  ( approx.  XXXX   )  I repeatedly tried to make a repayment arrangement w ith Wells Fargo age nts, but was repeatedly told that they do not make repayment agreements ( that they would only accept payments in the amount listed in the monthly bill ), and that I should just contact them if I am able to make payments in the future. On  XXXX   XXXX , I was sent a letter informing me that my account was being reported as a loss."
5514,"On XX/XX/21, fraud was committed on my checking and credit card accounts with Wells Fargo. 
{$7200.00} was sent via cash advance from the platinum credit card into the checking account. 
From the checking account, the perpetrator wired the {$7200.00} ( from the credit card ), along with around {$2000.00} ( from my checking ) to another account. A wire transfer fee of {$30.00} was charged to my checking, a {$360.00} cash advance fee & {$61.00} interest charge were charged to my credit card. Charges are still present & fees continue to pile on I reported this to WELLS FARGO on the day that this occurred & communicated that I did NOT authorize any of these transactions. Representative filed a claim and assured me that this issue would be investigated & resolved. Also, I was told that the issue would be addressed and my funds restored within 10 business days. I have called regularly to check in on the status but there is still no resolution. 
Wells Fargo has claimed it resolved the issue by nulling the associated fees to my checking ( {$30.00} wire fee ) and credit card ( fees listed above ) a month later and applying a {$420.00} credit to the credit card so instead of {$7200.00} being owed, its now {$6700.00}. Also they said they lowered the interest rate for the credit balance owed ( due to the fraud ). Like this was all a favor to me. This is NOT acceptable and they need to do better. It is not feasible to expect a person who did not spend the funds to suddenly pay off a balance of over $ XXXX. 
This complaint is my second with CFPB against WF. WFs resolution ( detailed above ) IS NOT acceptable. 

This is their job. They were/are supposed to protect their consumers accounts and if fraud does occur, to quickly act so that the consumer can have their funds recovered. 

Despite Wells Fargo having years of transaction records for me, it still failed to identify and protect me from the fraud when it was clear that my bank accounts showed extremely irregular banking activity. 

The fraudster was able to gain access to my online Wells Fargo account by having my login, and proceeded to complete a cash advance from my credit card to checking account, and wire transfer thousands of dollars to a bank unfamiliar to me and to which I do not hold an account with, all without my consent. 

At no time during any of the transactions or before did any Wells Fargo employee or representative take any action to halt the cash advance or wire transfer or protect me from fraudulent activity related to my online account actions. 

Despite the extremely irregular and large transfers in a very short period of time, occurring in my Wells Fargo account and the unauthorized remote logins, Wells Fargo failed to timely act, secure and protect my money. 

Wells Fargo owed a contractual and fiduciary duty to protect my ( the consumer ) funds. The company breached its own Deposit Account Agreement by failing to take proper action to stop the fraud and by failing to immediately recall the wire transfer, which Wells Fargo neither flagged or attempted to stop. 

Wells Fargo is guilty of negligence/voluntary assumption of duty, breach of contract, and violating unfair trade practices and consumer protection law."

I telephoned the bank on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to a representative who referred me to a customer advocacy group at XXXX. I spoke to an escalation representative named XXXX who was sympathetic but unable to help. 

The story from the Wells Fargo representatives is that : 1 ) I performed electronic payments from my checking account XXXX to my credit card account XXXX on many occasions. 
2 ) On a few of those occasions, Wells Fargo applied an incorrect Transaction Date 3 ) To correct the transaction date, Wells Fargo is reversing the credit However, Wells Fargo is reversing my payment, but not reapplying the payment with the correct transaction date. This results in Wells Fargo debiting my checking account, but not applying the corresponding amount to my credit card. Effectively, Wells Fargo is misappropriating funds from me by debiting my checking account but not crediting my credit card account. 

The following charges on my credit card account XXXX represent invalid reversals of legitimate payments out of my checking account. 

Transaction date, Posting date, Amount, Description XX/XX/2021, XX/XX/2021, {$46.00}, Online Payment XX/XX/2021, XX/XX/2021, {$160.00}, Online Payment XX/XX/2021, XX/XX/2021, {$80.00}, Online Payment XX/XX/2021, XX/XX/2021, {$100.00}, Online Payment XX/XX/2021, XX/XX/2021, {$510.00}, Bank Adjustment Total to date : {$890.00} So at this time, there are just under {$900.00} of invalid bank-originated charges on my credit card account, and I have been unable so far to get this corrected. 

Assistance would be greatly appreciated. 

Sincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"
5518,"XXXX I logged into my Wells Fargo account and it shows a banner that has pre approved offers for credit cards. As I have not had but 1 inquiry in the past 5 years. And recently paying off things that were on my credit, I thought it would be a good time since Im pre approved from the offer from my bank. I have a personal checking. A business checking. Business savings. And business credit card with Wells Fargo. I thought my personal credit must be looking good since they are pre approving me for personal credit cards. Well after I logged into the page Wells Fargo populates all the information and comes back with a denial. I called the next day XXXX and I was on the phone for 1:30 trying to talk to an underwriter to show what was on my credit is marked for deletion and have the papers to prove it. So there really shouldnt be an issue with approving this account. Especially since once again I was pre approved. They transferred me to 4 different people. Most being rude. And refused to get me to an underwriter. They should be a business of their word and extend credit as they have put 2 inquirys on my record in 1 day. They need to remove an inquiry and also extend credit as they pre approved."
5519,"My payment was due on XXXX. It had been mailed a week in advance. On XXXX Wells Fargo emailed me and said a payment had not been received as of the due date. I assumed my payment was lost in the mail, so I immediately did a bank transfer. The next day the Wells Fargo web site shows my original payment had been credited on XXXX, the day before the email had been sent. My second payment was credited the day it was sent on XXXX. Now Wells Fargo is telling me it will be returned in 11 business days. 1 ) Why was the email ever sent on the fifth if payment was received and credited on the 4th? I am not their only customer, so how many others did what I did? 2 ) Why does it take 11 business days for Wells Fargo to return an erroneously solicited second payment when it takes me less than two minutes? This is ridiculous. The program could easily and simply check to see if a payment has been made just before an email is sent, not the day before, and Wells Fargo can certainly schedule a just refund as quickly as I can. Wells Fargo still has not learned anything about customer value."

5526,This is a formal request for an investigation of this account. There is a possibility that this information may be inaccurate.
5527,"I had a checking account with Wells Fargo. ( I had had this account for 16 years ). This account was linked to my Wells Fargo credit card. Each month I could automatically pay my Wells Fargo credit card bill. I had it set up so that if I took no action the minimum required payment would automatically be taken out of this Wells Fargo checking account. That way even if I got busy my credit card would always be paid on time! Out of no where in XXXX 2017 Wells Fargo closed this checking account. Because they closed this account my credit card payments on the Wells Fargo credit card were then NOT being paid. I was totally unaware of this and I do not believe that Wells Fargo did enough to notify me that they were closing this checking account. It was very surprising especially since I had had that account for so long.
Apparently they had changed their policy and this account was being closed because it did not have the required number of transactions per month. I never got a phone call to notify me of this information. To me this is especially shocking and upsetting since I had been a customer for such a long time and had a record of paying my bill on time. Then Wells Fargo started to send me letters stating that my balance had not been paid. I received the first letter on XXXX XXXX, I did n't look at the letter at the time as my XXXX child had been born the XXXX XXXX. By XXXX XXXX, they sent me another letter stating that I was delinquent on this account and that a payment of XXXX had to be paid immediately. I also did n't get this letter until several days later. Finally I got another letter on XXXX XXXX that stated that I had to pay a minimum of XXXX. This was the first time that this matter was brought to my attention and I was horrified. I immediately paid the XXXX. Even though I worked hard to rectify this situation Wells Fargo still put a hit on my credit score. This has severely impacted my credit score. Currently I am trying to buy a new home and my ability to lock in a competitive rate is being affected by my low credit score. All of this had happened because Wells Fargo closed an account I had that was paying them on time every month. I feel that this situation was Wells Fargo 's fault. As they first set me up to not pay my credit card bill, then charged me enormous fees when my payment was late and then finally they hit my credit score and damaged my credit history when none of this was my fault."
5528,"I have a Wells Fargo Active Cash card I applied for in XXXX. To start, the credit limit they gave me was insulting. My most recent issue has to do with a payment I made. I made a payment on XX/XX/2022, which posted to my account online and was taken from my checking account on XX/XX/2022. My card was declined at a grocery store today, XX/XX/2022, but when I left the grocery store the charge was sent to me from Wells Fargo 4 times. I called Wells Fargo and they told me I could not use the card because I reach my limit. They said that my account payment was on hold for XXXX weeks to ensure that the funds are legitimate. I have use this same checking account to pay off my card before, they already have taken the funds out of my checking account 2 days ago, and they also posted the funds as if they cleared to my card on my online banking. How can a credit card company take my funds from my checking account and not post them/hold them on their end when theyve already taken the money? I am not sure how to move forward with this, but this is completely unacceptable and in my eyes fraudulent. If I made my payment and they took the money, it should be applied to my account on the date the money with withdrawn from my checking."
5531,"I failed to receive statements from Well Fargo many months ago on an account that was opened and has been in good standing for approximately a decade. Not having received a XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX statement, I proactively called and requested statements and to immediately pay all balances in full with a Wells Fargo representative ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX timeframe ). The representative said the prior month 's statement balance was approximately $ 600- {$700.00} and I advised that I wanted to pay the statement balance off in full. I requested and instructed the Wells Fargo representative to pay approximately {$2000.00} at that time, representing greater than three times the full statement balance. Later in the day, I went to use the subject card and it was declined at a merchant. I called Wells Fargo and was advised that the account was 1 ( ONE ) day past due and the account was therefore blocked. I advised the representative that I paid three times the amount of the full statement balance and was told that it didn't matter. I then asked to close the account and was refused by the representative, being advised that I would have to wait several days to close the account. I called back within several days and explained the situation was advised that the account block was released and available for use and that interest and fees were being added as I was one day late, regardless of whether I received a statement or not. Rather as I was informed, it was my responsibility to log online and determine what my balance was. Again, I requested that the account be closed and was refused. I asked to speak to a manager and was repeatedly refused for that request and told that no managers were available. I was told that I must leave my name and number and someone would call back in 24 - 48 hours. I again called back several days later and restated the course of events that occurred over the past several days. Finally, I was transferred to the executive offices, which I later learned are truly not executive offices, but rather Wells Fargo general customer services offices. I explained the situation and after the representative argued with me for 20-30 minutes, it was agreed that the late fees and interest be waived for the original statement. I was told that I would be contacted soon by a manager to discuss the whole matter. After three more weeks and no response from Wells Fargo, I called them back and was advised that the case was closed and that some representative had called and not received an answer so their policy is that they close the case ''. A gentleman by the name of XXXX reopened the case in early XXXX and promised to contact me or have a manager contact me soon. I have received no contact since that discussion. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Wells Fargo again requesting a statement and my balance, so that I could pay off my statement in full. The representative I spoke with at the 'Executive Office '' ( customer service office again ) was rude, abrasive and ended up telling me no manager was available and that no one else could talk to me. She then hung up the phone when I asked to speak to anyone. I called back again and explained the situation and was told the case was still open but that the representative that I just spoke with left no notes and could not be identified. WELLS FARGO CASE NUMBER : XXXX. Add this to the fact that I have REPEATEDLY requested that we be contacted about the fraudulent opening of a DDA account by a Wells representative involving our daughter. Two years ago our daughter lost her debit card. I advised her to visit the Wells Fargo retail office in XXXX, FL to deactivate the debit card and order a new one. When she went to the office the Wells Fargo representative lied and told her that she could not obtain a new debit card, but that the only way to get a new debit card was to open a new DDA account. Once we found out about the lies of the Wells Fargo account representative, I sent my daughter back to the branch and the representative was rude and made my college-age daughter cry. I then called the manager of the office who advised me he would look into the situation and never called back. The original account was a student account and the new account was an account that required minimum balances and accrued fees. This was FRAUD for employee bonus points and to generate fee income. I have called Wells to address this issue endlessly and they have avoided addressing it as they say that my wife and I are not on the account so we can not discuss it. That is correct as they closed the account with my wife 's name on it and opened a new account with only our daughters name on it, prohibiting us from accessing an account we established by changing it for benefit of employee bonuses. This avoidance has gone on for OVER TWO YEARS with only empty promises to address by Wells Fargo."
5536,"We are paying over the Minimum payment each month and the overage is not being applied to the account ( Cash Advances ) with the higher Interest rate, currently 26.240 %. Instead, Wells Fargo is applying the overage payment to the lesser interest rate account ( Purchases ) 11.490 %. Consequently, I'm paying off the lower interest account faster, however the higher interest account is just piling on more interest and not getting paid off at all. In essence, I'm incurring more debt. 
I have contacted the bank via phone XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to rectify the problem. I spoke with a representative, XXXX  and then XXXX. XXXX  put in a request for a Case Manager to contact me back via phone or email. Case # XXXX Wells Fargo Bank sent me a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that "" According to the Wells Fargo Business Credit Card Customer Agreement , payments and any credits to your Account will be applied in the order determined by the Bank at its sole discretion. Generally, payments are first applied to Bank Fees and Finance Charges then to the lower interest rates and then to balances with higher interest rates.

I called WF to dispute this unauthorized transactions and after a couple of phone transfers, agent-supervisor-card dept., etc., finally I got to the Wells Fargo fraud dept XXXX and the amounts were settled and cleared. On that same phone conversation, It was also confirmed that I even ended up having a - {$70.00} balance ( overpayment ) upon further review of my credit card account. 
And promised me of repayment. On XX/XX/XXXX I've decided then to close the credit card account to avoid another incident to happen. 
Please see attached files showing my closed credit card account. Two are screen shots from my computer. 

Now come XXXX, I am not aware, until recently that Wells Fargo has put back one of the unauthorized transaction ( {$250.00} ) on my now closed credit card account. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I went to WF branch here in XXXX, TX to dispute again this transaction. This time I asked the bankers assistance to call WF to explain everything again. So the banker helped me out in explaining my case to card dept.-fraud dept. etc. 
After more than an hour of discussion, a case number was created for this issue. I requested an email correspondence for future communication. 

XXXX XXXX, XXXX, they sent me thru email the result of their investigation, which of course is in to their favor. ( Please see attached file, Wells Fargo Message.pdf ). This is very unfair and unacceptable. 

I really don't know what else to do/ where else to complain. All this time this has ruined my credit score, because of the fraudulent amount they put back in my now closed account. It's been a very frustrating and tiring experience."
5553,I had originally filed a claim with Wells Fargo for a merchant who didnt payback my winnings at the XXXX online casino. Wells Fargo opened a claim and I lost the investigation even though the company never responded to the dispute. Wells Fargo asked me to send in documentation with a follow up call. I did follow through with the the documentation and call. I then have a card reversal or a provisional credit and it drawn my balance into the negative. Wells Fargo claimed I didnt send documentation but what they received wasnt a pdf to what they prefer and never decided to call me to send in the right format. I spoke to 3 different specialists and they all gave me a different answer. One said resend the documents. Another said the case was closed. This happened all in the same day and was told I cant re file another claim. Do not trust this bank. They try to manipulate and discredit customers in every way.

Our divorce papers clearly state that he was responsible for all credit card debts, and was to remove me from all cards. He passed away, and Wells Fargo moved the card into my name. I have continually contacted Wells Fargo concerning this since XX/XX/2022. I was denied identity theft as of XX/XX/2022 ; which was what I was told to do first. I have been denied mediation as of a letter dated XX/XX/2022. I contacted Wells Fargo XX/XX/2022 and was told by the fraudulent claims department that it was still open for mediation and to contact them. I contacted meditation directly after and was told it is not open for mediation that it is open in fraudulent claims. I have tried diligently to find out how I was ever an authorized user, and have been told by Wells Fargo that it was automatic. I never had a card, never signed to be an authorized user, and never used this card. I would like this debt to be taken out of my name."

This has resulted in 3 recent inquiries on my credit report, which has lowered my credit score, and that has resulted in a lowering of my credit rating from "" very good '' to just "" good.

I received a letter in the mail dated XX/XX/XXXX, that states my account is closed due to inactivity. Upon receiving the letter on XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke with one of Wells Fargo 's customer service representatives. She indicated that the account was not closed that I need to activate the card then use it to prevent the card from being closed. I explained to the representative that I need to locate the card to activate. She asked that I call back once locating the XXXX. After searching, I located a card that expired XX/XX/XXXX. I called back to advise them I did not find the new card -- and was told by another representative that the account was closed. I asked how so ... when 5 minutes ago the account remained open. The representative apologized but repeated your account is closed. I asked to speak with a manager- I was transferred, but wasn't certain I was actually speaking with management because that person did not provide any assistance other to say I can reapply. I explained Wells Fargo did not provide an opportunity for me to keep the XXXX account open. You never sent a notification prior to closing my account? He did not reply. Only repeated, I can reapply because the credit card is closed and Wells Fargo does not offer that type account anymore. I advise this action does not sit well with me and I will be taking this complaint further. Not only did you not act in my best interest or give me an opportunity to decide if I wanted to close this account... you are not trying to repair the damage you caused by closing my account. My payment history is flawless with your company. And my credit history with the credit bureaus are Very important. By closing my account this will definitely cause an issue with my credit score. Is this some type of tactic Wells Fargo is using to get people to apply for additional credit? I am very disappointment with your service and this company. Why would any company try to penalize a consumer for not using their card?"
5573,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Wells Fargo ( XXXX ) that contained an access code to view my application for new credit. While I do currently have a Wells Fargo credit card, I have not applied for any new credit. At first, I thought the email might be a scam, but upon closer inspection, it appears to be a legitimate email from Wells Fargo. I tried contacting them by phone on XX/XX/XXXX but got bounced around to different people, because no one could tell me what the access code was for. I also forwarded the email to an email address on the Wells Fargo site for reporting suspicious communication and received an automated response but have heard nothing since. I'm concerned that someone may be applying for credit using my identity or that Wells Fargo is fraudulently opening new accounts in my name, as I'm aware they've done to their customers in the past. I need to know what new credit applications are in process at Wells Fargo under my name and halt the processing, but I'm unable to reach anyone at Wells Fargo who can figure out what this is about."
5575,"On XX/XX/2021 at XXXX I received a call from a Wells Fargo Agent from the credit card department and spoke with him about placing my closed credit card account on a payment plan. He read me out loud the agreements and disclosures and I said to stop, I dont want to proceed because the disclosure read that any other accounts I have with Wells Fargo will be closed. If thats the case then I said no I dont want to proceed with the payment plan. But he reassured me that he was sure that disclosure only refers to other accounts in similar standing such as default, late payments etc, but my other credit card account was open and in good standing so it wont be closed. Then he stated that if it was closed, it would be able to be reopened as long as I called back and asked to have it reopened. So he told me its fine and to continue with the agreement so I agreed to the terms and put my closed credit card account on the payment plan. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed my opened credit card account was closed. I then called and tried to get it reopened and I was told that it isnt true. Credit card accounts can never be reopened once closed. So they promoted me to create a compliant case with the executive department because I was wrongfully lead to believe it wouldnt be closed and would be able to be reopened if it was. 

After creating 3 separate cases and finally speaking with an agent from the executive department, they said the outcome was the same. They cant reopen my account because I agreed to the disclosures. Even though I explicitly said all 3 times in each case, that I was lead to believe the disclosures meant something else from what they actually meant. I was lead to believe one thing and result occurred. Id like my account reopened and/or some sort of compensation for this wrongful act and treatment. I was swindled into thinking my account wouldnt be closed and now I have to deal with the repercussions such as my credit being negatively affected and my credit card no longer being available for use. 
Id like for the negative affect to my credit reports be removed because this was something I was fully mislead in. 

I want my account reopened and compensation for my account being closed and having to deal with this issue for 6 months now. I have not been paying the credit card account BECAUSE I dont want to pay it and have them give the excuse of youve been paying the credit card account ever since its been closed, you have now accepted its closure, when that is not the case. I will not pay the credit card UNTIL this has been resolved. So IF this is resolved then Id need ALL late fees and unrightful interest payments accrued, be removed. Because I had been paying my credit card on time and havent lead it default. So the late fees and interest payments arent rightfully on accrued."
5576,"I was in and out the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, so I wasnt actively paying attention to my bank activity nor did I realize my card was stolen because I was inside & only making purchases online where I was using my saved card details. A little over a week ago I was alerted that my account was in the negatives which made zero sense to me so I called and and had a discussion with my bank. After reviewing some charges I seemed there was multiple out of state charges so I called my bank and we filed a dispute, they told me to give them 10 business days to find a resolution.

When I spoke with the credit company on XX/XX/XXXX, they said I need to make another {$20.00} payment.

5585,"I notified Wells Fargo Bank of a billing error on my credit card. The transaction in the amount of {$470.00} XXXX  XXXX XXXX posted on XX/XX/2022 was a online order for a headlight for my vehicle. The merchant provided tracking details to me stating that the merchandise was Left at the front door in XXXX FL on XX/XX/2022 ( did not specify my address on the tracking and there are thousands of homes in XXXX FL ). I attempted to resolve with the merchant on XX/XX/2022 as I still had not received the merchandise, I contacted the merchant via there customer service number and it would ring but the call would drop after a few rings. In turn I contacted my bank to notify them of the of this billing error on XX/XX/2022, I provided them the product description within my dispute. I notified the bank via there online dispute portal which is considered a form of written notice under Reg Z section 1026.13 13 ( b ). 

I will provide the lifecycle of the dispute process next. I did not receive a written form of acknowledgement from Wells Fargo confirming my valid billing error which was reported well within 60 days. I have not received any written communication from Wells Fargo regarding the merchants response to my dispute so I can properly be provided the opportunity to respond per Visa Rules and Regulations for Reason Code 13.1 Non-Receipt of Merchandise/Services. Wells Fargo did initiate contact by calling my cell phone on two separate occasions ; they 1st called on XX/XX/2022 XXXX ( No voicemail was left ), I called them back immediately 9 minutes later at XXXX and was advised that nothing additional was needed from me and that a Pre Arbitration was submitted, I informed the representative that if anything is needed to please contact me. The 2nd call was on XX/XX/2022 at XXXX ( No voicemail was left ), I called back immediately 1 minute later at XXXX, the representative advised that they would schedule a call back same day, however no call back was ever received. The very next day my account was incorrectly reposted for the {$470.00}, this repost was invalid per Reg Z section 1026.13 Paragraph 13 ( c ) ( 2 ) which prohibits a creditor from reversing amounts previously credited for an alleged billing error if the creditor fails to mail or deliver a written explanation setting forth the reason why the billing error did not occur as asserted, or otherwise fails to comply with the error resolution procedures set forth in section 1026.13. Furthermore, the creditor generally must credit the disputed amount and related finance or other chares as applicable to the consumers account. I believe that Wells Fargo mishandled my dispute and did not properly comply with Regulation Z section 1026.13. 

I contacted the Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX to express my concerns and the mishandling of my claim. The representative within the dispute department did not answer or address any of my concerns and instead stated that a complaint would be filed with the executive office and that they would call me within the next day or so. I never received a phone call from anyone from the executive office. I received a email on XX/XX/2022 stating that my complaint would be reviewed and that they would contact me within 10 business days. Instead I received a generic email stating that my dispute was denied, with no further recourse available. This is unacceptable and did not address my complaint regarding the failure of properly following Reg Z and Visa Rules and regulations that govern disputes, specifically Reg Z section 1026.13 and Visa rules and regulation regarding Dispute Reason Code 13.1. I would like to state as i told Wells Fargo, tracking details do not remedy dispute reason code 13.1, furthermore the tracking details state the merchandise was left at the front door in the city of XXXX, FL and does not specify an address nor a signature which does not remedy reason code 13.1 non receipt of goods and merchandise, in turn signifying the dispute was in fact mishandled. 

I contacted Wells Fargo regarding the generic executive office email i received and was told the case worker is busy and can not take my call. I am filing this official complaint with the FCPB as I am hoping to rectify my situation and hopefully will lead Wells Fargo to update their policies and procedures to properly follow regulation Z and any other rules that govern credit card disputes. As of today I still have not received my merchandise and my bank has failed to protect me at no fault of my own. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

I told the collector I paid a small portion ( what I could afford ) over the weekend and she said "" yes, but your account still has  XXXX  dollars that 's past due. She repeatedly tried to schedule a payment and I told her I would pay when I had the money to. She pressed again and again, and when I caved and told her a date, she started pressing about scheduling ANOTHER payment after that  XXXX . I told her I was uninterested and that I 'm going through some financial hardship right now and asked what my options would be. She did not answer my question, and continued to ask why I would n't just let her schedule the payments. I told her because I could n't guarantee the funds in the account trying to pay the balance. I eventually hung up on her because she was insistent and I was just outside, enjoying the evening, pushing my son on his tree swing."
5588,"At  Wells Fargo , I continually set up autopay to transfer payments from my personal checking to the  Wells Fargo  account. However, their online statement ( response ) after setting up autopay is that it takes several months for it to be invoked. During this period, they will call you and say that your payment did n't successfully work, and that you need to manually pay along with a late fee of {$37.00}. Therefore, every month they do this.      Wells Fargo als o states that the wrong account codes were used when setting up autopay, so they purposely setup the customer to pay late fees.     My guess is that  Wells Fargo  managers ( a ) instruct their staff to charge late fees no matter what, and also have setup their IT system to create transfer errors, due to the recent loss of capital from the class action suit over bad practice in mortgage accounting."

I received an email stating that the application was denied because my report could n't be accessed due to the freeze. I unfroze my reports then chatted with a customer rep to ask if I needed to fill out another application or if the initial application could still be considered. I was told to fill out another application. I asked if they were sure that the system would n't recognize it as a duplicate I was told no and to fill out another. I proceeded to fill out another application. The app went into a pending status. When I called for a status update it says app was denied because I just applied. Exactly what the customer rep told me would not happen. My  XXXX  report was pulled on  XX/XX/XXXX  for consideration of the first app. On Friday  XX/XX/XXXX , i was informed that the initial application was denied due to high balances and additional reasons.

5612,"I believe the best place to start would be to provide a timeline of events thus far. My Wells Fargo credit card was stolen at some point in late XX/XX/XXXX or early XX/XX/XXXX and, over the course of 17 days in XX/XX/XXXX, that credit card was used without my authorization to complete 16 transactions totaling {$13000.00} across 4 retailers : XXXX ( {$10000.00} ), XXXX ( {$1500.00} ), XXXX ( {$1500.00} ), and XXXX ( {$600.00} ). Please note, I seldom use this card. In fact, the last time I used this card was last year. I kept it in my wallet for emergency purposes since late last year. As such, I was surprised when I received a bank statement for all the charges listed. 

I initiated my claim with Wells Fargo by calling Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims on XX/XX/XXXX after seeing my credit card statement. When I called Wells Fargo card services, I gave the banker my information and answered their questions. At the end of the call, the banker informed me that I could expect to receive my new card in a matter of a few days and would receive a follow up letter I would need to sign and return to finalize my claim. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a follow-up phone call from another banker at Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims seeking clarification with regard to my claim. I maintained that while I was familiar with the vendors where my card was used, I was not aware of where my card was or who was using it. That call ended much the same way as the first. The banker informed me that I should expect my new card any day along with a follow up letter to sign and return. 

I then received my card XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. However, the follow up letter I was expecting came in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX. Dated XX/XX/XXXX, the letter from Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims stated that fraud had not occurred and the transactions were actually authorized. That letter claimed that the merchants were able to verify at least some portion of my personal information, account number, and/or card expiration date. 

After reviewing the letter, I called back to Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims on XX/XX/XXXX, at my first opportunity, to see if there was anything else I could do. The banker I spoke to then told me my only recourse would be to file a reconsideration letter. I sent a carefully worded letter on XX/XX/XXXX. I argued that the individual ( s ) who had my card to produce these transactions could and probably would have, by default, any necessary amount of my personal information. They easily had access to my account number and/or card expiration date since those items were printed on the card. As far as my personal information was concerned, the individual ( s ) clearly had some or all of that as well. I was frustrated with Wells Fargos almost indifferent approach in trying to resolve this matter. They claimed they were trying to protect me as a customer. However, being on the hook for nearly {$14000.00} in charges at the time did not feel very protective to me. In my 18-year banking relationship with Wells Fargo, I can not recall a time where I was treated with more disregard in a personally serious financial matter. 

I received a follow-up letter from Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims on XX/XX/XXXX ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ), claiming they were taking my letter asking for reconsideration under further consideration and that I should expect to receive results of their further research within 45 days. I then received a follow-up letter from Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) stating that the research was completed, the charges were valid/authorized, and my claim was closed. Apparently, Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims fully completed an investigation in about 4 % ( 2 days ) of the time ( 45 days ) it  could possibly take. 

Frustrated by the result, I then sent an addendum of my original reconsideration letter on XX/XX/XXXX to Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims. In summary, I explained that for virtually all online purchases, which all the charges appeared to be, I have them sent to my home. I never saw any of these items at my home. Furthermore, I never received an email to one of the email addresses I administer with a receipt/order confirmation. Also, I never signed for receipt of any goods/packages. Lastly, I stated that one of the retailers, XXXX reversed their charges on XX/XX/XXXX. To them, the charges were obviously bogus. If the XXXX charges were found spurious, why werent the others? How were the remaining charges any different? 

Still frustrated, I filed an FTC identity theft report on XX/XX/XXXX ( case number : XXXX ). Also on XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a complaint with the CFPB ( case number : XXXX ). Please review the notes from my initial claim/complaint. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a follow-up letter ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) from Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims stating that my claim would be taken into reconsideration. My guess was that this was the result of my addendum letter. It was difficult to tell exactly since this letter was identical to the one Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims sent on XX/XX/XXXX that asserted they were reconsidering my claim and I should receive results within 45 days. When receiving identical ( not similar ) correspondence, its difficult not to posit that when making a claim, the banks systems automatically trigger a response without actually following through. 

On XX/XX/XXXX ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ), I received a letter from Wells Fargo Card Services and Consumer Lending informing me that they received my CFPB complaint and were researching my claim. On XX/XX/XXXX ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ), I received a letter from Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims that they completed research and determined that the charges from XXXX and XXXX were, in fact, bogus and thus, were removed from my bill. However, the letter did not state anything regarding the remaining {$10000.00} of charges from XXXX and what was happening with that lingering research. Since Wells Fargo claimed it could take upwards of 45 days to complete their research, it would be assumed they were still investigating. 

On XX/XX/XXXX ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ), I received a follow-up letter from Wells Fargo Card Services and Consumer Lending further acknowledging my claim filed with the CFPB and my frustration with the process. Wells Fargo Card Services was going to pass along all the information of my CFPB claim to Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims.  Since this letter was dated XX/XX/XXXX, I believe the CFPB falsely closed my complaint/claim on XX/XX/XXXX as a result of Wells Fargo Card Services and Consumer Lendings response. However, it was my understanding that my claim was still being investigated. We were well within the 45 days that Wells Fargo claimed they needed to complete an investigation. Since the XXXX charges were still on my account, without being acknowledged in a follow-up letter or phone call, I assumed that the investigation was ongoing. Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims did state that they would provide a decision in writing. However, nothing of the sort regarding these XXXX charges ever came. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a new bank statement from Wells Fargo Credit Card Services showing that all but the XXXX charges were credited back to my account. However, in the course of their investigation, Wells Fargo applied an interest charge of {$160.00} to my account. So, not only was I on the hook for over {$10000.00} in fabricated charges, I was now on the hook for an interest charge even while my claim was supposedly continuing to be investigated by Wells Fargo, the FTC, and the CFPB. That statement showed that I owed {$10000.00} in a lump sum payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. If we were to take into account that my claim was under that second reconsideration, as per the XX/XX/XXXX letter from Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims, 45 days would bring us to having a final decision by XX/XX/XXXX. Following the pattern of correspondence from Wells Fargo, I should then receive final confirmation on XX/XX/XXXX. No doubt, by then, I would be assessed a late payment penalty despite the fact that Im in the midst of an investigation. 

My issues can be summarized here. 1 ) Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims took my original dispute into reconsideration and said it could take upwards of 45 days to complete the investigation. However, they turned around in 2 days claiming they completed their investigation and that I was on the hook for all the charges. Although, if I hadnt pushed the issue with Wells Fargo and the CFPB, I never wouldve been relinquished from any charges, let alone the {$3600.00} worth of charges. All of the charges were from and belonged to someone else. I have never run up my credit card bill so wildly in my entire life. Since 3 of the 4 merchants forgave the charges, clearly, Im not the only one who saw the charges as phony. THEYRE ALL PHONY. Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims did not actually do any investigating and were simply paying lip service to the entire  procedure. Clearly, they didnt and dont care about a customers identity theft claim. 2 ) The follow-up letters Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims sent on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were identical. As a result, it was obvious that their responses to my claims were computer generated. They were not fulfilling their end of the bargain by investigating a very serious matter and were simply telling me they were. 3 ) I was assessed an interest fee while my identity theft claim was being investigated. This is a clearly lascivious business practice on Wells Fargos part. Not only are they not fulfilling their obligations with their investigations, theyre also finding ways to financially capitalize from them. There is no part of that which is remotely customer centric. 4 ) Just because Wells Fargo Card Services and Consumer Lending acknowledged receiving my claim, should not have meant that it was completed to the CFPB. Im still getting the runaround on an investigation and am on the hook for over {$10000.00} in spurious charges. How can this possibly be considered complete? 5 ) My claims are going around in a circle. I complained to Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims and got absolutely nowhere. I had to complain multiple times to get an semblance of traction with them. In my endless exasperation, I then complained to the CFPB. While prompt, the CFPB passed along my complaint to Wells Fargo Card Services and Consumer Lending. Wells Fargo Card Services and Consumer Lending then stated they were passing along my complaint back to Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims, which is the very department I had issues with in the first place. Based on this new claim/complaint, there was no resolution. The cycle needs to be broken and it needs to go to someone or some other department that will actually resolve the matter. 3 months of going back and forth in this affair, I am reaching my wits end. If I were able to afford to pay for someone elses $ 10,000+ counterfeit charges, I probably wouldnt be fighting so hard now. Beyond the injustice of the matter, I simply do not have the ability to fulfill this financial obligation. 6 ) While, this is only assumed, Wells Fargo will likely be tacking on a late payment fee to this {$10000.00} charge. Even though I am still pushing for further investigation of my original claim, Wells Fargos fraud claims procedures, or lack thereof, along with their indecent charging of interest on investigation cases and refusal to relinquish these fraudulent charges from my account, they are looking to capitalize even further on my victimization. 

I 'm coming forward at this time because I believe my statute of limitations is running out without having received adequate consideration in the first place. If there is any confusion regarding the timeline of events I provided, I included copies of all the letters I received from Wells Fargo Credit Card Fraud Claims as well as Wells Fargo Card Services and Consumer Lending. I also included copies of the letters I sent to Wells Fargo regarding my claim as well as verification of the statements I originally made to the FTC as well as the CFPB. Please help. Thank you."

I started to notice that all of my statements from XX/XX/XXXX back towards the opening of the account where gone and missing from my online portal. I started looking closer at the new statements from that date forward till now and realized they changed my APR from an average of XXXX % APR. to now XXXX % APR. I did not have access or possession of the prior statements Wells Fargo did and upon requesting then I get them and they had changed all theAPR on those statements to match the new APR. to implied that I paid this all along when I know I did NOT. During the dispute process with Wells Fargo they continued to charge me the interest and demanded the payments. They have continued to send me irrelevant information and false and deceptive information, statements, documentation. Plus the day they did this they obtain my consumer reports on all three Credit reporting agencies. I have given then since XX/XX/XXXX to down investigation and they still say they need more time to right up to the statement date and give me fake erroneous information just to charge the higher interest and demand it paid. I know I would not agree to any interest rate of this extortion"
5621,"Approximately one month ago I contacted Wells Fargo Bank, to reconcile a charge on my Wells Fargo credit card that all parties agreed was an accident ; my girlfriend charged our credit card ( she is the only authorized user on my credit card, for having never had a credit card in her life, ever ) and she agreed to change to a different method of payment and did so successfully on the XXXX web site, before we both contacted Wells Fargo to dispute the charge-my girlfriend changed her method of payment before Wells Fargo Bank registered the original charge in their computer database. When she and I called them, they grossly mistreated her and refused to talk to her, claiming they could only talk to me ( which the Wells Fargo Customer Service Department was proudly proven wrong, for, with the shift XXXX reprimanding several phone representatives for refusing to recognize my girlfriends right to talk to them, as was her well established right, as an authorized user on my account ; they regretted mistreating her when I was done with them ). Nonetheless, after an extensive dialogue with the Wells Fargo Credit Card Division shift XXXX, in which he agreed that because my girlfriends was changed to another method of payment and the Wells Fargo Credit usage was an honest mistake, the Wells Fargo Credit Card Division shift XXXX guaranteed that they would smooth things over with XXXX and that I would not be held liable for the charge originally put on my credit card. My girlfriend and I were told that Wells Fargo would take care of it ; roughly 2 weeks later she gets a bill in the mail for the original charge and calls me asking what to do. I told her call Wells Fargo and dispute the charge ; I called them as well and the shift XXXX was surprised and disappointed that it was taking an unusually long time for the charge to be arbitrated off my account, even though arbitration was the only way for Wells Fargo to arbitrate it off my account. My girlfriend and I were told not to pay the bill, as this would confirm the charge and confuse the issue ; wait a month and this issue would be resolved. Yesterday marked over a month ( closer to XXXX weeks ) and now I have XXXX ( my credit reporting agency ) downgrading my credit rating, from borderline good ( yellow to green ), to down XXXX points to just yellow, because Wells Fargo Credit Card Division has failed to arbitrate the charge off my account, as they promised they would and could do, easily. My girlfriend called them and they asked for a month extension, claiming they would fix the problem. I want them held accountable for failing their promise and victimizing me with a downgraded credit rating, because of their failure. Wells Fargo Credit Card XXXX promised and failed to deliver ; now theyre using time extension to bluff their way out of the promise they made and this is breach of contract."

5632,"My identity was compromised by a XXXX Scammer in XX/XX/XXXX. He used my information to open 3 major credit cards without my knowledge or consent. These were all new cards. He applied online without my consent or knowledge or my signature. I did not gain financially at all from this action. He conducted Balance Transfers by using these new credit cards. The transfers began in XXXX of XXXX. I was not aware of this at all until I started to receive statements. I was coerced to make some initial payments until I was aware these were all fraudulently done. I have not gained financially from their use. I was never aware of these cards. He acted solely for his own financial gain. I have filed reports of fraud with the local Police Department, the FTC, and the FBI. I should not be held liable for any payments to these accounts. The balance with XXXX XXXX is now {$14000.00}. 
The balance with XXXX is now {$17000.00}. The balance with Wells Fargo is now {$52000.00}. These balances are all approximate. The activity on all credit cards was done approximately between XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Each actual credit card company has the complete dates and amounts that were conducted as Balance Transfers."
5635,"Early last year XXXX, I called Wells Fargo on two separate occasions asking for a credit limit increase as I was planning to make a couple of large purchases. Wells Fargo refused to increase my credit limit both times I requested it. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo increased my credit limit from {$21000.00} to {$24000.00} without asking me, which was frustrating because the request had previously been denied when I needed it and had asked for it. Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I was close to reaching my credit limit a few times. I remember trying to use my card a few times and if the purchase took me over my credit limit, the transactions were denied, which I was grateful for, because it kept me from spending over my limit. I assumed at this point that safeguards were in place on the credit card that would prevent me from going over my limit. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I began holiday shopping and wanted to use my credit card for purchases. The transactions kept going through at the stores, so I continued making purchases and no transactions were ever denied. It wasn't until I had reached over $ XXXX in purchases over the course of the month that Wells Fargo finally started to decline purchases. I am now {$8200.00} over my credit limit, which means I am unable to use the card for other purchases, my minimum payment has significantly increased, and I'm paying even more in interest each month. I've been paying the minimum each month and it's making no difference in the overall balance, in fact it has increased between XXXX and now. Why did Wells Fargo allow this?? 

To date, Wells Fargo has failed to communicate clearly to me as their customer regarding credit limit safeguards and policies. Furthermore they have been deceptive and inconsistent regarding the allowance of purchases over the credit limit for their own profit and gain. I spoke with someone today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) in their credit card department and she said that as the customer you have to elect to have transactions declined when over the credit limit. This feature is nowhere to be found on their mobile website and this option was never presented to me. Also, if it is up to the customer to enact this option, then why were some of my previous transactions denied, but then some were allowed? It appears that Wells Fargo was making that choice for me and was doing so inconsistently. The process lacks in transparency and I believe they are acting in bad faith by allowing someone to spend $ XXXX over their limit, when previously transactions that were $ XXXX {$100.00} over were denied."
5636,"XX/XX/2021, I received an email saying XXXX was charging me some fee for buying something when i didn't buy anything. So I called the toll free number on the email and a person answered. They said log into your account and we can return your money back costing {$9000.00} as soon as I logged into my account thinking they will reimburse me, instead the people online were transferring money from my credit card to a XXXX  account. Once I made a complaint with Wells Fargo of what happened, they didn't acknowledge the complaint and said it was my fault and it's my responsibility to pay it. I told the bank ( fraud department ) of what happened and I told the bank XXXX fraud department ) didn't authorize anyone to transfer money nor I didn't know who was all transferring the money or where it was being transferred to. 

XXXX XXXX, I went back to Wells Fargo and reported fraud. Although the department once again denied me because they said since the transfers happened within my online access... the bank says it looks like i authorized it to whomever but I even told Wells Fargo, I don't know them and why would I report my own fraud ... .I wouldn't report fraud. I seriously dont know who did the transfers. I am vey dissatisfied with Wells Fargo,"
5638,"Upon opening this account, it was understood that my account is an interest free account. In the very beginning, I was notified of the payment due date and immediately informed them that this date would not work for me. They agreed on a new date that was honored by both parties. I began submitting payments on the new agreed upon payment due date. I then received a late fee that was reversed. The next month, the payment was made XXXX  day prior to the due date and they charged another late fee. Even though they were aware of the date change, the fees from this point continued to add to a current three digit amount even though I have never been late nor have I missed a payment. Upon trying to resolve this issue, the personnel that I spoke with all said the same thing. I was told there was nothing they could do after the fees reached a three digit figure unless I spoke with a Vice President ( VP ) in which I did but even they were duplicating what was previously stated to me. Before our conversation could conclude, I had to cut it short due to commitments at my place of employment. I told the VP that I would call them back to conclude our conversation but after several attempts, my calls went unanswered. I then decided to contact Consumer Finance Protection Bureau for a possible solution or resolution. I have no intentions of paying them anything other than my agreed upon monthly payment.

I called Wells Fargo VISA representative on XXXX and explained that I need to get this payment either POSTED or CANCELED. That representative suggested that I check back in a couple of days. I called back today XXXX and talked to another representative and explained the same thing to them ad nauseam. At this writing the {$160.00} transaction remains in limbo as pending, and wont post. 
Once again, I need to get this payment either POSTED or CANCELED. The payment is due now, not latter to USPS. The 2nd representative seemed to be clueless as to getting this accomplished.

Today, I emailed the person ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) who is listed on my account ( s ) as personal banker and explained all of this ad nauseam, but have not heard back.

5642,"In 2019, I discovered that I was once again the victim of identity theft. This was discovered when I received notice of several attempts at opening accounts with different creditors. I also noticed that my banking accounts held at Wells Fargo and XXXX  XXXX XXXX had a number of unauthorized transactions. These accounts were my primary accounts for managing bills and other financial transactions. Additionally, the disruption created impacted my credit card with Wells Fargo. Once I identified the unauthorized transactions across my banking and credit accounts, I quickly worked with the institutions to dispute all authorized transactions while contacting the major credit bureaus to block my credit file. New account numbers were established for my banking accounts and the old ones were closed out. For the credit card account, I made numerous attempts to dispute the unauthorized transactions with limited success. I asked that the issuer close the account as a result of the ongoing efforts to dispute charges as well as the fact there were still pending transactions being applied to the account. 

This process went on for months and finally, due to an impasse in disputing the unauthorized charges that were unresolved, the account was charged off. I have since made a number of attempts to dispute the transactions with the issuer while have retained legal counsel to advise on a settlement ( for the charges that I authorized in the amount of {$4100.00} ) which was finally granted. With the new payment amount agreed to, the company associate also agreed to remove the fraud-ravaged account once I completed the required payment."

Wells Fargo responded on XX/XX/2021, stating that the company sent them a document stating that it was a one-time fee, despite me sending documentation showing otherwise. Wells Fargo said that it would take them a month to send me the other side 's documents, as I requested to see the false documentation, but I never received anything.

5649,"On XX/XX/2022 I was scammed and the scammers gained access to my online Wells Fargo banking account including my checking, savings and credit card accounts. I went to my local bank and they told me to go home and call the Fraud line which I did. The agent closed my checking and savings accounts and transferred my funds to new accounts. At that time the agent didn't tell me that my credit card might also be vulnerable. He did tell me that the wire transfer from my checking account did not go though so I assumed I was safe. 
On XX/XX/2022 I saw XXXX XXXX at my local Wells Fargo and she told me again that the wire transfer hadn't gone through. She also said there was no activity on my credit card. Later on the XXXX, I checked my online accounts and discovered a cash advance taken on my credit card of {$9900.00} plus a {$490.00} cash advance fee. I immediately called the Fraud line to alert them to the illegal activity on my account and the account was closed but the wire transfer had already gone through even though this cash advance was in excess of my daily limit. I have not used this card in years and I have never gotten a cash advance so I believe that Wells Fargo should have prevented or at least alerted me that this was happening. 
On XX/XX/2022 I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that the case was closed and the money could not be recovered so I was responsible to pay the cash advance, plus the cash advance fee, plus a {$64.00} interest charge for a total of {$10000.00}. I subsequently received a credit card statement from Wells Fargo for that amount.

They said they would need to get into my computer to clear it up and with one small step they were in. they said it would take some time to do the work and to step away and not worry but to leave the computer on and they would callme back the next day. The next morning they called to tell me they still had some work to do and to inform me I was selected for a free upgrade and a refund of my payment I had recently made. i was then taken to a page where I was to fill in my name and the amount to refund which was {$300.00}. I did that and then a screen came up which showed {$15000.00} in my checking account which they said was theirs and I would have to pay them back. I said I didn't know how that got there and they said I had to have done it when I put in the refund amount and now I would need to do a wire transfer for that amount. I now became suspicious and told the man I was not comfortable with all this and he told me if I did not comply he would take the money from my IRA accounts as well and then showed a page where they were zerod out. I was now concerned that I may lose all my money and so I had to go on with the transfer. He did all the work on that and told me what to say to the tranfer agent to initiate it. Then I told the scammer I had to leave for an emergency and would be right back at which time I called the Wells Fargo fraud line and explained what I was in the middle of and that I was really concerned. the agent told me he had all he needed after I gave him all the details but did not offer any advice or help on what I should do next so I figured everything would be OK. I got back to the scammer and the transfer was finished. what was puzzeling to me was the transfer agent did not seem to find it odd that I was transfering {$15000.00} to a bank in XXXX when I had never before done a tranfer at at and to person there for a wedding gift and I could not pronounce her name properly. All the while the scammer was telling me what to say. he then said to just leave the computer on and he would get back to me in the morning. The next morning when he did not call and I checked my accounts my credit card was maxed out and my on hand cash was gone totaling almost {$23000.00}. I called the Wells Fargo fraud line again and told them what had happened and they said they would do an investigation to which I just received the result as not their fault and I would have to pay back the credit card balance of {$18000.00}."

5657,"I bought a hvac system on credit at 0 % interest. I set up automatic payments. These began and started going through. This month on XX/XX/XXXX my wife told me that the WellsFargo account didn't get paid. I called as it was on automatic payments. 
The customer service agent told me I called and cancelled the automatic payments on XX/XX/XXXX. I didn't not. After WellsFargo attempted to retrieve the call logs I was informed that I cancelled the automatic payments online. I did not. 

When an automatic billing is cancelled an email is generated automatically and sent to the consumer. There is no record of this on the XX/XX/XXXX. I have another card that I cancelled today XX/XX/XXXX to see if it did email me and the automatic system did. 

This could be either a one-off technical glitch within Wells Fargo 's system or it could be a systemic method of bilking customers of interest on 0 % interest credit cards. 

I didn't cancel the automatic payments, and being a paralyzed 100 % service connected veteran I believe that what Wells Fargo is doing is reprehensible.

I called to find out what was going on and they said the payment had to be held for 4 days and would be added to the card on Sunday XX/XX/XXXX. Looked at the card and it was still not added. I then called again and was given the run around again. Wells Fargo is scamming customers not letting them use their cards and holding the payments made because we refuse to bank with Wells Fargo. Why would a bank with such a dysfunctional bank?

I have made a dozen calls and complained. I have also complained with their  executive appeals office. However, during my first 3 months with this credit card, Wells Fargo increase their offer to {$200.00} ( with the same requirements ). I am filing a complaint because Fargo  has not been ethical and honest with me at all and have never responded to my dozen or so calls to fix their error."

The bartender kept the card to keep a tab open. My daughter left the bar around XXXX without ordering any more drinks, and she forgot to pick up her card. Someone ( bartender? customer at the bar? bar owner? ) charged {$1100.00} to this card at XXXX. The tab was closed out the next day, XX/XX/2021 with a forged signature. We contacted Wells Fargo when the charge showed up, and they advised XXXX not to close the account, and that they'd take care of it. We followed their advice. They removed the charge for a period of time, then put it back on, without notifying us. We finally decided on our own that the best course of action was to report this fraud to the police in XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX where XXXX is located ), and they took a report and are still investigating this crime. I've spent over 20 hours talking to Wells Fargo about this, without satisfactory results. This is a clear case of fraud, with an open police investigation, and a clearly forged signature. My daughter also forwarded time-stamped photos and a taxi receipt to Wells Fargo to prove she wasn't at XXXX when the tab was closed out. I've repeatedly asked Wells Fargo to explain why they won't remove it, and they keep saying it's because there's a signed charge slip. I've had fraud removed from my other cards when there was a signed charge slip, and this signature is forged, so I'm not buying their explanation."
5677,"On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo added a false charge of {$2100.00} onto my credit card account. They claimed it was a balance transfer because I cancelled my credit card for that account but the balance they claim was transferred is not money I ever owed. 
I already had a balance on my account of {$5000.00} for charges I made and the only reason I cancelled my Wells Fargo credit card was because of fraud and I ordered a new credit card and then Wells Fargo added a {$2100.00} extra charge onto my account and I dont even understand where that charge came from and it is not money that I owe. I called Wells Fargo and asked them to go through all of my charges with me on the phone and to tell me where the extra {$2100.00} charge came from and they couldnt even explain it to me. They just repeatedly said it was a balance transfer from the credit card you had replaced. Which makes absolutely zero sense because I have replaced my Wells Fargo credit card many times this past year due to fraud and I never had a random charge on my same credit card statement called balance transfer. 
I have added up every charge on my statement and all of the payments I have made in the past few months and this bogus {$2100.00} balance transfer charge is fake and Wells Fargo can not explain to me where that charge even came from. 

Here are all of the payments I have made on my Wells Fargo credit card balance since XX/XX/XXXX when I had a XXXX balance on the credit card. 
XX/XX/XXXX - {$2800.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$2000.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$1000.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$2000.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$1500.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$2100.00} XX/XX/XXXX - {$100.00} Since the time my balance was at {$0.00} on my credit card statement, if you add up all of my charges and then subtract the payments I have made on my credit card, this balance transfer charge of {$2100.00} came out of now where and is fake and Wells Fargo is trying to steal money from me with a bogus charge."

One at the time of ordering XX/XX/XXXX, one at the time of the products being made XX/XX/XXXX, and one at the time of installation XX/XX/XXXX. I recently noticed on the bill that there is no breakdown of how the monthly payments, {$490.00} are broken down over the installments. I called Wells Fargo to inquire at how the payments are broken down and was told there is a minimum payment calculation on all 3 installments which make the {$490.00}. I am currently paying {$1000.00} a month and I asked how the principle was being impacted by the overpayment. I was told that anything over the minimum payment would go to the first expiring installment. I asked how the minimum payment is calculated/allocated to each promotion as I want to ensure the installments will be paid in full prior to the promotional financing expiring to avoid the interest charges. I was told by the representative that they can not explain that, but the payments are applied at the companys discretion. I asked if the over payment can be allocated to ensure the promotions are paid in full prior to the expiration dates and was told that payments can not be allocated. I followed up with another call the following day to ask again how the payments were calculated to ensure they were paid in full prior to the expiration dates and was told that no one would be able to provide that information. At this point I requested an escalation as I am concerned that my payments will not be applied properly since there is no clarity on the process and my promotions will not be paid off in time. After speaking with a manager and explaining that I would be filing a CFPB complaint since I can not get a simple answer to my question, I was told an escalation would be submitted and I would get my answer within 10 business day. After this period I received a letter with the terms and conditions and a letter explaining how the payment is calculated but still did not answer how the minimum payments are allocated to ensure the promotions are paid off prior to the final due date."
5716,I had to get a XXXX done a XXXX to be exact due to XXXX XXXX  the procedure happen on XX/XX/2022 and wells fargo didn't give me any hardship for my credit card payments forbearance for not making my credit card payments i explained to them that my XXXX  was 8 weeks and they didn't care and reported my credit card payments late i attached my XXXX documents below
5723,"I received a letter from Wells Fargo informing me I had applied for a credit card. I did not apply for a credit card. I called Wells Fargo and spoke with several representatives. I asked only that they not issue any card in my name. Instead, they sent me a letter telling me if I did not send them a notarized declaration that they would open the account. 

I have put fraud alerts on all three credit services. I have contacted 4 other banks/companies who also received applications in my name. They all froze the accounts or told me they would not issue the cards.

I believe Wells Fargo has a financial interest in opening as many accounts as possible, and this may very well be a scam in which they open accounts without the consent of the consumer. 

Thank you for whatever help you can offer."
5728,"Hello I have a Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX  since XXXX. There was a fraud transaction on my card through online cash advance transfer in XX/XX/XXXX. I am a victim of the Identity Theft since XX/XX/XXXX. Multiple incidences happened with different banks ( e.g. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXXetc ), but all resolved except with Wells Fargo bank. I filled claims multiple times, however I received XXXX letters regarding the fraud, the first letter mentioned that the case was denied and another letter, mentioned "" found that no fraud occurred, or the transaction were authorized ''. I was a victim of identity theft, and the charges were made without my authorization. I should not be responsible for fraudulent changes of which was not authorized by me. Wells Fargo bank should be fully responsible for this as they are the one who approved an unauthorized checking account at first place. 

I would like to summarize what was happened : 1. On XX/XX/XXXX, an internet scam hacker had stolen my personal information, opened a Wells Fargo "" Everyday Checking '' account ending in XXXX with my social security number and birthdate. The address was in XXXX NY where I had never lived. The NY driver 's license was also not mine as I have been living in XXXX  for the past XXXX  years and before that lived in XXXX  for XXXX  years. The account has been approved by Wells Fargo bank without my authorization. This account has been later determined to be unauthorized by Wells Fargo and confirmed that I have no financial liability for this account. 

2. The hacker used my Wells Fargo Visa card ( ending with XXXX ), transferred {$4000.00} from my credit card to the newly opened checking account ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX, then use ATM card to withdraw the money. 

XXXX. When I got my credit card bill in XXXX, I was incredibly surprised because I hadn't used the Well Fargo credit card in a long time, and it was clearly a credit card fraud. I immediately went to the bank to explain the situation and declared that it was a fraud. The Wells Fargo XXXX PA branch service staff agreed to file and report it to the relevant departments. To avoid fraud, I immediately asked to cancel the credit card. A month later, I received a letter from Wells Fargo, admitting that the account opening was a fraud, and I was not responsible for it. But soon Wells Fargo sent a new credit card, the number ( XXXX ) was different from the original card, I thought the bank made a mistake, because I have declared to the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX to cancel this card, and not necessary to issue a new card, because it is not safety. I XXXX ' t want keeping it, so I cut and throw out. 

XXXX. A couple of days later I got a new credit card bill to pay Wells Fargo of {$4000.00}, I was really confused, so I went to XXXX XXXX again, the Bank XXXX told me not to pay the bill as the investigation is still ongoing. 

XXXX. During this period, I have received XXXX of the investigation letters, it stated that the inquiry about charges to my account in the amount of {$4000.00} determined to be unauthorized. I thought the situation is resolved, however, it is not as I expected, the monthly bill keeping received and adding the late fee and interest, by XX/XX/XXXX, it is cumulative up to {$5100.00}. And at last, I receive a letter from XXXX collector company and asking me to pay this amount of money by end of XXXX. 

XXXX. I called Wells Fargo multiple times since XX/XX/XXXX, on average every XXXX weeks, every time, it took me about XXXX hours, it kept transferring to the different departments, it seems that no one could make decision, and nobody know how to address the issue. For a company that mentions the term XXXX Liability in reference to fraud charges more than XXXX times on the website, I feel I was treated incredibly unfairly and pretty far from what I would expect from any customer service. Throughout the entire process, I felt like I was working with a third party outsourced call center with XXXX accountability to Wells Fargo customers. I never spoke to the same person twice and was unable to reach any individual to whom I had previously spoken to about my case. 

XXXX. To further approve my point, the deny letter mentioned "" our research of this claim shows that the funds from the online transfer listed below were used via debit card purchases and electronic debits '', but since the checking account XXXX is already confirmed to be unauthorized, it is clear that any online tractions related to the account should be unauthorized as well, I feel it is clear enough, but apparently it is not clear to the XXXX. 

At end I would like to emphasize that I was a victim of identity theft, and the charges were made without my authorization. I should not be responsible for fraudulent changes of which I had not authorized. Wells Fargo bank should be fully responsible for this. The main issue is that Wells Fargo approved the checking account ( XXXX ) without my authorization, this is the cause of all the post fraudulent activities. It seems that there is a loophole in their security alert system. The loss and unwarranted pressure of customers due to the bank 's negligence and irresponsibility are unacceptable. The event initiated in XX/XX/XXXX, almost 10 months passed, the situation is still not resolved by Wells Fargo which is ridiculous."
5730,"This dispute is involving XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A ( Wells Fargo ). 

On XXXX XX/XX/2022, I was approved for a balance transfer totaling {$5000.00} from Wells Fargo. The {$5000.00} was supposed to be paid to my XXXX Credit Card balance. The total balance for my XXXX Credit Card was just over {$10000.00} when this balance transfer was approved. On XXXX XX/XX/2022, I received my Wells Fargo XXXX credit card in the mail with the outstanding balance of {$4900.00}. Fast forward to today 's date, XXXX XX/XX/2022, the balance for my XXXX XXXX has not reflected the payoff amount that was supposed to come from Wells Fargo and still holds the {$10000.00} balance. 

I contacted a representative from Wells Fargo customer service team and was told that the funds were electronically deposited into a XXXX XXXX XXXX account for {$5000.00} on XXXX XX/XX/2022. I do not have an auto loan with XXXX so I called XXXX XXXX  customer service and was told that there is no Auto Loan account with my information and that they have not received any funds from Wells Fargo. I then contacted Wells Fargo again and spoke to another rep. After explaining my situation again, this time I was told that this issue will be looked into and I will hear back from a service agent within 90 days. When asked for a dispute number that I can reference, I was told that there was not one and that there will be a note in my file. How do I truly know that my situation is being worked on if there is no way to reference my issue? 

XXXX XXXX  is denying to have the funds, while Wells Fargo is adamant that the funds were successfully deposited. In the meantime, I am responsible for making payments for an extra {$5000.00} that I never received, in addition to taking the hit on my credit score due to an extra {$5000.00} balance that popped up."
5732,"Wells Fargo is restricting the number of payments I can make from a non-Wells Fargo account. I've tried reaching out to them multiple times and they just keep stalling. I've tried to pay this account in full MULTIPLE times now but just keep getting the following message. In short, they're attempting to force me into creating a bank account with them just to pay this card which I have zero interest in doing. 

"" You have reached the daily or monthly limit for the number of online payments to this account ( s ) made from a non-Wells Fargo account. Please make this payment using a Wells Fargo account or call XXXX to make this payment."
5734,"I applied for a credit card with a balance transfer feature in XXXX XXXX. I received the card a couple of weeks later. I did not activate the card, because i was not going to use it for a while. On XX/XX/XXXX I reported fraudulent activity to the bank. There was a balance transfer for {$5400.00} to a company that I have never heard of or done any business with them and very obviously not done by me. Contacted the bank on XX/XX/XXXX and explained that it was a completely fraudulent transaction again and they promised a resolution by XX/XX/XXXX and told me this would be covered under their fraud protection program. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter claiming that there was no fraud. That claim is incorrect and impossible. I have never done business with the company that actually received the money, nor do I have any knowledge of the existence of that company. And more importantly the company that they say I owed money to is not listed on my credit report. 
The only way I found out about this problem was when I checked my credit and saw that there was a balance on a card I had never used."
5737,"I switched credit cards with Wells Fargo from the cash wise card to the active cash card on XX/XX/XXXX. I called customer service to confirm that I would be eligible for the {$200.00} sign on bonus for spending {$1000.00} in the first 3 months, even though I was switching my credit card and not signing up for a new one. They confirmed that I would still be eligible. I called again after my card arrived, expressing my concern that the progress for my reward was not being tracked on the website, and I was told that it would show once I met the {$1000.00} threshold. I met the threshold in XX/XX/XXXX, and called again since the bonus had not showed. I was told a case specialist would be working with me. He later called me on XX/XX/XXXX telling me that it was on record that the operator told me I would be eligible, but I was lied to, and that there was nothing they could do to get me the bonus."
5738,"My dispute is with a Wells Fargo ( WF ) credit card. I established my WF account when I was XXXX XXXX XXXX and was a customer for nearly 8 years without complaint. In XX/XX/2020 I went in to a local branch in XXXX, FL with the intention of canceling my credit card with WF. I paid approximately XXXX dollars to close the account out with a XXXX dollar balance and closed both my checking and saving account and moved my primary credit card over to XXXX XXXX. About 8 months later, an apartment renter 's insurance company charged my WF card for about XXXX dollars for yearly renters insurance. I was assured that my WF card was closed when I went in originally in XXXX and as such, WF should not have been able to process the charge 8 months later.

Now, nearly a year and a half later I am still getting charged for this fraudulent use of my card for which the account was closed out in full and should not have been able to be charged in the first place. this has ruined my credit score, my other credit accounts have had their credit limits reduced due to this mistake and I am continuously being harassed to pay back WF over XXXX dollars in late fees. I have tried reaching out to WF multiple times and they have not resolved this issue. This is affecting my life years later and I demand that my credit score be restored to its original score in the 720+ range."
5743,Wells Fargo offered me a balance transfer. I accepted this and created an online transfer to XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$2600.00}. I have the Wells Fargo e-mail confirmation dated XX/XX/XXXX. I received a fraud alert on Monday XXXX for a {$5300.00} charge. I called the fraud Dept. Told them what I was doing on XXXX. I was told this had been entered twice by mistake. I was told they would fix the issue and get this transfer done. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX as I had not seen the transaction. I was told both were cancelled. I told them this was incorrect. They got me with another rep and I went through the whole transfer process on the phone. I called to check early tue following week and was told the transaction hadnt posted yet. I called back on XXXXas the transaction still had not occurred. I was passed off yet again to their complaint Dept. This lady sent me an e-mail XXXX XXXX is her name. I replied to her e-mail and told her this could still be corrected until XX/XX/XXXX. I received a call from XXXX XXXX and she told me about an e-mail she was sending. This e-mail was not going to correct the situation I requested on multiple times on hold to speak with a Supervisor. I was never given a Supervisor. She finally agreed to try and process the transfer. I told her I wanted a transcript of our entire phone call. She said I could send the interest charges that would accrue because if their failure to her and she would get it taken care of. She again had trouble with the request. She said she would call me back after she talked with someone else. I have yet to receive this callback. I am completely frustrated and angry at Wells Fargo. I gave them over 3 weeks to get a simple balance transfer completed and it still has not happened. I have never in XXXX  years had such a terrible experience with a bank.

On approximately XX/XX/XXXX XXXX I notified the company that the items was delivered with extensive damage to the box it came in. I wanted to return it. First they said it would charge me $ XXXX then they apologized and said they would take it back for free. 
I filed a dispute with my credit card company- Wells Fargo . I have called them twice ( once per chat box ), and have emailed them pictures, etc. Today it is XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I still have NO provisional credit for the charge- and I'm being charged interest on the entire balance including the disputed amount! I do not feel that is fair. I don't know if that's even legal but they're doing it. The other charge was for {$50.00} for a subscription that renewed automatically. I contacted the merchant to cancel my order- in fact I have sent 2 emails and they don't even respond. I also disputed that with Wells Fargo- and have NO provisional credit and am also being charged for the FULL finance charges."
5749,"This is a follow-up to complaint # XXXX, as CFPB closed the case, which no longer allowed me to respond or add anything. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX from Wells Fargo responded promising "" Monetary Relief '' as a courtesy of {$10.00}, with no explanation of how I would receive that or a timetable in which to expect it. I hereby reject that courtesy credit, as I was told my purchases didn't qualify, which is FALSE. Their claim was that "" XXXX XXXX only had some of their locations listed as part of their promotion ; the location I visited was not listed '' and "" XXXX XXXX does not qualify as part of the promotion ''. 

The terms of this "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX '' promotion gave a website "" XXXX '' that lists participating businesses, that is where I found these 2 restaurants before patronizing them. I will be uploading screenshots to this case from that site, showing the "" XXXX XXXX '' emblem next to the address of the exact locations I made purchases from, taken the same day the purchases were made. Also, those same businesses CAN STILL BE FOUND as participating in this promotion on that web site, RIGHT NOW. 

Also included will be a screenshot of my credit card statement showing both entries, to identify them as the proper locations, and to show that I have not yet been credited properly for this promotion. XXXX XXXX purchase was {$14.00}, XXXX XXXX was {$11.00}, both purchases were made on XX/XX/XXXX. 

And finally, a screenshot of the promotion 's terms showing the aforementioned web site for finding participating businesses will also be included.

5756,"I fell victim to a credit card scam on XX/XX/22. I had just started a new job the week prior, and I got a text from someone purporting to be my boss asking me to go get gift cards for a presentation, that he was in a meeting so he couldn't talk, and I would be reimbursed by my employer. Because he was using them for a presentation, he needed me to send him pictures of the gift cards. He made the request sound very urgent. Without a second thought I was on my way to purchase these gift cards, I didn't want to make a bad impression on my boss. First, I went to XXXX XXXX and purchased {$600.00} for XXXX XXXX ( XXXX {$500.00}, XXXX  {$100.00} purchase ) and {$600.00} for XXXX ( XXXX {$500.00}, XXXX  {$100.00} purchase ). XXXX XXXX total : {$1200.00}. I started to get suspicious when he asked me to go to a second store. He would always text back really fast or repeat text if I didn't answer immediately, not giving me a moment to think. I went to XXXX and got {$800.00} for XXXX ( XXXX {$200.00}, XXXX {$100.00} ). He wanted me to get more from the XXXX, but the system locked me out. XXXX total : {$800.00}. Thats when I fully realized it was a scam. He wanted me to go to a third store. that's when I called the office and confirmed I was not texting with my boss. I told him I couldn't get more and needed to get back to the office, he was insisting I get {$200.00} more. As soon as I got back to work, I disputed the transactions with the bank and made a police report. Since I was still communicating with the person via text, I called the Police 's nonemergency line, but it wasn't being staffed. I filed a report online. I called the number I was texting but it was a XXXX number. Grand total : {$2000.00}. 

Wells Fargo is holding me responsible for the {$2000.00} that was stolen from me because I was a victim of a gift card scam. They "" can not '' do anything because the merchants denied the dispute because I made the purchases, and because there are no funds left on the gift cards. Of course there are no funds left, it's a SCAM."

5759,"In late XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo had a great offer on balance transfers. I completed and then submitted my application. My request was approved but not for the full amount of the requested balance transfer. What they did approve was sent to one of my creditors in XX/XX/XXXX. The company sent {$980.00} to an account with an $ 18K+ balance. This action, of course, did nothing to help my debt situation as that specific credit card debt was not remotely resolved and I, now, owed Wells Fargo as well. 

In mid-XXXX XXXX  I called Wells Fargo, explained the situation to them and asked them to reverse the transaction as it made my debt situation worse. The first representative XXXX XXXX  could not assist with my request, so he connected me with a gentleman named XXXX ' in Escalation Services. I spoke with XXXX and told him the situation and my concerns, and he agreed that the transfer was not productive for my objective. He told me I needed to contact the receiving credit card company and have them cancel the transaction. He further advised I call back once Id done that, and Wells Fargo would reverse the charge for the balance transfer fee. 

In early XXXX, I spoke with the receiving credit card company and explained my situation. The company informed me that it was unable to cancel the transaction and I would have to speak with the issuing company, Wells Fargo. The company 's representative further informed me that once the transaction posted, in this case the day of arrival, there was no way to cancel or send it back. 

In XXXX, I called Wells Fargo and spoke with a representative. After explaining my situation, yet again, the individual proceeded to tell me they sent the amount I requested. This made no sense to me as I have owed a substantial amount on this credit card for quite some time. The only way this could have happened is if I had inadvertently left a digit out of the amount. I am not saying this is impossible, but I have doubt that I did that. At any rate, I asked if it was still possible to overturn the transaction, regardless of whose error it was. The representative, then, told me the transaction could not be reversed as the timeline for this to occur had already passed. I, then, asked if Wells Fargo would at least reverse the balance transfer fee. To which the representative replied That, I cant do. My final response was something to the effect of being XXXX  over, all around, as Wells Fargo was unwilling to provide any financial relief. 

The most distressing issues, for me, are : The fact that the first representative, who advised me to contact the receiving company, did not tell me there was a deadline or timeline for the transaction reversal Potentially, Wells Fargo could have resolved my issue during my first round of calls had the representative taken care of it at that time instead of directing me to call the receiving creditor Whether it was my mistake or the companys, their unwillingness to offer any form of financial relief is unsatisfactory customer service and concern The incident has lowered my credit score because the amount transferred is almost equivalent to the credit balance of the card, thus leaving the card at 74 % usage and lowering the receiving card by only 5 %. Therefore, this requested action to raise my credit score resulted in the exact opposite action.

However it was missing my middle name, in which I always use. all of this took plavce the week of XX/XX/XXXX. I also had a bank account open with the same information in XX/XX/XXXX with Wells Fargo. They wouldn't confirm or deny if they were the leak of my information. The reason I think that they are responsible for the breach is because in XXXX we opened a bank account with Wells Fargo and realized 2 days later are information was used to try and get a loan with Wells Fargo and wasn't on our credit score? That was a red flag. We closed the Wells Fargo account that day. It never showed up on our credit score so we thought it was someone trying to trick us and we stopped it.

5765,"On XX/XX/XXXX of 2021, I called in and spoke with a rep from the Wells Fargo Credit Card department. She assisted me with a balance transfer from the Wells Fargo credit card to my XXXX credit card. I wanted to pay off the balance due which was {$500.00}. I gave her the number on my XXXX credit card. She said everything was completed. 
In XXXX of 2021 I received a late fee from XXXX in the amount of {$35.00}. They NEVER received the funds. 
I immediately called Wells Fargo and the next rep from the credit card department said they have no idea where those funds went, but since they literally vanished into thin air, they will be returned back onto my card within XXXX billing cycles. 
I called in several times between XXXX and XXXX and they had no record of anything being looked into. Finally, things were escalated and I receive a letter stating Wells Fargo does not give refunds, so if I want my money back I would have to contact the XXXX directly. 
I reached out to the corporate office in XXXX. They said they would look into it and on XX/XX/XXXX I received yet another email stating I needed to contact the "" payee '' ( XXXX ) to get my money back. 
Everyone at Wells Fargo is ignoring the FACT I have proof XXXX never received the payment! Am I to sound like a crazy person calling XXXX and demanding funds back they simply don't have? 
The first rep made a mistake. It's her job to know the requirements for a money transfer. If something didn't look right, if they make mistakes, if it didn't fit some criteria, it is Wells Fargo 's responsibility to make it right. I made several transfers, all through reps, within the first 90 days as the card allowed... This is the only one that went awry. 
They are asking me to pay on BOTH accounts totaling {$1100.00}!! I STILL had to pay express a separate {$500.00} which I did in increments ... AND the {$500.00} to Wells Fargo for the failed transfer. 
Wells Fargo keeps sending me "" proof '' on their end that they processed my request BUT I have proof XXXX never received those funds! 
This is a million/billion dollar company who isn't taking responsibility. I am a single mom who is being punished for the Wells Fargo representatives error. I was promised in XXXX of 2021 I would receive the funds back. I simply want Wells Fargo to honor what they told me.

Wells Fargo employees were challenged to open as many accounts as they could and rewards were paid supposedly. I have read that management at WF told these lower ranking employees how to aggressively open these accounts and this went on for years. I tried to no avail back in 2006 ( I think ) to have something done about this young man who did this to me. I went into the XXXX, CA branch and he ran away when he saw me. I complained to several management staff and even received a call one evening from an extremely rude and arrogant man who told me basically to shut up because non of his employees would ever do something like I had described.I was one of those people and it occurred years ago in XXXX Ca. and I tried repeatedly and for months when it happened to have something done about the young man that had harassed me while I sat at his desk using his phone to get my lock out service to come to unlock my car. This bank employee would not stop telling me that I needed to get a {$2000.00} personal loan type credit card. I was appalled at how rude and aggressive he was. He continued to talk to me non stop. I looked him in the eye and said "" Listen, the last thing in the world I need right now is another credit card. Please leave me alone! A few days later my son and I boarded a beautiful cruise ship. I decided to check my bank account and was horrified at what I saw. The man I had met in the XXXX, CA Wells Fargo had gone ahead, against my wishes, and ordered the personal loan type of credit card. This just about ruined my entire trip. Now I had to deal with this while on vacation. So I contacted the bank and told them I wanted a copy of the application that I had supposedly filled out. When I received the copy that had all the info typed in from a computer, where the signature should have been, it read "" no signature required. '' He had accessed my personal information and used it to order this card. It cost me fees as fees are charged when you get cash advances and I did not but he ( the bank employee ) had already processed several and then transferred those cash advances to my checking. A few months ago I received a check for $ XXXX from XXXX XXXX , Senior Vice President, Customer Remediation Office , Wells Fargo , XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, OR XXXX.I was utterly appalled. How rude and how dishonest and it is identity theft! I wish I could do something about this. It is a slap in the face. It was a horrible experience and quite stressful. How dare they insult me by sending me a check for {$1.00} and then writing another letter weeks later wanting to know why I had not cashed my check!! I would like to know how many, of the thousands they defrauded, are happy with their so called settlement. It is unfair and so UNAMERICAN how Wells Fargo was allowed to just brush these types of actions under their carpet."
5767,"I had closed the Wells Fargo account and confirmed with them that there was not a balance. I found out two months later that they reported me late. I have never been late with them, nor with anyone else for that matter so this reporting is unjust. They admitted that it was their fault and after trying to resolve it with them again after-the-fact, it still goes unchanged on my credit report."
5768,"On XX/XX/XXXX my credit card was charged for the full amount instead of the monthly installments that were set up. This was a mistake on my behalf and I reached out to Wells Fargo to get it reversed. 

They told me that it can take up to 11 business days to get my money back. 

Today is XX/XX/XXXX and I still have not received my funds of over {$3000.00}. 

Ever time I call they give me the runaround, and refuse to tell me when Im getting my money."
5769,"I paid the full balance of the credit card in question on XX/XX/2022 for an amount of {$1200.00}. The transactions was reversed. The XXXX  Rewards app does not have the option to view or change the account number that is being used to pay the card. So I assumed I had entered it incorrectly. I then added the checking account and routing number again to pay the card and copied and pasted directly from XXXX bank App and triple checked the information. I then attempted to pay the balance again on XX/XX/2022 for {$1200.00} and the transaction was reversed again a few days later. They charged me interest for late payment and then closed my account. They cited suspicious activity for the reason my account was closed but they would not confirm with me account information they had on file. They would not read it back to me. 

I opened a complaint but the complaint was not resolved in my favor. 

I attempted a third time to pay over the phone and currently am waiting the outcome."
5771,I was contacted my a XXXX agent in the beginning of XX/XX/2022 stating that my personal information had been stolen and used to open countless credit cards. with charges racked up on XXXX ( was contacted by them too ). I have a Federal Trade Commission agent and number that was giving to me. I wasnt sure if it was authenthic or fraudulent also. I was then contacted again mid XXXX 2022 about more credit cards being found in my name at the border of XXXX and Texas.
5773,"I canceled my Wells Fargo credit card as well as Wells Fargo savings and checking accounts due to their fraudulent accounts scandal in XX/XX/XXXX. 

Paid off credit card balance with money deducted from checking or savings account. Received a letter from Wells Fargo showing XXXX balance and card had been canceled. 

Subsequently received a letter from Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX that I still owed money. Went to Wells Fargo Bank to resolve. There had been an issue with the money being deducted from account because account had been closed before money had been credited to credit card bill. This is despite receiving the previously mentioned letter showing {$0.00} balance. 

Went to Wells Fargo Bank on XX/XX/XXXX. Spoke to "" XXXX '' on phone. We paid the {$27.00} principal amount that had not been deducted properly from the closed account. Then spoke with "" XXXX '' from the escalation department. XXXX confirmed that all fees and interest charges were waived. Confirmation # XXXX. Was assured that the matter was resolved. 

Received a letter from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/XXXX that we had a past due amount on subject credit card.

Went to Wells Fargo bank again on XX/XX/XXXX. Spoke on phone to "" XXXX. '' Was assured again that the problem would be taken care of, it was a bank error, and waived all charges and was told the account was indeed closed with a {$0.00} balance. Confirmation # XXXX. Heard nothing further from Wells Fargo. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we received another letter from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/XXXX that we have a balance of {$150.00} immediately due and "" Due to the serious delinquency on your payment, we have exercised our right to accelerate the balance. We 've also reported your account to the consumer reporting agencies as "" unpaid balance reported as a loss ( charge-off ) by credit grantor. '' Returned to Wells Fargo bank on XX/XX/XXXX to speak to them again. Spoke to XXXX XXXX Collections and described issue once again. They agreed to waive all charges and fees and will contact credit bureaus but it could take 30-90 days to be resolved. I requested confirmation be provided that these actions were being taken. I was told by "" XXXX '' that his system would n't allow him to send me any confirmation and that I would "" just have to trust him. '' I requested to speak to a manager. 

Was referred to the Executive Office. Spoke to XXXX XXXX and was told that a case file had been opened to resolve this issue but it could take up to 10 days. Requested to talk to a manager above her. Was referred to "" XXXX '' who explained the process to me once again. I told her that I did not trust Wells Fargo 's "" processes '' to resolve the issue because I had been assured twice before that the issue had been resolved. I requested to speak to her manager. I was forwarded to her supervisor, "" XXXX, '' waited on the phone for probably 30 minutes then Wells Fargo hung up on us. "" XXXX '' is supposed to call me but has not as of yet. 

I have been harmed because of mistakes caused by Wells Fargo and their reporting their mistake to the credit bureaus. I received assurances once again from the Executive Office that the problem would be resolved, but I have no confidence that it will be satisfactorily resolved based on previous poor performance by Wells Fargo. 

What can I do further to hold Wells Fargo accountable for their mistakes, and what penalty should they incur for the harm caused to me for their errors?"
5775,"Wells Fargo had a major service outage in XXXX of XXXX. I have been unable to access my Wells Fargo online account since that time. 

All of my statements were previously received exclusively through Wells Fargo online, which I am unable to access since XXXX of XXXX. 

I switched to another bank in XXXX of XXXX, because Wells Fargo was unable to help me re-establish access. This was after speaking with several people via telephone and in-person. 

I kept my credit card open, because it was my oldest card. But I stopped using it, because I was no longer receiving statements. 

In XXXX of XXXX, Wells Fargo reporting me to the credit bureaus for non-payment. This was surprising, because I had not been using my credit card. And, Wells Fargo made no attempt to contact me before ruining my credit. 

The charges were obviously fraudulent, because I had not been using my Wells Fargo credit card. I reported the charges to Wells Fargo, and they agreed to remove them. I have a letter in writing where they agreed to this. 

Wells Fargo reported me again in XXXX of XXXX. Apparently, they never removed the charges like they said they would. Credit score drops again... 

I still don't have any statements. Don't have any idea what these charges are. Or who made them. 

I visited a branch in XXXX of XXXX. They said they were going to open an "" executive case '' or something. I've never heard anything. 

I blindly started sending money to Wells Fargo in XXXX of XXXX. I didn't want them to ruin my credit again. Apparently, I got everything paid off during this time. Although, I still didn't have any statements. 

I talked to someone on the telephone in XXXX of XXXX. Very rude and unhelpful. Completely denied Wells Fargo 's role in this fiasco. 

I started submitting complaints, letters, and disputes to various agencies. Trying to find someone who would help. 

In XXXX of XXXX, I received a XXXX  package. It had statements for my credit card account. But, not my checking account. I was able to verify that all of the credit card charges were fraudulent, and not initiated by me. I sent a letter to Wells Fargo, again asking them to remove these charges -- like they originally agreed to do in XXXX of XXXX. 

It also contained a letter claiming that there's records of me accessing Wells Fargo online. This is a little infuriating. I am still unable to login to Wells Fargo online. I suspect that their records are incorrect, or that they are incompetent. Or maybe, they just don't want to admit what's been going on."
5778,"1 ) On XX/XX/2022, I boarded the XXXX XXXX XXXX providing XXXX my XXXX XXXX card for incidentals. 

2 ) On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, a total of {$29000.00} was charged to my card, most of which went to the XXXX XXXX cruise line in XXXX, Florida. Being at sea, I didn't detect this until I arrived home on XX/XX/XXXX, at which time I cancelled my card with Wells-Fargo bank. 

3 ) My final statement from XXXX did not include these charges and I have no way of knowing whether these were made from the ship. I contacted XXXX XXXX and they denied that any cruises were booked in my name or paid with my credit card. 

4 ) Wells-Fargo investigated and concluded that, by giving my card to XXXX, XXXX had authorized these charges and am therefore responsible for them. This is consistent with the policy on the CFPB website : "" if you give your card to someone to use, you have authorized the use. If the person uses the card for a different purpose, that may still be considered an authorized use. You would still be responsible for the charge, until you notify your card issuer that the person is no longer authorized to use the card. '' 5 ) I can't stay in a hotel, or go on a cruise ship, without providing a credit card. How can I be responsible for rogue charges such as this? This $ XXXX was almost double the credit limit on my card so a lower limit wouldn't have helped in this case."
5779,"I have charges on the account that are not mine. I spoke with credit card company WellsFargo, and told them I have never made them charges. My credit limit is only XXXX, and WellsFargo says I owe them XXXX."
5780,"On XX/XX/XXXX a Charge from XXXX XXXX was charged on my account fraudulently. I report the fraud and my bank will not reverse the charge. I have attempted to reach XXXX XXXX, unfortunately they are no longer operational. I have been attempting to resolve this with both the bank and the company since XX/XX/2021. I have XXXX worth of NSF 's on 2 separate accounts relating to this claim."
5783,"Wells Fargo sent my statement late, I paid the bill, and then they sent me another statement with a {$29.00} late fee and {$19.00} in interest on {$770.00} bill I paid in full that arrived seven days late. I called to request they waive the fee and interest and they declined. Given their history of creating false accounts and charging unsuspecting customers fees and interest on accounts they didn't know they had, it doesn't surprise me if they intentionally sent out my statement late to charge me fees and interest."
5784,I received an invitation From XXXX XXXX the issuer Wells Fargo I have a fraud alert my application is on hold for days when I call them they dont know what to do to verify my id entity and approve my application this is ridiculous they claim its a new product and they still are fixing their systems and my other application also they have to complete verification for both of my applications to approve me I applied for my bilt XXXX and my reflect credit card its not fair

5791,"My credit card, wallet and phone were stolen back in XX/XX/XXXX. The card was fraudulent used on XX/XX/XXXX for charges which were {$1800.00} with XXXX  and {$320.00} with XXXX XXXX XXXX These charges were not made by me, authorized by me nor anyone I know. I have informed Wells Fargo and also informed them that they have no proof that I made the charge because there is none. They have added the charges back on my account illegally and telling me Im obligated to pay. I didnt make the charges and informed them in time about the card being stolen. Per fraud act Im not liable and have informed them that. They are illegally still putting the charges on my account. I need assistance getting this removed and corrected because as of now dealing with corporate bullying. We have seen the documentary and reports about the illegal practices that they have committed and still do."
5793,"I have a Wells Fargo credit card. I was offered a promotional balance of XXXX XXXX for a transfer fee which I accepted and was charged that transfer fee. Subsequent to the balance transfer, I made a purchase of {$280.00}. Within 8 days of that purchase ( within the grace period ) I submitted payments totaling {$300.00} as well as the minimum payment due ( before and after that billing cycle ). I was surprised to see that Wells Fargo was charging me interest at the regular purchases rate for that {$280.00} purchase. Instead of allocating my payments towards that purchase, Wells Fargo is allocating payments towards the promotional rate balance that is XXXX XXXX and that I already paid a transfer fee. With this bank policy, Wells Fargo will continue to charge the regular interest rate until that promotional balance is paid for thereby negating the entire purpose of accepting the promotional rate and paying that transfer fee. This appears to be an unfair practice by Wells Fargo."
5794,"XX/XX/XXXX : I received a phone call claiming to be Wells Fargo to inform me of potential false charges on my account. They had my cell phone number, credit card number & address. They confirmed my identity by texting my cell phone. I did not give any personal or identifying information. Because I was uncertain of the legitimacy of the call, immediately after, I contacted Wells Fargo directly via phone. The representative stated Wells Fargo never called me to report false charges. I had both my credit card and debit card deactivated as a precaution. 
XX/XX/XXXX : False charges first appeared on my credit card account but were dated to have occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. The charges appeared as follows : 1. $ XXXX XXXX 2. $ XXXX XXXX XXXX 3. $ XXXX XXXX XXXX As soon I saw the charges, I contacted Wells Fargo via phone to report the fraud. The representative stated the charges would be reversed and an investigation would take place. They reassured me I would not be held responsible for these charges. The money was credited back to my credit card account that day. 
I also filed a police report to XXXX XXXX that day to report the fraud. Report # XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter in the mail from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/XXXX stating "" We have completed our research of your claim about unauthorized transactions on your Wells Fargo credit card account. We have found that no fraud occurred or that the transactions were authorized. '' The charges were then added back to my credit card account. I called Wells Fargo after receiving the letter and they stated they would re-open the case per my request and also file a complaint to the executive committee. They stated I would be expected to receive a phone call from the executive committee within 24-48 hours. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo after not receiving a phone call. The representative assured me the case would be re-opened and I would receive a phone call from the executive committee within 24-48 hours. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo again after still not having received a phone call. The representative stated that he would have a supervisor call me within 24-48 hours. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call from Wells Fargo. The representative stated that he was a supervisor and had reviewed my case. He stated my case was officially re-opened for review. He indicated that my case had been improperly handled and had not been considered fraud in the first review. He stated my case absolutely classifies as fraud but he could not guarantee that the charges would be removed. He stated that Wells Fargo had received the faxed police report and that he expected the charges would be reversed after further review. However, it would take 10-15 days until I hear anything further. To date, I still have the total amount of {$8200.00} owed on my credit card account which I did not spend."

I have been notified that a payment on my account is more than 30 days past due and the non-payment has been reported to XXXX. The charges on the account are obviously fraudulent, since I did not make them. Please correct this mistake and remove the negative report from my account.

5799,"I have disputed account XXXX on my consumer reports with the 3 consumer reporting agencies and my results always result in a update or verified as accurate. 
XX/XX/XXXX I got all new reports from XXXX XXXX and XXXX and I noticed inconsistent information in regards to the federal running of reporting expiration date. 
XXXX reports XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX reports XX/XX/XXXX. 
XXXX reports XX/XX/XXXX with the date of 1st deliquency reported XX/XX/XXXX. 
since I cant get through to the consumer reporting agenies I decided to contact XXXX with a direct dispute under XXXX regarding this error. 
XX/XX/XXXX I wrote XXXX putting them on notice of this inconsistent error and also putting them on notice that a data furnisher is PROHIBITED to report any inaccurate, incomplete and inconsistent information after they have already been put on notice from this direct dispute XX/XX/XXXX they responded by requesting additional information from me in order to help them verify my identity? they asked for my residence from XX/XX/XXXX, the last 4 of my ss, my full birthdate, the credit limit on the account, the date or amount of the last payment and the account opened date. at the top of the letter they also notated the account number ending in XXXX with a INCORRECT mailing address. to my understanding if this data furnisher wants to report on my consumer reports then shouldn't they have all the information they requested from me in their files? this is not making any sense. I've sent them copies of my consumer reports regarding this account so they can see there inconsistent and inaccurate reporting. that should be enough to complete there investigation with the information they supposably have under my name. by XXXX sending me this correspondence, it proves to me that they dont have my information on file enough to report this account. if they lost paperwork in their files pertaining to this account then why dont they just say that? it is not my responsibility to give them private information and the burden of proof is not on me to prove. there furnishing this account to the consumer reporting agencies therefore they should have the requested information on file. this account seems to be not valid in my opinion all while inaccurate and inconsistent information is being reported to the third party consumer reporting agencies. I have also included my response to XXXX regarding there correspondence letter XX/XX/XXXX putting them on notice that this account is not valid and I demand a deletion."
5805,"I have a Wells Fargo credit card with a {$2500.00} limit. On XX/XX/2022 I made an online ACH payment of {$2200.00}, the outstanding balance on that date, from a checking account at another financial institution. The payment cleared my checking account on XX/XX/2022. On XX/XX/2022 my Wells Fargo mobile banking reflected an outstanding balance of {$330.00} and an available balance of {$0.00}. However, the Wells Fargo mobile banking application shows that the payment amount of {$2200.00} posted on XX/XX/2022. The Wells Fargo mobile banking application says the following about posted transactions : "" Posted transactions are fully processed and finalized credit card purchases and other transactions. '' I called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/2022 to inquire why my available balance was {$0.00}. I was told by the Wells Fargo representative that a 21 day hold was placed on payment. I asked that the hold be removed since the payment cleared and was told that could not be done. I asked to escalate the complaint and was transferred to another representative that told me the hold was for 15 days even though the payment cleared. I asked if the practice of placing holds on ACH payments was disclosed or communicated to customers and was told by the representative that the bank does not disclose the hold to customers unless the customer calls and asks about it after the fact. I again asked that the hold be removed and the representative said he was putting in a request for the hold to be removed. On XX/XX/2022 my available balance still showed that is was {$0.00} on my mobile banking application. I called the bank again on XX/XX/2022 and asked if the hold was going to be removed. The representative transferred my call to a manager who said that they would have to put in a request with the credit payment review department. He asked if I had an email or a fax machine so I could send in documentation. I asked what kind of documentation they needed to see that the payment was received. The manager could not answer my question other than saying they needed documentation to see if an ACH payment had been received. I gave them my email address. I asked if I could speak with someone in the credit payment review department and was told they do not have phones. On XX/XX/2022 my available balance on the credit card still reflected that it was {$0.00}. I received an email from the credit review department which requested that I send a copy of my bank account statement for the account that the payment was drawn on that shows the account balance before and after the the payment cleared. I do not want to send my bank account information from another financial institution to Wells Fargo because that is private information. Additionally, that information was not relied upon when XXXX XXXX made the credit decision to open my credit card line. On XX/XX/2022 I called the bank again to try to resolve my issue and I was transferred several times to different individuals. Almost an hour into the call I finally spoke with someone in the consumer advocacy department. I asked if the bank could verify that they received the ACH payment. I once again explained that the payment shows that it cleared my checking account at the other financial institution and that it also shows posted on my Wells Fargo mobile banking application. I was told by the individual in the consumer advocacy department that the bank has no way to verify that they received the funds, which I find hard to believe. I was told they could not help me. I think that the bank 's practice of placing a hold on my credit card account even though the payment cleared is both unfair and deceptive. During the period between XX/XX/2022 and XX/XX/2022 I have not had access to the {$2200.00} and I have not been able to use my card. This has caused me financial hardship as I needed that money to purchase goods and services. I made a payment for the full outstanding balance on XX/XX/2022 ; however, the minimum payment of {$25.00} was not due until XX/XX/2022. I have attached screenshots from my Wells Fargo online banking application, my most recent credit card periodic statement, communication received from the Wells Fargo credit payment review department, and information about the ACH payment that cleared on XX/XX/2022. I have spent more than 82 minutes on the phone with Wells Fargo regarding this issue with no progress toward resolution."

In fact, a decision was made to deny on XX/XX/2022 and I was never notified until I sent a request on XX/XX/2022. At this time I was provided a response by the merchant and the Vehicle Purchase Order ( page XXXX ) was obviously altered and does NOT match the same document that I have in my possession and was provided to Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX. This material fact of alteration seems to be continuously overlooked for some reason. By altering this vital document in this dispute, its outright misrepresentation and Fraud. 

At no time was I ever advised of any official means of appealing this dispute as is required by XXXX XXXX. Does Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX follow the Dispute procedures as outlined by XXXX XXXX or are they following some other procedure? 

On the first page of the ! st attachment this was in the text : We are unable to obtain a refund on your behalf because we have confirmed the merchant provided the services for which you were billed, and you accepted the services. 

At NO time did I accept an altered material change in the Vehicle Purchase Order ( page 5 ) that was sent to Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX.

I logged in to the Wells Fargo website XXXX day and saw a message saying that my WF credit card account had been closed. No warning, no phone calls, nothing. I still have a balance on the card and they are still asking me to pay it off. The closure of course had a substantial negative impact on my credit score but I don't care about that right now. I'm focused on paying off all my debt and not looking to add any more. What should I do? Can I get them to reinstate my credit card? Should I even bother? Should I refer to the fact that they canceled my card without forewarning, calls, or anything?"
5810,"Fraud dispute against Wells Fargo ( including a XXXX doc in the attachments for more readable formatting ) XX/XX/XXXX 1. I was out running XXXX errands in the morning between XXXX and XXXX, and I used my physical Wells Fargo credit card at two locations : o XXXX & XXXX XXXX XXXX TX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX TX XXXX XXXX. Sometime after those errands, my physical credit cards were stolen from my wallet. However, I do not know the exact time or location where/when they were taken. 

3. In the early afternoon, I took my daughters to a movie at the XXXX XXXX XXXX. While there, I purchased some refreshments. I paid for my refreshments with my XXXX XXXX. My XXXX XXXX is linked to my Wells Fargo credit card, which I still had not noticed was missing yet. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX TX XXXX 4. Later that evening, I went to use my Wells Fargo credit card and noticed it was gone. I went immediately to my online Wells Fargo app to turn off my credit card until I could find it so that no other purchases could be made in case it was lost or stolen. 
o NOTE : Two credit cards of mine were stolen, one which is a Wells Fargo card and another which is a XXXX credit card. Charges were made at almost exactly the same retailers on both cards. XXXX returned all my funds ( ~ {$530.00} ) once I reported them ; Wells Fargo has not. 

5. Later the next couple days, I noticed on my online account that several charges totaling {$990.00} were made to my credit card that I had not made. I believe they were made during the time I was at the movie, as the retailers visited were located in the similar area where I was and around the same time as our movie. The retailers included XXXX XXXX # XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I am including the credit card statement from this time ( Appendix A ). The dates listed on the statement are not the same as what was listed on my online transaction log, because I assume retailers submit their temporary transactions at different times as the real-time withdrawals from the account. 

o NOTE : I am also including the statement from my Chase credit card ( Appendix B ) so you can see that the same places were hit with a different credit card in my name. I include this also to note that I could not have been in two places at once. 

XX/XX/XXXX I called to report the cards lost and stolen to both Wells Fargo and XXXX. Wells Fargo reversed the transactions and submitted the funds back to my account at this time. They said they would do an investigation. 

The bank called several times over the next week asking for me to call and verify purchases. Each time, I returned their calls and answered all questions for their research. I verified the XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX purchases. I said I did NOT authorize the XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX # XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, and XXXX # XXXX purchases. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Wells Fargo ( XXXX XXXX ) saying that, Our research shows that you made a transaction after you reported that your card was lost or stolen and used without your authorization. Because of this, we can not accept your claim. 

I called Wells Fargo, and the representative said the issue was that I made a purchase at XXXX XXXX XXXX using the card after I reported the card being stolen and during the time that the disputed transactions ( at XXXX XXXX, XXXX, etc. ) were being made. 

I am arguing that this transaction was made using XXXX XXXX, which is connected to that account, before I turned the card off because I had not noticed the physical card was gone yet. 

I asked them to research it further. They sent notices on the following dates, saying either that they were researching the case and/or that no fraud occurred : XX/XX/XXXX ( researching case ) XX/XX/XXXX ( researching case ) XX/XX/XXXX ( no fraud occurred ) XX/XX/XXXX ( no fraud occurred ) XX/XX/XXXX ( no fraud occurred ) In the note from XX/XX/XXXX, the letter states that, Due to you having a valid XXXX XXXX transactions occurring between the charges in question, means you had the XXXX Chip Card in your possession during the charges in question. Again, my argument is that I used my XXXX XXXX during the time the stolen card was being used, so the XXXX Chip is a moot factor. 

To provide evidence to my argument, I reached out to the XXXX XXXX XXXX to see if they could provide documentation that I used my XXXX XXXX for that transaction. Unfortunately, they said they are not able to access that level of detail of my specific transaction. But they did confirm they have an XXXX XXXX point of sale offering at that location. ( Appendix D ) Finally, as another piece of evidence, I am attaching a list of my orders I use at XXXX ( a grocery store chain ). I almost exclusively use the XXXX app to order my groceries for curbside pick-up. I have used the XXXX in question ( # XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX in the past because it is in a nearby neighborhood to mine ( as are ALL the locations where the thieves used my cardsmore to my point that these were physically stolen from me and used in nearby places to where we were in a short amount of time ). But, this list of orders shows that I did not use order anything from that XXXX location in question on the date in question, XXXX XXXX. XXXX. I know this is not a direct piece of evidence, but it does add some validity to my claim that the transactions were NOT authorized by me. ( Appendix E ) Personal Background I have been a Wells Fargo customer since XXXX when I turned XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have had an overall very good experience with the company, using it for my college loans, checking and savings, personal loans, and credit card. I have never experienced any sort of issue like this. But now, I am likely to leave this bank, as it is clear they do not trust and respect their long-term customers. I can not afford for the company to not help me reclaim money that was stolen from my account again. 

I am a single parent of XXXX young children. I work full-time in a highly demanding job, where I have worked for 13 years. Every day, Im extremely busy and stressed which is why it has taken me nearly 2 months to file this complaint. I have no criminal record, I would never steal money, and I would certainly never do anything like this to cause me this level of stress. If it were {$50.00} someone had stolen, I may let it go. But nearly {$1000.00} is a significant amount of money for me, and I must try every effort to reclaim it."
5811,"On XX/XX/2022, I received a phone call from Wells Fargo phone number XXXX and the person I spoke to claimed they were a Wells Fargo Fraud Protection agent. This person then sent a 6-digit code to my cell phone via text to verify my identity. This is the same process Wells Fargo has in place to verify the identities of their customers, however this time, it was a fraud. I provided the 6-digit code to this person, thinking they were a trusted Wells Fargo representative XXXX This fraudster had now gained access to my account using the 6-digit code sent via text and performed the following activities. This unauthorized person withdrew {$1000.00} from my checking account via XXXX and pulled a cash advance of {$2900.00} from my credit card, transferred to my checking, and withdrew via wire transfer. I submitted a fraud claim to Wells Fargo within 5 hours of the event occurring on XX/XX/2022. As of XX/XX/2022, I was informed by Wells Fargo that my claims were denied and that I was liable for {$1000.00} XXXX transaction, the {$2900.00} cash advance as well as the cash advance fee of {$140.00} plus the interest that has accrued on the cash advance at a rate of 24.24 % APR. Their reason for denying the claims were that I authorized the transactions by providing the 6-digit code to the fraudster. However, my argument is that this fraudster utilized Wells Fargos own identity verification methods against me and I DID NOT authorize these transactions."
5813,I opened a secured card several years ago with Wells Fargo for {$1000.00}. I closed the account on XX/XX/XXXX with a {$0.00} balance and they said my deposit should be returned within 30 days. I still haven't received my deposit back. I'd like the CFPB to intervene and instruct them to return my deposit that is rightfully due.
5816,Well Fargo is fraudulently working with people to use ATM card. Well Fargo claims that I used my ATM card on XX/XX/22. Well Fargo did a shady investigation and refused to refund back my money
5820,"Due to a 8 week bout of XXXX ( both me and my spouse having it ) I got a moth behind on my Wells Fargo XXXX credit card. I'd never had any issues before and always paid on time whether it was enough to cover the whole amount or the minimum before. On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to make a payment, and the mobile app stated one amount as minimum payment ( as it was over the limit thanks to many outrageously high late fees applied plus interest ) The screen to pay on my mobile app was very confusing and told me the minimum payment to cover the amount was XXXX, so I paid that. It brought the amount down to {$2000.00}. This was also confusing as the apps interface made it seem that XXXX was going to be enough. When I went to make an additional payment, I got a message that I had to call in to pay the extra amount by phone as Wells Fargo somehow didn't accept payments from bank accounts from banks other than Wells Fargo. SO I called to see if I needed to pay more, and also to get my late fees waived as they were related to Covid reasons and they supposedly have a program and all these forgiveness programs for those affected to COVID. Although I did get behind by a month I was feeling better again I expected them to not only wave the late fees ( the reason the account was over the limit in the first place ) as Ive been a good paying customer for two years already, but also I expected to pay the over the limit account and to be given a cohesive explanation about the discrepancy on the minimum payments amounts shown on the interface. Instead I get a guy from XXXX, who refused to waive the fee at first then said he'd grant one but the bill wouldn't adjust till next billing cycle so if I wanted to pay the whole amount in full Id have to pay more than I actually owed. Meaning the waived fee wasn't going to show for the next thirty days. Unlike all the other banks where fee waiving and adjustments have shown next day the latest. He said that Wells Fargo didn't have any Covid help programs, but that the not having the fees shown until next bill is just the way Wells Fargo does business. He also refused to explain why I couldn't make another payment for the over the limit amount and couldn't tell me what was the actual minimum was and when I asked if I was covered he said I was but I was still over the limit ( which Wells Fargo has repeatedly reported to all credit agencies affecting my credit ) Of course I couldn't make an additional payment on the app due to Wells Fargo ridiculous policy that they had never disclosed. I asked to be transferred to a number in the US as the XXXX agent not only had an extremely rude manner, but couldn't understand nor answer my questions in a clear and concise way. I was transferred to an agent out of Arizona. She told me all I needed to pay to be under the limit was XXXX dollars and x cents and that I could give her my bank account and routing number to pay this and bring the account down to below minimum. I thought this was strange but gave her the numbers to pay. She said it was approved and even gave me a confirmation number ( XXXX ) for XXXX dollars. She also stated that she couldn't see the fee waived that the previous agent supposedly gave me and that she couldn't request a fee waiver. 
Today, XX/XX/XXXX, when I went to check my account not only had she NOT applied the payment AT ALL, but instead of having under 2000 balance, the balance went up to XXXX ( it was XXXX after I made the initial XXXX payment and before the XXXX dollar payment. ) There was no explanation no fee no payment of XXXX dollars to explain why my account went up, as the cycle is not even over. Now I'm fearful Wells Fargo will keep adding random unexplained fees and that they will keep reporting me to the credit agencies even tho I made a payment on time, and I also fear that I might have been scammed into providing my routing and account number to the last agent I spoke to, as she never applied it to my account."
5821,"Hi, my name is XXXX XXXX and I have been dealing with a significant issue with Wells Fargo regarding late payments on a secured credit card which is supposed to be helping to boost/establishing my credit and in quite it is doing the opposite. Please see the attached documentation."
5822,"Credit card was charged for other peoples XXXX XXXX that I do not know, reported it to wells Fargo and they put it "" under investigation '', meanwhile I ordered a new card with new numbers and have NOT activated it. Now being charged for XXXX XXXX again on a card that is not activated that only wells Fargo know the information to the card."
5826,I have not made a cash advance in over a year and my Wells Fargo bank keeps charging me interest fees every month and when I called and talked to a banker she told me that I will have to pay that fee until I pay the entire credit card balance off. I don't quite understand that when I am paying a interest fee for my regular purchases which is fair. Example XXXX  Statement : Interest charge on purchases {$11.00} Interest charge on cash advances {$39.00}
5827,The credit card company sent me an annual fee for my card. I paid it and now they are showing i'm 30 days late paying the fee.
5829,"No money has been withdrawn to my knowledge, or used. However, there is still a hard inquiry on my credit report from someone who attempted to open an account with Wells Fargo ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/21. If the credit application was declined, that's great however it is affecting my credit score and needs to be removed!"
5830,"I did a balance transfer from Wells Fargo to XXXX XXXX for a total of {$5800.00}. The transaction was concluded on XX/XX/2022, with XXXX XXXX showing the balance I owed them as of that date. 
But, Wells Fargo still shows that I owe them the {$5800.00}, and their representative says it will take 1 to 3 days to post... BUT, they acknowledge that transaction took place because they already adjusted my available credit, but they will NOT let me use it, as the actual balance amount was NOT updated.

So, Wells Fargo has DELIBERATELY programmed their a system to DELAY adjusting the credit balance so they can continue to charge interest on the {$5800.00} even though they have that money.

This is yet another example of why Wells Fargo should be sanctioned and fined for continuing their criminal behavior, over and over, and over again."
5832,"I am disputing a charge for new flooring in the amount of {$9200.00} the charge was made on my Wells FargoXXXX credit card. My claim ID is XXXX. The floors were not installed properly and never finished. When I submitted the claim I was told it would take 60 days to resolve. It has been nearly 8 months since I submitted my claim. 
Prior to submitting the claim, I allowed the company, XXXX XXXX, an opportunity to fix the floors and they wanted to fix it with a stain marked. This is not an acceptable solution as the marker doesn't last and will come off with the first mop. The floors are ruined and can not be fixed. The floors need to be replaced. Glue has cured into the grooves and has left a white haze all over my new floors. 
The claim was submitted with XXXX XXXX before the job was ever finished. ( Claim number XXXX ) The company has been given multiple opportunities to fix the problem but the only way this can be fixed is to replace the floors. All I am asking for is a refund and I will have a more professional company redo their mistake."
5834,"I am a victim of wire fraud. I am a Wells Fargo account holder and XXXX + was stolen and transferred into a XXXX XXXX XXXX Account. The thief used a different phone ( sim ) to get past the authorization so that they could transfer and steal my money. 

Wells Fargo assigned a Case number to me and told me that they would return my money to my accounts after their 10 business days hold. Needless to say, Wells Fargo determined that I would not be able to get my money back because they ( XXXX ) was unable to retrieve the money from the XXXX XXXX Account. Wells Fargo gave me the account number and the name of the business where the funds went but they won't give me the money back. So much for FDIC ( Insurance ).

I have uploaded a letter and additional supporting documents so that it would assist you in any investigation that you might initiate.

5835,"I purchased furniture from XXXX 's XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX that I have never received. The furniture was supposed to be delivered on XX/XX/XXXX. It never came. A new delivery date was rescheduled without consulting me for XX/XX/XXXX and again nothing came. Then I was given a XX/XX/XXXX delivery date and again nothing. I was rescheduled again for XX/XX/XXXX and if you are following the predictable trend nothing was received. I was then given a XX/XX/XXXX date and then days before that date arrived I was notified that the product will be out of stock until late XXXX. Since I have been waiting for this furniture for several months and I don't know if or when I will receive it, I can not continue to pay for this furniture. I will not be sending any more payments towards this furniture until someone at XXXX 's XXXX XXXX takes leadership and ownership of this issue and resolve it. I have attempted to resolve this issue with store XXXX named XXXX and customer service supervisor XXXX. I explained to both of them you can not set a delivery date without consulting me first because the item needs to be delivered when I am home. XXXX has been less than helpful and XXXX has tried but so far he has not been successful. I also do not find customer service at Wells Fargo to be helpful, friendly, or customer focused. So far I have not had the best experience trying to communicate with Wells Fargo so given all of the challenges I am having I thought it was best to write my concerns out in the form of a complaint because the listening skills experienced so far at Wells Fargo has only added to the problems. I have found both XXXX 's XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo to be unreasonable. XXXX 's XXXX XXXX is not communicating with me effectively nor are they making a real effort to deliver the furniture to me. Wells Fargo has started billing me when I haven't received the product yet and customer service has been lacking."
5837,"I ordered furniture from XXXXXXXX XXXX. However, I did not receive the complete order. I did not authorize the merchant to charge me for the order until all was received. 

The merchant agreed to a lesser amount, and I paid for XXXX order on my card from another bank NOT WELLS FARGO. 

For over 90 days Wels Fargo played games with disputing the charge and not handling it as unauthorized. I have spent over 20 hours on the phone ( all recorded ). 

Every time I call a different rep tells me a different bit of information. 

All lies and never consistent. 

I have asked for and never received any supporting docs from the bank. NOTHING!"
5839,"I opened an account with Wellsfargo credit Last year in XXXX Or XXXX. I have an amazing credit history. I used that card specifically for my expenses in XXXX and to travel to XXXX. 
There is 2 issues here : 1. I have opened their Wellsfargo app and I DID setup the Automatic Payment after 2 - 3 weeks of receiving the card and the Wells Fargo app confirmed that it was set up correctly. 
2. I NEVER received an EMAIL or a MAIL that my bill is due. Note : The min i opened an investigation with them they started to send me MAIL but that was the only when I complained and reached out to their department. 

I setup an Automatic payment for the minimum amount due which was XXXX $ - XXXX $ how can someone who makes XXXX plus a year miss such an amount? 

This was on XX/XX/2019. I have screenshots from my credit showing that the payment was scheduled but it was never taken. 

I have tried to dispute using all credit Bureau but nothing was updated from the past 6 months NOTE : They May say that my address was changed and the letter was sent to the previous address. That is a LIE, the previous address is still my address as well and my parents and lease is under my name. No letters were received till I opened the investigation with them. 

After this complaint I will pursue a Legal lawsuit against them if they do not remove it."
5840,"I have been patiently waiting on their response to the written requests I sent. However, any modes of response or coordination were not taken on their end. They have not complied with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 USC Sections 1681i within the time allowed by law and continued reporting as unverified information which now, given all my attempts to address it directly with the creditor, as wilful negligence and non-compliance with federal statutes. Below are the lists of the erroneous accounts reporting on my credit report : Wells Fargo XXXX WELLS FARGO BANK, XXXX. XXXX"
5841,My checking account was hacked into on XX/XX/XXXX and there were multiple purchase transactions to my account with m debit card. When there was no money left in the account the hacker pulled {XXXX} from a joint checking account that I have and also did a telephone transfer of {XXXX} from my XXXX card. I contacted my bank immediately on XX/XX/XXXX and filed a fraud report for the transactions in my checking account. The credit card was not included in this complaint as it required to go to another department. When I was told this in XX/XX/XXXX I then contacted the credit card fraud department. At first they refunded the {XXXX} advance and removed all related fees. Then they reversed them back out and said that we were responsible for paying back the credit card as the {XXXX} was in my checking account which is was not the hackers had used that money as well. I appealed the first notice of the claim in XXXX and on XXXX XXXX received another letter that the case had been closed and they found that there had not been any fraud. I called again today and asked to have a copy of the recorded phone transfer and was told I could only get that information by court order. I have filed another appeal and provided great details to the person that I spoke with today. I can provide the transactions that occurred on XX/XX/XXXX and am certain that myself or my wife did not make a telephone transfer of funds from our credit card.
5845,"ON XX/XX/XXXX I WAS GOING OVER MY CHECKING ACCOUNT AND NOTICED, THAT THERE WAS A WARNING SIGN ON MY CREDIT CARD STATEMENT. THIS WAS DONE LOOKING AT IT ON MY CELL PHONE. IT SAID THAT I WAS OVER MY LIMIT. SO I STARTED LOOKING AT THE CHARGES. THERE WERE 18 CHARGES ON MY CREDIT CARD THAT DID NOT BELONG TO ME. SO I CALL WELLSFARGO CREDIT CARD FRAUD DEPARTMENT, AND TOLD THEM THAT THESE WERE CHARGES THAT I DID NOT MAKE. I TOLD THEM THST THE LAST TIME THAT I USED MY CARD WAS AT THE XXXX XXXX XXXX ON XXXX XXXX, AT XXXX XXXX, I WAS LEAVING MY NIGHT JOB, GETTING READY TO GO TO MY DAY JOB AT XXXX XXXX. IN THE BEGINNING THEY GAVE ME MY MONEY BACK, THEN THEY REVERSED IT. THEY SAID, THAT MY CARD WAS PHYSICALLY USED. I TOLD THEM THAT THAT COULDN'T BE BECAUSE I HAVE MY CARD. THEY BASICALLY CALLED ME A LIE. THEY NEVER INVESTIGATED ANYTHING. ONE OF THE CHARGES ON MY STATEMENT WAS FOR A HOTEL IN XXXX, I HAD MY SISTER LOOK IT UP. WE GOT A PHONE NUMBER CALLED THEM THEN WENT DOWN TO THE HOTEL. I ASKED THE MANAGER, YOU GUYS DON'T CHECK ID WHEN CHECKING IN. HE SAID IT WAS DONE MOBILE TO MOBILE. THAT THEY NEVER HAVE TO EVEN SEE THE PERSON. IT WAS A SIGNATURE ON THE RECEIPT THAT DID NOT BELONG TO ME. SO THERE WAS A WELLSFARGO ACROSS THE STREET I WENT OVER AND SPOKE TO A BANKER THERE. HE REACHED OUT TO THE CREDIT CARD DEPARTMENT ON MY BEHALF, AND SUBMITTED THE DOCUMENTS THAT I GOT FROM THE HOTEL, VIA FAX. THEY DENIED ME A SECOND TIME, SAYING THAT THEY INVESTIGATED. DENIED ME AGAIN. SO I FILLED OUT A POLICE REPORT SUBMITTED TO THEM, VIA FAX. THEY DENIED IT AGAIN SAYING THAT THE CARD WAS PHYSICALLY PRESENT .I TALK TO SOMEONE FROM A DIFFERENT BANK AND THEY TOLD ME SINCE I FILED A POLICE REPORT THAT I CAN ASK FOR ALL CAMERS TO BE PULLED. SO ON XX/XX/XXXX I CALLED AND SPOKE TO A SHARETTAIN CLAIMS, AND ASK ALL CAMERS TO BE PULLED. I ASKED FOR PROOF AND DOCUMENTATION SENT TO ME. THEY TOLD ME I HAVE TO WAIT. I HAVE TAKEN OFF WORK TO TRY AND HANDLE THIS. IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING. I BEEN IN TEARS. PLEASE HELP!!!!"
5851,"By letter dated XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo Bank requested additional information regarding my credit card application because they were purportedly unable to confirm my identity. I am a US citizen with a real ID drivers license and a passport. I have lived at the same address for 35 years in Maine. I called the indicated phone number XXXX and the bank employee told me to mail in a copy of 1 ) my photo ID drivers license, 2 ) copy of a current electricity bill showing my name and address and 3 ) copy of a current water utility bill showing my name and address. I sent these copies by US mail on XX/XX/XXXX to Wells Fargo Bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX IA XXXX. By letter dated XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo indicated they had received my request to reevaluate my credit card application but denied the request because my "" identity can't be verified. ''"
5853,"1 ) Made lower payments on the account, not in full amount, called in to discuss lower payments, no resolution. I call in over 6 times in XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, over 20 times in XXXX. Longest call was over an hour. I was never told account would potentially be closed prior to its closing due to lower payment amounts, which I informed them of a change and inquired of solutions and given none to stop the close of the account. 
2 ) This account was open for nearly 10 years, yet all it took was after 2 missed payments, when it was abruptly closed without any acknowledgement, letter or call before or after it closed. I found out when I tried to make a payment online and could not access the account. 
3 ) I had no access to account via Online banking, which is my primary form of banking and was given no explanation. When I called Online Banking, which handles situations like this regarding the account, yet they had no further explanation and had no way to restore access to the account so that I could make payments at my convenience ( the way I was able to access this account before ) and did not inform me of other ways. Reps from different departments including Online Banking claimed they could not "" see '' the account. It became invisible so to speak. When I called in the representatives did not know what was going on. Then I was given information it was conflicting -I was told the account was closed, I was told it was in collections, pre-legal sometimes simultaneously on the same day speaking with different reps. I was also told it was in pre-legal, legal and legal remedies, sometimes I was told this information simultaneously on the same day speaking with different reps. All the information was conflicting and misleading. 
4 ) However, despite my having no access to this account via Online banking and all access to it being XXXX, Wells Fargo decides to steal from my connected checking account by accessing it and taking over {$3700.00} from it in payment. I found out about this when I tried to make a debit purchase that I knew funds in my checking account would cover and the transaction was denied. Then when I called into Wells Fargo about my checking account -they could not tell me who the merchant was (??? ). I clearly did not know, because I did not have a debit planned, so I did not know what this transaction was and neither did Wells Fargo. The incompetent thing was that neither did Wells Fargo. They did not know what this was yet later I found out they could see "" XXXX XXXX '' in the description. So now my checking account is overdrawn and the rep is acting as if they can not immediately return those funds so that I can clear a bill that is going to come out! I had to speak with a supervisor about this who did tell me it may be internal, but said they would return the funds, which happened, although it should have been just as immediate. They returned the stolen funds. I later received a letter that this was an Automatic Payment ( to the "" closed '' credit card account ) and all future ones have been XXXX. This does not make any sense. Why would automatic payments be on the account when the account was "" closed? '' I did not have access to the credit account via Online Banking and any functions tied to this account were XXXX. Wells Fargo reps did not have any access to the credit card account and could not "" see it '' when I called in. Also, previous payments were deleted, so why did this "" payment '' get stolen from my checking account after the credit card account was closed? 

5 ) Additionally, when I was told the account was being handled internally at a department called "" collections '' or "" pre-legal '' or "" legal '' at different times on the same day by different reps. I was told I had time to find a solution for this account and to call different numbers, and finally this one : ( XXXX ) XXXX, yet, when I called numerous times to the number provided no one answered and this was during hours of operation, listed by the Wells Fargo rep and on the answering recording. Sometimes, the Wells Fargo reps would place me on hold to call this number and return to say no one picked up or that the phone just disconnected. { Why would they pull this charade, to accelerate the credit card account placing it in a law office and then say no one contacted us, which is what they said happened ( see 6 ) }? 
5a ) I even complained by calling to the CC Case Management department with 2 case numbers and I do n't think they resolved the situation. The rep I spoke to did not seem to take this seriously at times and I do n't think he actually spoke with the manager at that number as claimed because the problem persisted. Additionally, when I called to see if anything had been done I was told it was "" proprietary '' and this was not to be shared with consumers. Ridiculous. There needs to be more transparency. Additionally, I am surprised there is a manager when I was lied to when I called when I encountered a nasty rep who denied that department had managers at all and that I was unable to speak to one or another rep when I did not want to take the verbal abuse she tried to spew toward me, the consumer. 

6 ) XXXX notes. Nasty customer service. Additionally, despite all the calls, Wells Fargo reps are putting incorrect notes on the account, not documenting my various calls and claim I only called once in XXXX! When I called over 6 times. Because, I did not contact them, which is not true, or because of the faulty notes placed on the account, the credit card account is accelerated to an external law office and I am told there is no way it can be reversed by a nasty-style-of-communication rep named XXXX in the legal department. When I called the insensitive, offensive, nasty rep named XXXX who made fun of/mocked my name and sounded very discriminatory whom I spoke to in the "" pre-legal '', "" legal '' or "" legal remedies '' department ( -depending on who you speak to, you are given different names with the same number ) said we have to treat accounts the same and "" not discriminate '', yet this account was not treated the same. It was accelerated to the external law office, based on faulty notes and information, and I was told misinformation by reps at Wells Fargo about what was happening to the account. I asked to speak with a different rep and I also asked to speak with a manager, she said I could not speak with either and tried to continue her abusive tone and phone manners toward me. I did not get any substantial answers from this call. 

When I called previously the account was is an internal "" collections '' department, yet I am being contacted by an external law office. How can two different places be handling this account at the same time how can it be in "" collections '' within Wells Fargo ( not external ) and then be at an external law office at the same time. ( See point 7. ) 7 ) I received two letters simultaneously and dated differently by Wells Fargo and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. These letter say conflicting information and are both dated in XXXX on 10 days apart. XXXX is dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX provided to me by Wells Fargo saying a "" Notice of acceleration on credit card ending in ************. '' Saying the whole amount is due and to contact them. Then, I receive a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating to contact them and make the whole balance payment. 
This is hardly helpful to any consumer to be told the same thing at the same time by two different entities. Most require 30 days after letter is dated. Then when a consumer calls there is no clarification. Getting these two confusing and conflicting letters at the same time, unethically accelerating this credit card account and providing XXXX information is wrong. 

8 ) Sent correspondence for them to lower interest rate, instead they increased credit line. Is this a predatory lending practice?"
5854,I have had my Wells Fargo credit card since XXXX. The account started as a secured credit card which was converted to a non-secured card in XXXX. My account has always been in good standing yet every credit line increase I requested has been denied. I think that because I have been a good standing customer for the last 9 years should account for something in regards to my credit line increase request
5855,"On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX representative came out to price me on a project and to establish the financing. Approaching XX/XX/XXXX ( scheduled date of install ) I was given an appointment reminder and asked to review the financing aspect. Thats when I found out XXXX fraudulently got a credit card made in my name without my knowledge with Wells Fargo ( WF ). All of their advertisements also only stated 0 % APR for 18 months, and their rep NEVER disclosed establishing financing by creating a new credit card. I even adamantly asked about the type of financing ; I never would have signed off on the creation of a new credit card, therefore, the WF credit card was fraudulently created. I had worked with both companies to close the WF account and to get it removed from my credit report. Only the closed status was updated ; neither company has helped to get it removed from my credit report."
5857,"Wells Fargo has incorrectly marked my XX/XX/XXXX personal Credit Report as 30 Days late for XX/XX/XXXX. My statement date ( which is supported with credit card monthly statement ) clearly shows the statement dates of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 
- The payment while late, was received on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of XXXX, which covered the past due account. I was justly charged a past due late fee, but the payment was received exactly 28 days late. Not 30. Therefore the it is inaccurate and must be removed. 
- My payment Due date is not my statement billing period. Statement Billing period determines the credit reporting days of delinquency. I have attached my monthly billing statement for your review. 
- Please review the account, as a mere count of the calendar days will show the error and quickly resolve this dispute."
5861,"In XXXX of XXXX, I received an alert that my Wells Fargo credit card payment was late. This was an alert from one of the credit reporting bureaus, and not an alert from Wells Fargo. Apparently, they thought it was more appropriate to contact the credit bureau before contacting me directly... 

This alert came as a surprise to me, because I hadn't used my Wells Fargo credit card for about a year. I also hadn't been receiving statements, so I had no visibility of what was occurring with the account. 

I immediately reported the fraudulent charges to Wells Fargo. Somebody investigated and sent me a letter. The letter said that the fraudulent charges would be removed. 

In XXXX of XXXX, Wells Fargo reported me to the credit bureau again. Apparently, they lied when they said the charges would be removed. 

I paid off the account at that time, to prevent further damage to my credit report. I had no idea the amount of the balance. I made my best guess, and apparently I overpaid a little. 

Fast forward to XXXX of XXXX. After many contacts with Wells Fargo, I finally get a complete copy of my credit card statements. But, they still have not refunded the fraudulent charges. 

I carefully reviewed the statements, and I was able to determine that all of the charges on the account were not made by me -- they were fraudulent charges. I submitted yet another claim, but this time I was able to provide details from the statement. 

And after many more contacts initiated by me, I've been thoroughly ignored."
5866,"Wells Fargo co ntinues to allow fradulent transactions to occur with my credit card account. I have not authorized a purchase from my secured credit card account since   XXXX  . In fact, after requesting a new card  in  XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX , I  have not used this account at all except to add a {$20.00} credit online.     Although I have not used this credit card account, I now have  two ne w charges from  XXXX   XXXX    XXXX   XXXX   OK for { $130.00} on   XXXX   XXXX   and another charge from the same company for {$82.00}. It is important to note here that I HAVE NOT DONE BUSINESS WITH  XXXX  IN NEARLY  TWO YE AR AND I HAVE NEVER DONE BUSINESS WITH  XXXX  IN   XXXX   XXXX   SO THIS CHARGE IS UNAUTHORIZED, FRAUDULENT, AND BOTH  WELLS FA  RGO A ND  XXXX  ARE NOW PREJUDICING MY RIGHTS AND I INTEND TO SUE IF THIS IS NOT RESOLVED WITHIN 15 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THIS COMPLAINT I actually noticed the {$82.00} charge not even a week after  Wells Fargo r esolved my last CFPB and transaction dispute complaints. This previous dispute with   XXXX   XXXX   took over 2 months to resolve, so you ca n imagine my  frustration that just days after my funds were returned to my account I received a new unauthorized charge from  XXXX  in   XXXX   XXXX   for {$82.00}. Instead of working quickly and diligently to resolve this new unauthorized charge, at leas t two different Wells Fargo agen ts harassed me to pay my bill to reduce my balance. I informed them that I did not feel comfortable paying the bill until these disputes were taking care of because my account was already overdrawn as a result of these unauthorized fraudulent charges.     Under duress, I finally decided to transfer {$20.00} to my credit card account from my checking account becaus e I was afraid Wells Fargo would  begin negatively reporting to my credit profile. I was afraid of this because this is what  one of the Wells Fargo agents told me. To comply with his harassing orders, I submitted th is {$20.00} payment from my checking to my credit card on   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    . It was my hope that this would kee p Wells Fargo from  adding negative remarks to my credit profile. I was uncomfortable making this payment, again, because my account would still be overdrawn because of this new fraudulent transaction.      Wells Fargo re versed this {$82.00} charge and then added the UNAUTHORIZED AND FRAUDULENT charge back to my account as if I never filed the dispute. When I checked on the status of this dispute, I was told that  XXXX , the company, still has n't responded so the dispute is still pending . Wells Fargo has  completely ignored my testimony that I HAVE NOT DONE BUSINESS WITH  XXXX  IN NEARLY TWO YEAR AND I HAVE NEVER DONE BUSINESS WITH  XXXX  IN   XXXX   XXXX   SO THIS CHARGE IS UNAUTHORIZED, FRAUDULENT, AND BOTH  WELLS FARGO  AND  XXXX  ARE NOW PREJUDICING MY RIGHTS AND I INTEND TO SUE IF THIS IS NOT RESOLVED WITHIN 15 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THIS COMPLAINT Even more recently, I have noticed that  Wells Fargo ha s allowed yet another UNAUTHORIZED AND FRAUDULENT charge to post to my account. This charge posted on   XXXX   XXXX   from  XXXX  in   XXXX   XXXX   for {$130.00}. I HAVE NOT DONE BUSINESS WITH  XXXX  IN NEARLY  TWO YE AR AND I HAVE NEVER DONE BUSINESS WITH  XXXX  IN   XXXX   XXXX   SO THIS CHARGE IS UNAUTHORIZED, FRAUDULENT, AND BOTH  WELLS FARGO AN D  XXXX  ARE NOW PREJUDICING MY RIGHTS AND I INTEND TO SUE IF THIS IS NOT RESOLVED WITHIN 15 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THIS COMPLAINT.     After learning that  XXXX  and   XXXX   XXXX   companies have previously merged, I am now under the impression that  Wells Fargo  is allowing  XXXX  to fraudulent charge my account for portions of the amount I previously disputed from   XXXX   XXXX  .  Wells Fargo continues to prejudice my rights by being nonresponsive, combative, and unprofession al during these dispu tes. Wells Fargo has a lso continued to charge me interest, late fees, overdraft penalties etc while my account has been in dispute. For the record, I would like to reiterate that I have not even made purchases with this  Wells Fargo ac count since   XXXX   XXXX     because of the way this account has been mismanaged by  Wells Fargo agents. I intent to sue WELLS FARGO I F THIS IS NOT RESOLVED WITHIN 15 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THIS COMPLAINT."
5867,Wells Fargo continued to contact me by email regarding a credit card application ( that I did not make ) and subsequent credit card approval.
5870,"Dear Sir or Madam : I have submitted many complaints about this. Each time, the company responds back that they want something addition, and I go and figure out how to do it. The latest request from the company was to open a police report, which I did with one of the local municipalities where the card was used fraudulently. My problem is that the company ( Wells Fargo ) is still not processing the fraud claim in my favor. They have repeatedly told me that I am responsible, but as someone who did not use the card at any of the locations in question, nor did I authorize anyone to use my card at any of those places, i'm requesting that they process this claim as fraud, and close ALL of my accounts with their company. 

Since this case was originally opened, they have asked me many times about certain things, called me up and asked questions, and because of the age, I assume that my answers were as good as I could based on my own recollection of what happened almost a year ago at this point. 

I will be resubmitting this information to you and ask that Wells Fargo actually look at ALL of the signatures and see that they do not match. I have already and will be attaching samples of my own signature for comparrison, and if they want me to do this at a branch again, all they have to do is ask. 

Wells Fargo, had told me to go to the branch to continue the dispute, request that the branch verify my signature in front of them and have it faxed, as well as many other things, but each and every time, they just mark my claim denied. I have always paid all of my credit card bills on time and prior to this issue with this company, i did not have any issues with my credit. 

It is unreasonable for Wells Fargo to assume that I have the ability to locate the perpetrators of the fraud, nor are they willing to give me any additional information about the time of the transactions to assist the police department in question with any of their own investigation. The police were willing to look at one of the transactions at one location without a time, but were not willing to look at all of them. Wells Fargo has been instructed to provide additional information to the police department in question with any additional information that they have in regards to those charges, and it will be pursued. 

It is not my fault that no new information can be given to Wells Fargo as they keep requesting, as I do not know who did the fraud, how they did the fraud, exactly where I misplaced my credit cards, nor how to continue to pursue this any further, but as a normal and sane individual, i am unwilling to pay for charges that I did not do. 

Because I know that I '' m not responsible, If Wells Fargo wants me to sign my signature as many times as they need to in their branch locations to compare versus the actual signatures from any of the transactions, i would be more than willing to provide this, and have stated this many times. This should be more than sufficient to prove without a shadow of a doubt that I did not do these transactions, although it would require some work on their part to get copies of the actual receipts. 

If Wells Fargo is going to deny this claim just on the fact that some of the transactions were at similar or same locations as an older fraud claim, then they need to provide me with the above so that I can get additional details and proof of my exact location at the time of those transactions."
5875,Wells Fargo Bank as the wrong social security number listed on my Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX credit card account. XXXX isnt my correct social number. My correct social security number and date of birth is : SSN : XXXX DOB : XX/XX/XXXX
5876,"Last year around XX/XX/XXXX I had to stop paying my credit card due to the interest fee spiking and for some reason they kept increasing my limit to charge those interest fees and late fees. I had just gotten out of the military and was using my credit card to survive. Unfortunetly the fees ( interest, and late fees ) built up so much my monthly payment was too high for me to pay. So I stopped paying around XX/XX/XXXX and around XX/XX/XXXX I called to try to get on a payment plan. They put me on one where I was paying XXXX a month. I agreed to this and set my payments for the XXXX of the month for 4 months out. I even had to verbally confirm those 4 payments to come out which I did. So my XXXX payment came out and come XX/XX/XXXX Im getting calls of a missed payment. I call sometime early XXXX to discuss why my XXXX payment never came out when I verbally confirmed the XXXX for 4 months. They told me I only had a XXXX time payment ( which wasnt true ) I asked if I had to repay that month to catch up and they told me no. That I could just schedule again and it will pick up right where I left off. So I set the dates for the XXXX of the month ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ). The past week ( early XXXX ) I kept getting calls about how they ( wellsfargo ) can better help me. I had already made 2 months of payments at XXXX $ but I had a bad feeling so I called again. I was told I was removed from the program in XXXX because of the missed payment. Which was the total opposite of what I was told prior. Seeing as I had more payments set up and have now had 2 payments come out and its not lowering anything. Its actually still RAISING my credit card with late fees and interest fees. I have never felt more played in my life Im trying to pay back what I owe and I have been lied to and Im losing money I barely have every month for it to go nowhere, other than in the pocket of wellsfargo. The last person I talked to on the phone seemed to be the only helpful one. Shes the only one that noticed there was a problem and shes the only one that offered a program for military personnel. However that does not change that they are telling me one thing and doing another. My debt that I used was maybe around 5,000 $ and that card is racked up to around 8,900 $ as of today. Since my payment plan started in XXXX it has increased almost 800 . My credit card shouldve never raised the limit from XXXX $ and I feel like they did that just to get more money out of me. I have never in my life requested an increase in my limit when it originally started at XXXX $ I understand at times they raise it when you do well but I wasnt and they keep raising it to get more money. This experience is ruining my life I am constantly stressed and feel like giving up. I try to make it work and own up to my debt but they will do anything to get more money from me. For others the biggest advice I can give is pay attention to the increases on your limit and set alarms on the dates you have scheduled for a payment to come out that way they cant play you."
5877,Wells fargo accepted my 1st payment of XXXX via XXXX  saving/prepaid gov card. Now that I owe XXXX they XXXX  refusing XXXX accept payment unless my act goes into default. This is not acceptable! It is in good standing and I needXXXX have it that way as I am applying for mortgae housing so much as XXXX  doing may make me loose the home XXXX am applying for. These XXXX  their typical ussuary playbook tactics they XXXX notorious for. They must take payment from me from an acct they've already accepted payment from and stop playing these games
5881,I have a {$110.00} delinquent balance on a Wells Fargo Secured credit card from over 6-7 years ago. I have contacted Wells Fargo numerous times over the last 3 years to resolve and pay this amount and I keep getting told that they cant pull it up in their system. It is hurting my credit tremendously and Im not sure how to fix it if Wells Fargo cant accept payment from me or find it in their system.
5883,I had purchased flights through XXXX XXXX  XXXX on XX/XX/2019 with my Wells Fargo XXXX credit card. The flight was canceled in XXXX due to Covid and I have called them and messaged them on XXXX and they are saying that the refund is still just in progress and it has been over 5 months.
5884,"On : XXXX XXXXXX/XX/2022 Wells Fargo decided to Close my ATM Card, for at least a Year. They told me that I misused their ATM Card, for Disputes that I did on my ATM Card constantly."
5891,On XX/XX/2021 I was at a nightclub and later through the night I had noticed someone stole my phone. On XX/XX/2021 when I went to purchase a new phone I noticed a XXXX XXXX transaction that I did not authorize. The person that stole my phone authorized a online advance of {$1000.00} on my Wells Fargo platinum credit card and included {$500.00} from my Wells Fargo debit account in this transaction. I filed a police report with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The incident number is XXXX and their phone number is XXXX. I also filed the reports with my phone insurance provider XXXX as well as XXXX and XXXX. Both of the companies verified the fraud and was able to authorize my request for a phone replacement and {$2500.00} refund. Wells Fargo seems to be the only company that will not refund the remaining amount of {$1500.00} that was stolen. I would like to also mention that Wells Fargo refunded {$330.00} additional dollars that was stolen but for some reason they will not refund the remaining {$1500.00} that I have yet to receive.
5893,"Wells Fargo Wise Visa Platinum Card is taking advantage of double dipping with interest rates on cash advances along with cash advance fees as well as interest on purchases. XX/XX/2018 is when I began noticing all the fees and interest rates adding up and my credit card balance not going down. I have tried understanding what they base their charges on when contacting them, but not being a banker or stockbroker, I have no clue what an Average Daily Balance is or what an Annual Percentage Rate does. If they would just roll one fee or one interest rate into what I owe, I could see the progress with my credit card balance going down instead of not changing after I make a payment which doesn't even seem to touch the principal."
5895,"I received a Letter from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/2022 denying me a credit card. ( Application XXXX ) In the letter was information from XXXX about my negative credit rating ( XXXX ) and delinquencies on payments. 
1. I never applied for this credit card. 
2. My credit rating has always been in the high XXXX or low XXXX. 
I checked with XXXX on XX/XX/2022 my credit score was XXXX ). 
3. I contacted Wells Fargo four times by phone informing them I did not apply for their credit card and to immediately cancel the fraudulent application. 
4. The result of all four phone contacts is that Wells Fargo has not cancelled the application. 
5. If Wells Fargo does not cancel this fraudulent application but instead categorizes it as being denied for credit issues while using erroneous, incorrect information it will appear on my credit report as being denied. 
6. Wells Fargo obviously furnished XXXX incorrect information from a fraudulent application that was not my correct information. 
7. I received a letter and five page Declaration of Fraud form from Wells Fargo. The form asks me to investigate whether or not this is a fraudulent application. Additionally the form threatens me with criminal prosecution if I submit a false declaration. 
8. I am unclear why and how I am responsible for investigation of this fraudulent application. Particularly since it was Wells Fargo that submitted erroneous, falsified information about me to XXXX. I have never experienced this level of arrogance, and unprofessional behavior from a service company that charges fees for their services. I have been a professional government official for 50 years and have never witnesses this level of incompetence."
5896,I closed this credit card with Wells Fargo on either XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX of this year. The account was closed after a significant number of issues with extremely poor customer service. I went to a branch office here on XXXX XXXX in XXXX Colorado. I specifically asked to be able to pay any outstanding balance. To the best of my recollection I paid with cash. I specifically gave instructions not to accept any more charges. I would resolve any charges specifically with merchants. I went home and threw away the credit card. Weeks later I continue to receive mailings and phone calls indicating I owe a balance and late fees. Attempts to resolve the issue with Wells Fargo have been met with continuing confusion and poor customer service.
5899,Wells Fargo is misrepresenting and contradicting attached credit report.
5900,Denied credit increase.
5901,"Overview : The Wells Fargo Signature Visa Card advertises that points are worth {$1.00} per 100 points when redeemed for cash and {$1.00} per 100 points when redeemed for airline tickets. Last year I redeemed points without any issues. This year I redeemed points that were redeemed and charged per the above conversion rate of {$1.00} per 100 points for airline tickets. However, per the following details, Wells Fargo actually obtained super discounted group block rate tickets with major restrictions beyond standard airline tickets, the most extreme being the inability to select or confirm seats until check-in. 

My initial written complaint to Wells Fargo was rejected, based upon their interpretation of terminology contained in one of their many on-line Terms and Conditions. 

I then filed a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. After this complaint was filed, I was called by representatives of Wells Fargo who indicated that some type of "" error '' had occurred. My flight ( leaving for XXXX XX/XX/18 XXXX was already overbooked so they could not fix the "" error '' by reserving any seats on my flight, which seems to indicate that the type of tickets Wells Fargo reserved were somewhere between standard tickets and standby tickets. They said that I would probably have seating somewhere on the airplane due to the early date of my reservation, but that even if seats were available at check-in the odds of having 2 seats together were minimal. 

Wells Fargo finally replaced my XXXX reservation with one on XXXX XXXX on the same dates but not at as convenient a time. This time with reserved seats but not the airline I originally chose. 

Several issues remain : 1 ) I consider Wells Fargo 's action as to me personally as more of a Mitigation of Damages than a Full Resolution of my issue. 

2 ) The most important issue is that Wells Fargo initially defended their actions as consistent with their standard business business practices, but then only contended there was an "" error '' after I filed a formal Complaint w/ XXXX XXXX XXXX ( I am not sure what the current status of that Complaint is, but they also suggested I share the same information with the CFPB ). My strong suspicion is that Wells Fargo is also using the same process for thousands of their other customers and will continue doing so until the issue becomes public and you require Wells Fargo to stop this procedure. 

3 ) Airlines may be also be knowingly or unknowingly complicit in this process by delivering E-tickets to customers showing the full price of their standard retail tickets. This might have the legitimate purpose of keeping discounts and/or rebates secret from full price customers. It might also be a process similar to when auto manufacturers provide "" list price '' documentation to dealers to assist sales negotiations - but everyone knows how this works. For Wells Fargo to advertise a credit card based on a specific rewards value process, redeem points based on the full retail cost of standard airline tickets - but then actually deliver discount tickets one step above standby tickets is dishonest and probably fraudulent. 

These are the details : I located a XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) flight from XXXX to XXXX, XXXX for XX/XX/2018, returning from XXXX to XXXX on XX/XX/2018. Instead of purchasing two round-trip tickets, total price {$1600.00}, I asked Wells Fargo 's Go Far Rewards to get the tickets for me based on redeeming some of my credit card points. 

The reservation was done at some point, and my account was charged XXXX points based on an advertised conversion rate of 100 points per {$1.00} of tickets ' price. For some time I was unable to get verification from XXXX that reservations were actually made, so I called Wells Fargo for assistance. After several revised confirmation letters from Go Far Rewards, Wells Fargo finally claimed in writing and during a phone call from their executive offices that my reservations were appropriately made pursuant to what was allowed per their standard Terms and Conditions. 

It appears that Wells Fargo has been using a travel agency called XXXX XXXX to outsource airline ticket purchases. It turns out that XXXX XXXX did not make reservations for and purchase the XXXX XXXX tickets I requested, but instead purchased super-discounted agency tickets from XXXX with special restrictions. This information was confirmed by friends in XXXX who contacted XXXX directly and confirmed that the tickets that had been reserved for me were not standard XXXX tickets but instead special discount tickets. XXXX would not verify the exact amount of the discount but only said this class of ticket was considerably discounted from their standard ticket 's retail price. 

The area of most concern is that with the tickets purchased by XXXX XXXX, seat reservations cant be made until flight check-in, contrary to standard XXXX tickets where seats can be reserved and even upgraded immediately. This means that its possible there may not be any available seats by check-in, and even if seats are still available, there's no way to confirm people can sit together. I had enough concerns having 2 seats in separate areas of an airplane for an almost 12 hour international flight. Imagine the same issues for a family of 5? 

It appears these super-discounted tickets are meant for corporate travel management companies and group tours handled by travel agencies where the travel management company or travel agency coordinates seating and obtains discounts to lower overall airline costs, what their clients are concerned with. This doesn't work for individuals making travel plans assuming they are actually getting standard airline tickets. 

Last year when I redeemed points for 4 airline tickets from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX my points were redeemed for standard tickets. I was able to immediately reserve airline seats to ensure we all sat together. One strange did happen however. Because of a slight change in airline departure time, I was given written notification of the change, but for some reason notification re : 2 tickets came from Wells Fargo and notification for 2 of the tickets came from XXXX XXXX. Im assuming they were undergoing some issues with a transition. 

What seems to have happened over the past year is that at least a portion of the work of Wells Fargo 's Go Far Rewards Fulfillment Department has been outsourced to XXXX XXXX. My understanding if that XXXX XXXX primarily provides Corporate Travel Management Services to Wells Fargo to manage and reduce costs for internal Wells Fargo business travel. They may also  operate in some situations as a regular Travel Agency. Im not sure what type of financial arrangement Wells Fargo has with XXXX XXXX, but its clear that Wells Fargo does not generally make their existence public, except for notification within their on-line Terms and Conditions. All written documentation now comes on Wells Fargo letterhead, and when you call Wells Fargo about a Go Far Rewards travel issue, you will probably eventually be transferred to a XXXX XXXX employee without any notification as to who they are. When XXXX XXXX supervisors have called me they identify themselves as calling from Wells Fargo 's XXXX XXXX. I'm not sure if this general lack of transparency as to the existence of XXXX XXXX is relevant, but it might be something to note. 

Wells Fargo seems to possibly be defrauding at least a portion of their Signature Visa Card customers. It is possible that my situation is an isolated incident and individual "" error. '' However, based on the details of my complaint and Wells Fargo 's recent track record, it seems probable there are many other cases involving other Wells Fargo customers. 

I would greatly appreciate your assistance."
5912,"For the past few months Wells Fargo has been increasing my payments each month. Although I have not been charging over XXXX each and every month. 

The increase is only due to my amount of saving in the account, I have been saving money to pay for my soon admission to a XXXX home, my savings are NOT DISPOSABLE INCOME!, Wells Fargo is trying to extort money from me since as a result of my saving amount in the checking account. 

Wells Fargo could care less that, I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX citizen on social low social security XXXX income. 

these increase in fees are inhibiting my ability to meet my basic human needs of food, prescriptions etc rent etc. but Wells Fargo has absolutely no value for me as a loyal for over the past 10 years, they just want my money, they dont care that my refrigerator is bare, I cant purchase my XXXX  and XXXX medication this month.. I now have a XXXX notice, before a XXXX is available at the XXXX home..

5932,Wells Fargo customer service Calle me XX/XX/2022 to make a payment over the phone. I provided them with my routing number and account number to deduct the funds from my checking account. The payment was processed successfully and funds were taken out of my account. Two days later I received a call indicating I was past due. I explained that I made a payment over the phone but they showed no payment had been applied. They then transferred me to the lost payment department. They requested I print out a copy from my bank account and fax the information over to them. I sent over the fax XX/XX/2022 and received confirmation that the fax was successfully sent. I have called several times times to check and see if the misapplied payment had been credited to my account with no resolution. As of today XX/XX/2022 I am still getting phone calls of a delinquent nature. They have yet to adjust my account accordingly. Whatever you can do to help resolve this issue will be greatly appreciated.

Further as of XX/XX/2022, they have not returned my funds and when I called, they are now trying to tell me that they have to "" research '' this and that it will take until XX/XX/XXXX, and that additionally since my bank account is a non Well Fargo account, it will take an additional 11 days to return the funds. Further, when I now go into the mobile app and the desktop computer website, I am not able to change the autopay??? How is it that they can take money from my account in hours yet take 27 days to return my funds from my initial request on XX/XX/2022. They claim to be doing the best that they can. Really? If they are doing this to me, I am going to say that it is more likely than not, this is their standard way of cheating customers. Seems to be a pattern Wells Fargo. Lastly, when I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was told it would take up to 48 hours for a supervisor to call me back. How can this be possible that they can hold my funds for 27 days? I am not getting clear answers from them and the story changes from one day to the next. They refer to their "" process '' yet can not tell me what that process is nor be held accountable. You can do better Wells Fargo and you need to do better."
